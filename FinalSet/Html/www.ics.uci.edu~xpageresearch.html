<h3><bold>Adoption of Location-Sharing Social Media</bold></h3>
				<p>
I recently received the Yahoo! Best Dissertation Fellowship Award for this work. My thesis focuses on multiple aspects of location-sharing social media:
<li>Privacy Concerns, Privacy Management </li>
<li>Technology Adoption, Use and Non Use</li>
<li>Trait-based influences (e.g. personality, coping style, communication style)</li>
<li>Values in Design</li>
<li>User Interface/Interaction Design</li>
				</p>

				<p>
This research has resulted in several <a href="publications.html">publications</a> and has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Disney Research, Samsung and Yahoo! Labs. The <a href="http://isr.uci.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> website gives an <a href="http://isr.uci.edu/content/factors-influencing-adoption-and-usage-location-sharing-social-media">overview</a> of several findings from this research. <br/><br/><br/>
			
<p>				<h3><bold>Social Navigation</bold></h3>
				<img src="Footprints.jpg" class="right" style="margin-top:0px;" alt="swirl" />
I have investigated the influence of social navigation on how people set their privacy preferences, particularly instant messaging. See our <a href="http://bit.ly/LitHelpDOI">CSCW '11 paper</a> for more information. This work was funded by National Science Foundation grants.</p><br/>
				<h3><bold>Green Transportation</bold></h3>
				<p>
	<img src="mickey-green.jpg" class="left" style="margin-top:0px;" alt="swirl" />
In conjunction with Disney Research, I researched carpooling incentives and the possibility of using location-sharing services for dynamic carpool matching.

<p>
				<h3><bold>Information Disclosure</bold></h3>
We are studying information disclosure behaviors in interpersonal relationships and comparing them with disclosure behaviors towards organizations.
</p>
<p>
				<h3><bold>Haptic Navigation Interfaces for Global Positioning Systems (GPS)</bold></h3>
	<img src="toyota-gps.jpg" class="right" style="margin-top:0px;" alt="swirl" />
I investigated and prototyped new haptic interactions with GPS for Toyota (back in 2003). This included safer and simpler navigation interactions. We built novel haptic inputs and outputs. This work was funded by Toyota and Stanford University and recognized by the James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation in its Student Engineering Design Competition.

			<h3><bold>Information Risk (Industry Products)</bold></h3>
I have worked on enterprise solutions to information risk problems, using user-centric methods to define and design software that assists organizations and teams. <a href="http://www.nextpage.com/">NextPage</a> Document Retention assists organizations who have mobile, distributed work teams with documents, emails and other important records and communications scattered across end user devices. This tool allows them to manage document retention and disposition, making sure they retain the right versions and properly dispose of others in accordance with document retention policy and legislative mandates. With document retention disasters such as Arthur Andersen and Enron, firms are now held accountable to ensure they are complying with document retention policies.</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>
I have also worked on tools for coordinating document workflow for mobile, distributed work teams, working off of mobile devices. NextPage Collaboration addresses common workflow problems that are much more challenging when documents are sitting outside a central document repository. Problems such as: Who has the latest version? Which versions did she work off of? Which version am I looking at? NextPage Collaboration tracks a complete geneology of the various versions sitting on everyone's devices. Teams can have clarity without having to check the document in to a central repository, nor hold off on edits until they can coordinate with others.
