<td width ="80%">
My goal in ICS-21 is for students to begin learning the general principles of
  programming: how to specify, design, code, document, test, debug, evaluate,
  and maintain computer software.
To make these principles concrete, we will explore them by studying and using
  the Java programming language.
This course assumes no prior programming experience, so it will meticulously
  explain everything that students need to understand programming; but,
  it will move at a quick pace, so be prepared to work hard.
The intellectual content of this coures can be neatly divided into three 
  main subject areas: Algorithmics, Abstraction, and Analysis (the triple-As):
  <ul>
    <li>Algorithmics: types, literals, variables/state/references, expressions,
          exceptions, and control structures.
    <li>Abstraction: constants, compound types (interfaces and classes
          -including array classes), methods, libraries, inheritance
          (including polymorphism), collection classes, and reflection.
     <li>Analysis: pragmatics, aesthetics (style), correctness
          (testing/debugging), efficiency (big-O notation), and numerical
          accuracy.
   </ul>  
<p>
This course emphasizes Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
The foundational unit of OOP is the <i>class</i>: a syntactic structure that
  describes and encapsulates both the behavior (methods implemented by control
  structures) and state (fields implementing data structures) of objects.
Classes provide an excellent motivation and context for exploring most
  interesting aspects of programming.
We can view software as a collection of interacting objects, which are
   constructed from classes; often with many objects constructed from
   the same class.
<p>
The main programming methodology that we will learn and employ is
   iterative-enhancement, which decomposes a large project into a series of
   mini-projects (each is called a phase).
Starting from a kernel, and writing a program for each of these phases in
   sequence, results in a solution to the original project.
Each phase requires repeatedly specifying, designing, coding, documenting,
   testing, debugging, and evaluating a testable program that is a small
   extension of the capabilities of the program produced in the previous phase.
Sometimes we will use JUnit to devise tests for our code, and then
  automatically test it (and retest it when we make changes).
<p>
Java is a medium-sized language that includes a very large library: beginning
   programmers cannot learn all of it in a quarter.
With this in mind, this course (and ICS-22/-23) is designed to teach you the
  fundamentals of Java as well as how to learn a programming language, so that
  you can learn additional Java language or library features (or another
  language) later, on your own.
In particular, we will study and use tools for browsing, debugging, and
  documenting large programs.
<p>
Although we will mostly study <i>programming-in-the-small</i>, we will
  concentrate on the technical and lingual issues of building large,
  reliable programmed systems that are constructed from standard components.
Expect to cover most relevant Java language features thoroughly, but also
  to spend much time discussing the less concrete -but ultimately more
  general and important- aspects of programming.
Programming style is a particularly important topic: to understand
  programming, we really need to develop appropriate aesthetics that allow
  us to separate "elegant" programs from "hacks".
As in any writing activity, we must also learn to be self-critical of our own
  creations, so that we can continually improve them; this skill is difficult
  to acquire, and its importance extends well beyond the domain of
  programming.
<p>
Finally, to become an expert in any discipline, we must master its
   terminology.
Fluency with technical terms allows us to communicate -and even to think-
   more accurately and concisely.
Therefore, the materials in this course will define, illustrate, and
   repeatedly use many important technical terms concerning programming.
Take the time required to master them. An old Chinese proverb says,
     "The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names."

The primary materials for this course will come from web pages that I have
  written (and am continually updating).
These web pages include readings, problem sets, and programming assignments
  (and a bunch of infrastructure material, like this syllabus).
Typically, these web pages will be shorter than chapters in a textbook, but
  they are more densely packed with information; thus, you will still spend
  about the same amount of time studying my web pages as you would reading a
  textbook.
<p>
<!--
The UCI Bookstore will sell two textbooks that traditionally are used 
  throughout the ICS-21/-22/-23 course sequence.
If you took ICS 21 here, you will probably have the first book already, which
  contains much useful material about the fundamentals of Java (and covers
  quite a few advanced topics as well).
-->
If you don't have any textbook that discusses the Java programming language, I
  recommend buying the book by Horstmann mentioned below; you can read it to
  fill in any gaps in your knowledge of Java, and use it as a resource
  in ICS-22/-23.
The other two books are also useful if you plan to work more with Java,
  either by taking more classes at UCI or exploring Java by yourself.

<!-- Computing Platforms and Programming Environments -->

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Computing Platforms and Programming Environments</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The standard computing platforms for this course are
  <ul>
    <li>Intel-based PCs running the Windows XP or Vista Operating System (OS).
    <li>Macintosh PCs running the OS X operating system
    <li>Either PC running Linux.
  </ul>
<p>
Programming courses at most schools are moving towards a model in which most
  students use their own computers (or those of their roommates or friends) to
  complete their programming assignments.
All the software used in ICS-21 is available, for free, on the web.
We are assuming that students have already installed a web browser, and have a
  high-speed connection to the World-Wide Web: e.g., via the campus network or
  a DSL line; having only a modem will make it more difficult, but not
  impossible, to work off campus.
  <p>
The programming environment that we will use is Eclipse (version 3.6.2, also
   called Helios): it is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
   including a project manager, editor, compiler, debugger, class browser,
   help facility, etc.
We will also use the Sun Java version 1.6.24 compiler and runtime system with
  this IDE.
In addition, realVNC (Virtual Network Computing) allows students on their own
   computers to seek remote debugging help from a pool of course staff.
This software, and others useful for the course, are available through the
  <a href="../../../common/online.html">Online Resources</a>
  link (see <b>Course Software</b>, near the top).
We will be happy to help you install this software on your portable,
  if you can bring it to lab (or the instructor's office hours).
<p>
Talk to your instructor or TA immediately if you are experiencing any problems
  with your computing platform.
Typically it takes only a few days before everyone has correctly downloaded and
  installed the necessary software, and learned how to use it properly.
Using this software is integral to every programming assignment during the
  quarter, so it is best to be aggressive and download, install, and start
  mastering this software quickly.

<td width ="80%">
In addition to using their own machines, students can do their coursework on
  the machines in the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab">ICS Labs</a>,
  which are described on this link and in more detail below.
The main upside of using the ICS labs is that it will be easy to get ICS-21
  staff to help you there; the main downside is that you will not be using
  your own computer -unless you have a portable and bring it to the labs to
  get the best of both worlds.
Read the following to learn about 
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php">
 ICS Lab Account Activation</a>.
Whether or not you plan on doing your homework in a lab, you must activate your
  ICS account and know how to use it for in-class programming exams.
<p>
ICS-21 schedules required lab hours (to complement required lecture hours),
  during which students can learn how to use software tools and work on their
  programming assignments, all under the supervision of ICS-21 staff members.
<p>
The lab in <b>ICS 364</b> is a general purpose lab in which no courses are
  scheduled.
It is open to students on weekdays and weekends:
   MTuWThT 8:00am - 10:00pm,
   F 8:00am - 8:00pm,
   and SaSu 12:00noon - 6:00pm.
You can examine the
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/lab_schedule/index.php">
  Lab Schedules</a> for all these labs.
<p>
<!--
For information about where and when ICS-21 staff members are in labs,
 check the
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/helpschedule.html">Help Schedule</a>.
Generally, ICS-21 staff will do all their out-of-lab consulting in ICS
  364.
<p>
-->
If you find it inconvenient to use these labs, and would rather work from
  your dorm room or off campus, ICS-21 staff will also provide more limited
  online help through AOL Instant Messaging.
If you have installed realVNC on your computer, we will be able to monitor and
  manipulate your computer directly from ours.
We will discuss the details of this system for help, and how to use it, early
  in the quarter.
<p>
During in-class programming exams, you will have to write your programs on
  the PCs in our labs, so you should plan acquire some knowledge of these
  machines, even if you are using your own machine for all other coursework.
Once you start Eclipse, what computer you are on makes little difference:
   PCs, Macs, and Linux systems operate similarly.
Finally, although the machines in the ICS labs also provide some external
  storage space (on a Unix system), it is an excellent idea to obtain some kind
  of USB memory to back-up all the work you do, both on your own computer and
  in our labs.
<p>
Every quarter some students have storage problems (lose parts of their work)
  that would be easily avoided if they backed-up their work regularly on their
  own USB memory.

I welcome students, individually or in small groups, to come by and talk with
  me during my Office Hours,
<!-- (see the

-->
  or whenever I happen to be in my office with the door open.
If we need to talk, but you cannot come during my office hours, please call
   me so that we can arrange an alternative time to meet; or, maybe we even can
   resolve the entire issue over the telephone.
Also, see the email section below, for an excellent way to ask short questions
   and arrange meetings.
<p>
I will be glad to talk with you about any of the ICS-21/-22/-23 courses, 
   Computer Science, UCI, or whatever else you want to discuss.
Although UCI is a large school, ICS is a smaller school within it, and ICS
  promotes opportunities for close faculty-student interaction, especially
  with instructors who are lecturers.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, not enough students take advantage of this
  opportunity at UCI.
<p>
I especially encourage students who are having problems in the course to visit
  me immediately; I know that this is asking a lot, but the payoff for
  recognizing the situation and acting on it immediately is tremendous.
The primary reason that students fail to thrive in programming courses is that
  they fall behind in their work -often because of what is initially a small
  misunderstanding; but, because of the cumulative nature of this course,
  even a small misunderstanding can quickly grow into a big one.
Often, I can quickly diagnose and rectify such a problem one-on-one.
<p>
Getting help fast can critically affect your overall performance in
  this course: many times I've seen students start performing one grade
  level higher after coming in to get help during my office hours
  (a typical visit lasts for about 20 minutes).

If you have a small question (one requiring little back-and-forth discussion),
  and cannot directly contact me or any of staff, please ask it by sending me
  email (<a href="mailto:pattis@ics.uci.edu">pattis@ics.uci.edu</a>).
It has been my experience that the act of writing a detailed description of a
  problem (detailed enough so that someone not physically present can
  understand it) often leads a student to his/her own solution of the problem.
Frequently, before I even get a chance to read my email, I receive a second
  message saying,  "Please ignore my earlier message, I solved the problem
   myself."
I believe that the seeds of the solution are sown in the act of carefully
  composing the first email message.
Here is quote on my website about this phenomenon.
<p>
<table width ="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="1" rules=all">
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
Another effective [debugging] technique is to explain your code to someone
  else.
This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself.
Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed
  "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you."
This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.
One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.
Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before
  they could speak to a human counselor.

<p>

When I am not teaching nor attending meetings, I try to answer email every few
  hours during the day.
I normally will not answer email sent after about 10:00pm until early the next
  morning (but I'll typically answer it by the next morning).
If you have problems late at night "problems that the staff cannot help
  resolve" please send me email summarizing your problems, and then go to work
  on something else (or if it is really late, go to sleep).
By planning to finish assignments early, you can protect yourself against a big
  problem that arises at night and cannot be fixed until the next day: you
  really don't want to have to fix such a problem the night that an assignment
  is due.
<p>
For many problems -ones that are of general interest to the class- I would
  prefer it if you would use a MessageBoard forum (see below) so everyone can
  see the question and its answer.
<p>
Finally, the Electronic Educational Environment (EEE) at UCI creates and
  maintains course-wide mailing lists.
I have created a "merged" mailing list for all my ICS 21 students (which also
  includes those students signed up for CSE 21, both in the Sammueli School of
  Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science).
All members of our course (staff and students) can use this mailing list, whose
  email address is <b>ics21-S12@classes.uci.edu</b>
All messages sent via this discussion list will be archived on the
  <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/S12/16000/" target="main">
  Email Archive</a> web page.
Mostly student-initiated questions/discussions should use the forums mentioned
  below, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the
  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g.,
  Checkmate not responding to program submissions.

<p>
If you have a question of general interest (of interest to many students in the
  course, not just you), then you use one of the forums on the EEE
  MessageBoard.
These forums allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as
  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).
For example, if a lecture note, programming assignment, etc. contains unclear
  (or even contradictory) information, post a note about it to the appropriate
  forum, asking for a clarification.
I, or someone from my staff will read and reply to whatever questions are
  asked.
In fact, if you read a question on a forum, and know the answer -or generally
  have something to contribute to the topic, I encourage you to to post a reply
  to help resolve the problem even sooner.
Thus, you can use the forums to discuss any course materials out-of-class.
<p>
Again, forums are appropriate for questions relevant to most students in the
  course; directly email me (see above) for questions of a more
  individualistic nature.
Obviously students should neither solicit nor post answers to take-home
  quizzes, programming assignments, or anything else that would be interpreted
  as academic misconduct (which is discussed in greater detail below).
<p>
It is an excellent idea to check these forums whenever you are about to starg
  doing coursework, to keep up to date on any coursewide discussions.

<p>
These sessions are not lectures (and attending them is not a replacement for
  attending my lectures).
You must come prepared to ask questions based on what you understand from
  lecture, and what is still confusing; the TA will answer your questions,

We expect most CMU students will be using their own computers (in their dorm
  rooms) to complete their coursework; or maybe they will use the computers of
  roommates or  friends, but generally not computers in CMU clusters.
To facilitate getting debugging help while in your dorm room, we have created 
  RATS: Remote Access Tutoring System.
<p>
To run RATS, you must first have downloaded and installed the VNC (Virtual
  Network Computing) software on your computer
  (available for downloading from the
  <a href="../../../common/online.html">Online Resources</a> page).
We suggest that you do this early in the quarter, when you download the
  Code-Warrior IDE and Java.
The best web links and instructions for downloading all these products is on
  the <a href="../../../common/handouts/installation.html">Installing Course Software</a> page.
<p>
If you want to seek help from the 15-100 or 15-111 staff while debugging a
  program, click the RATS link on the course home page.
A web page will ask you to identify yourself with your Andrew user ID and the
  last five digits of your CMU ID; when validated, you will be switched to
  another web page that will ask you to enter the number of a phone that you
  can answer and a brief description
  of your programming problem.
RATS will then enter you into a queue of students waiting for help.
<p>
A pool of CAs will serve students in this queue,in the order they submit their
  problems.
You will be contacted (on your telephone) by the next free tutor (maybe one of
  my CAs, maybe someone else).
Both the student and tutor will launch VNC with a special session password
  generated by RATS.
<p>
By using VNC and your telephone, the tutor will be able to see and manipulate
  your computer screen (move the mouse, type into the editor) while talking to
  you on the telephone.
Of course, you can still manipulate your screen and the CA will see it too.
The interaction will simulate one in which the CA is sitting next to you:
  talking to you, gathering information, and exploring potentional solutions
  with you on your computer.
Each of you can take control of the computer to perfom some task, with the
  other able to hear and see what is happening.
<p>
RATS is to be used to debug programs only; it is not to be used for extended
  help sessions.
There are daily opportunities to meet with staff members to discuss more
  general issues.
You will be told more about RATS in class, and be required to complete a small
  RATS drill by the second week of class, designed to familiarize you with
  RATS.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><a name="Before"><b>Before Class</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
I will place almost all the course materials on the World Wide Web (WWW).
I expect students to read the required lecture materials <b>before</b> class,
  and work out solutions to the assigned problems (sometimes you can
  test/verify your solutions on the computer).
Note that doing the reading and working on the assigned problems <b>before</b>
  class is a critical step in the learning process: students must be familiar
  with the material to get the maximum benefit from the class discussions and
  problem-solving sessions.
<p>
Solving the assigned problems is especially important, as it "proves" that a
  student has not only read the material, but "understood" it is as well.
Here understood means "has used the information operationally to solve 
 problems".
If you have difficultly with a problem, it indicates that you should probably
  review the related reading.
<p>
I will allow students to work together on these problems: to discuss them, to
  analyze how to approach solving them, and to collaborate on their actual
  solution.
Such a discussion must go beyond copying another student's answer: it involves
  completely understanding the answer and the process whereby it was reached,
  which includes acquiring the ability to analyze and solve similar problems.
In fact, students will be required to solve similar problems on (almost) weekly
  take-home quizzes, on which no collaboration is allowed.
Don't cheat yourself in this aspect of the course.
<p>
<!---
Our TA will hold help sessions almost every evening to aid you with
  understanding each reading and how to solve its problems (see the 
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/helpschedule.html" target="main">
    Help Schedule</a> web page for details).

During class, I will discuss the lecture material, mostly by answering
  questions on the reading(s) and amplifying on those topics that need further
  discussion.
Come to class with questions about any unclear parts of the reading or any
  problems that you could not solve (or are unsure of your answer).
Class motto:  "Those who are ashamed of asking are ashamed of learning.
  The only stupid question is the one left unasked."
<p>
I will randomly call on students to present their solutions to selected
  assigned problems, and discuss them as well (please be prepared).
I may also ask students to solve, either individually or in groups, other
  problems relating to the material; we will then compare and discuss these
  solutions.
Thus, I expect most "lectures" to be interactive, with students participating
  fully.
<p>
I expect students to attend class daily.
During the 30 years that I have been teaching, I have observed a strong
  correlation between attending class and understanding the material (which 
  ultimately affects grades).
Having all the course materials on the World Wide Web (WWW) is a great
  resource, but just as important is coming to class -and paying attention,
  once you are there, and participating by volunteering information when you
  know it and asking questions when you are confused.
<p>
I encourage you to participate by raising your hand; sometimes I may finish
  the point I'm making before calling on you, but please keep your hand up if
  you want to speak.
If you have a question about the material, it typically means that I have
  explained something incorrectly, poorly, or incompletely, and that other
  students have (or will soon have, maybe right after they leave the classroom)
  the same question.
So, it would be best for all of us to correct the problem immediately in class
  by someone bringing it to my attention.
In summary, this class runs on the Dershowitz principle:
  "Question authority; but raise your hand first".

I expect students to attend class daily, arriving on time.
The announcements made at the start of class are often very important; also,
  I reserve the right to give small pop-quizzes on the readings at the start
  of class. 
I expect students to neither carry on private conversations, nor use
  their computers to answer email, surf the web, day trade stocks, or
  perform any other activities unrelated to this course.
<p>
Ringing cell phones disrupt my lectures.
Unless you are responsible for someone's life, your cell phone should be
  turned off.
Otherwise, you should set it to operate in some silent mode (as mine will be
  set); if it rings silently, please leave the class, with a minimum of
  disruption to the rest of the students, to answer it.
If your cell phone rings audibly in class, you will be charged a 2 pt point
  deduction the first time, and a 5 point deduction for all subsequent
  infractions.
Finally, if you know that you must leave early, please sit near a door,
  so that you can exit quietly and without disturbing the class.
<p>
Overall, please strive to be a considerate class member, both to me and to
  your fellow students.

I will assign nine take-home Quizes to ensure that everyone is keeping pace
 learning the course material and is able to express themselves on technical
  matters both in English and Java.
Each will have problems similar to those assigned daily in class (and similar
  to those on upcomming written exams; working these quizzes is a major way to
  "study" for these exams).
These quizzes will be a take-home instrument: most will be distributed at the
  end of class on Friday and collected at the start of class on the following
  Monday.
During the weekend, you will have as much time as you need to work on the
  quizzes.
<p>
The quizzes are open-book: you will be able to use any class materials, or any
  other materials from the web, to answer its questions.
But, you may not communicate with anyone about these quizzes nor their
  solutions; nor should you search for/look at solutions to these specific
  problems on the web. 
The quizzes are also open-computer: by that I mean that you may use a computer
  to check your work.
<!-- I will allow two students to show their answers to a third student (who

I will assign six programming assignments to ensure that everyone is
  getting the necessary hands-on programming experience.
While working on these programs, you will acquire a solid and fine-tuned
  understanding of the course material as well as gain important
  <i>process of programming</i> skills.
Programs will typically be discussed and started in Lab on Thursdays, and be
  due (submitted electronically) Wednesday evening at 11:30pm (typically
  1 week after they are assigned).
<p>
Students will often be required to work in groups of two on programming
  assignments.
Such an approach is called
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html" tarket ="_top">
  Pair Programming</a>.
On student from each pair submit all parts of the programming assignment
  with both their names on it (in the code files).
Apart from your pair, you can get <b>general</b> help from anyone (Instructor,
  TA, Lab Tutors, friends, etc.) on programs.
The best kind of help to get is oral: where you describe the problem, possibly
  showing your code, and then get an oral answer that you understand and
  translate into code.
In such instances, you are learning. 
<p>
<b>You may neither copy nor transcribe (written or orally) any parts of another
    student's program, nor have another student sit down and correct your
    program.</b> 
<p>
When you submit your programs for grading, you are expected to understand all
  parts of them and have improved your <i>process of programming</i> skills
  while writing and debugging them.
Students who complete their own programs in this way will be well prepared for
  the In-Class Programming Exams; students who get too much help (on purpose,
  or accidentally) will have a difficult time on these exams, which
  can severely impact their grade.    
<p>
You will submit your solutions to programming assignments through a special
  web page that records the time they are submitted.
You can resbumit your programs as many times as you want.
We will grade only the final submission.
<p>
To promote good time management skills, if you submit a program at least 24
  hours  before it is due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.
If you submit a program 48 hours early, you will receive 2 points.
You can gain no more than 2 points of extra credit by early submission.
For a 45 point assignment, this extra credit is equivalent to almost half a
  letter grade improvement.
In general, it is a bad idea to submit programs more than 48 hours early
  (typically we will return graded programs on Monday, and you should wait to
  receive them and see how they are grades before submitting your new program).
<p>
I know from long teaching experience that students who work ahead of the
  deadlines learn more, in a less stressed envrionment: students working right
  up to a deadline are more concerned with getting the right answer and less
  concerned with learning anything.
On the other side of this coin, I will not accept any late programs.
So, you must turn in your work on time: if you turn in a partially working
  program on time, it will receive partial credit; if you do not turn in
  anything on time, then I must assume you did no work on the program, and you
  will receive no credit.
Therefore, always turn in whatever work you have finished by the official due
  time.

I will assign one Midterm Written Exam and one Final Written Exam to

Its problems will be similar to those assigned on homework, and especially on

These written exams are closed-book: you will not be able use any notes nor

<p>
The best way to study for these exams is to do all the homework and quizzes 
  (and programs -sometimes material from programming assignments appear on
  these exams) and review these quizzes (and programs).
Cramming will be of little help: we will cover too much material during
  the quarter.
We will also hold review sessions before these exams.
Students are expected to be able to do these problems both quickly and

  classes; and the fourth on writing a class that stores/maniuplates an array.
Of course, you will have to know lots of general material about programming
  in Java to solve all these problems effectively (as well as how to use the

This is straight calculation, not based on a curve.
I tend to grade programming assignments liberally, but quizzes,
  written/programming exams conservatively.
I expect about 30% of the student to earn As, about 30% to earn Bs,
  about 20% to earn Cs, and about 20% to earn Ds or Fs.
This course is NOT graded on a curve, so these are only expectations from
  past course performance, not mandated numbers; your numbers can 
  be higher or lower.
<!---
FYI: for the Spring 07 quarter, the actual breakdown was: 27% As, 24% Bs, 25%
  Cs, 13 Ds, and 11 % Fs.

<p>
After finishing 4 quizzes, 4 programming assignments, the midterm, and the

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><a name="Policy"><b>Policy</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The decision as to whether a student has cheated depends on the intent of an
  assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of
  the student. 
The following two guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has
   occurred on programming, which is the fuzziest area:
<ul>
  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent
         development and implementation of a program results in two or more 
         solutions so similar that one solution can be converted to the
         other(s) by a series of simple transformations.
  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if a student who completed an assignment 
         cannot explain both the intricacies of the solution and 
         the techniques used to generate that solution.
</ul>
It is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating that would cover
  all cases, because each situation is important enough to merit careful,
  individual scrutiny; however, it is helpful to have guidelines and
   precedents.
<p>
Here are some examples that are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating.
<p>
<b>Examples of CHEATING</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own (with or
        without his/her knowledge), without it including a statement of
        collaboration in the solution.
  <li>Allowing another student to turn in your work, in whole or in part, as
        his/her own, without it including a statement of collaboration in the
        solution.
  <li>Turning in a completely duplicated assignment.
      Even if all the comments are changed, all the variables names are
        changed, all the whitespace is changed, and the code appears in a
        different order: it is still the same program.
  <li>Several students/pairs writing one assignment and turning in multiple
        copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as an individual
        student's/pair's work, without it including a statement of
        collaboration in the solution.
  <li>After receiving graded written work, returning written work, for
        regrading, which has been altered.
  <li>Finding a solution to the same problem on the web and submitting it
        without explicit attribution in the solution.
  <li>Stealing an examination or solution from the instructor.
</ul>
Generally, you should NOT EXAMINE, by reading hardcopy or by copying a file,
  the program of any other student (nor should you let anyone examine or make
  a copy of your files).
Doing so can easily lead to an intended or unintended academic violation.
<p>
If you ever feel that after talking to someone about a program, which is legal,
  your solution will be very similar to theirs, cite the consultation in the
  header comment in your program.
Doing so protects you from University disciplinary action (although the
  instructor is free to grade the material as he/she sees fit).
<p>
<b>Examples of NOT CHEATING</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course's staff.
  <li>Submitting one assignment for a group of students if group work is 
        explicitly permitted (or required, as in pair-programming).
  <li>Getting or giving help about using the computers.
  <li>Getting or giving help about solving syntax errors.
  <li>High level discussions of course material to better understand them.
  <li>Discussing assignments to better understand them.
</ul>
Again, the key here is not studying, verbatim, someone else's code, and then
  reproducing it as your own work.
It is too easy to copy such code without really understanding it.
Technically, for programming assignments, even understanding the resulting code
  is not enough (if someone else wrote it): you should also play an active role
  in synthesizing and debugging it.
The course is as much about skills as about knowledge.

<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><a name="AutomaticDetection"><b>Automatic Detection of Cheating</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Recently, various cheating-detection software systems have become widely
  available.
Some use search engines to compare selected portions of submitted papers to
  content on the web.
In the context of programming, they compare each student's program to those
  submitted by his/her classmates (for this quarter, and any previous
  quarters if the assignment has been repeated).
This software does not compare programs exactly: it ignores format changes,
  variable name changes, and a variety of well-know transformations that
  change the look of code but not its underlying logic.
<p>
Many courses in ICS use this software to spot potential cheating cases.
Once it identifies suspicious behavior, instructors carefully examine the
  flagged code to make a final determination as to whether students will be
  prosecuted for cheating.
Often instructors can find additional evidence of cheating, once this
  software points them to the simlar code.

ICS will not condone cheating by students in its classes.
When cheating is suspected, instructors will take reasonable action to
  establish whether or not it has actually occurred.
If, in the instructor's opinion it has, the instructor will apply appropriate
  disciplinary policy.
In my courses, for a typical case of cheating, the student will be awarded
  negative credit for the assignment (under the precept that not doing an
  assignment, and receiving no points, is better than cheating on it).
For particular egregious forms of cheating (e.g., cheating on exams, stealing
  another student's work so he/she cannot submit it for credit), higher
  penalties can be extracted (from loss of a letter grade, through immediate
  failure of the course, up through suspension or expulsion from UCI).
<p>
Instructors must contact the student within 15 calendar days of discovering
  evidence of academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work.
Notice of any action taken by an instructor will also be forwarded to the
  Associate Undergraduate Dean of ICS, the Associate Undergraduate Dean of
  the student's home school (if different), and the Office of the Dean of the
  Division of Undergraduate Education.
These offices act as a repository for such information, in case the student
  commits multiple infractions.

<td width ="20%"><a name="FinalWords"><b>Final Words:<br>A Personal Statement</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Cheating undermines the fabric of education.
The atmosphere at UCI (contrary to whatever opinions, prejudices, or
  superstitions you hold) is one of fostering cooperation between faculty and
  students in the pursuit of learning, knowledge, and wisdom.
This course, for example, is graded on an absolute scale, not a curve;
  so, helping other students doesn't affect your grade.
And, if a student cheats for a higher grade, other students do not receive
  lower grades as a result.
<p>
Although it is embarrassing to fail an assignment, getting caught cheating is
  much worse.
I know, though, that students rarely think about getting caught.
But think about it: I often see students break down and cry when they get
  caught cheating and only then start to realize the consequences of their
  actions.
Their stress level goes through the roof and it immediately affects both the
  academic and social aspects of their lives.
The process is distressing for me too, although I must confess that I have been
  hardened by the number of times that I have had to go through it (typically
  multiple times each quarter).
Pursuing these cases at the University level takes a lot of my time, and
  reduces the time that I can spend on more important matters relating to my
  course and my students.
It is definitely a lose-lose situation.
<p>
The #1 excuse that I hear for cheating is, "I was pressed for time, so I
  cheated."
By carefully managing your time, you can avoid this problem.
If you start working early enough, and run into problems (and you should expect
  to run into problems), you will have time for the course staff to help you
  learn to solve them.
Also, I understand that some students take this course only because it is a
  requirement for their major, and that they have little intrinsic interest in
  the subject area; this is not a valid excuse for cheating either.
<p>
I have seen too many instances recently where student A asks a friend, student
  B, for help; specifically, A asks to see B's quiz or code (on paper or in a
  computer file).
Often, A copies B's code (with or without B's knowledge).
I understand that B feels pressure to give A help.
But, B is doing A no favor if A's cheating is discovered; B has made a bad 
 situation (A would receive no credit) worse (A receives negative credit and is
  reported to the Dean of Student Affairs).
And, according to UCI's rules, B can get into trouble for these actions too.
I have seen friendships shattered because A copies B's code without telling B
  what was done, and then both get prosecuted under UCI's rules.
<p>
A similar situation arises with cheating on quiz questions.
I have seen too many students cheat on one question on a quiz and receive a
  negative score for the whole quiz (and letter to the Dean of Student
  affairs), when leaving the question blank would result in a small point
  deduction and no university action.
<p>
In my final statement here, I ask you to pause and reflect on the consequences
  of choosing to cheat at UCI: this includes the impacts that it will have on
  you, your parents, your siblings, your friends, and your fellow classmates
  at UCI.
Cheating is invariably the wrong decision.
