<p><b>Abstract: </b>
For many embedded applications, program code size is a 
critical design factor. One promising approach for reducing 
code size is to employ a "dual instruction set", where 
processor architectures support a normal (usually 32 bit) 
Instruction Set, and a narrow, space-efficient (usually 16 
bit) Instruction Set with a limited set of opcodes and 
access to a limited set of registers. This feature
however, requires compilers that can reduce code size by 
compiling for both Instruction Sets. Existing compiler 
techniques operate at the routine-level granularity and 
are unable to make the trade-off between increased register 
pressure (resulting in more spills) and decreased code size. 
We present a compilation framework for such dual instruction 
sets, which uses a profitability based compiler heuristic 
that operates at the instruction-level granularity and is 
able to effectively take advantage of both Instruction Sets. 
We demonstrate consistent and improved code size reduction
(on average 22%), for the MIPS 32/16 bit ISA. We also show 
that the code compression obtained by this "dual instruction 
set" technique is heavily dependent on the application 
characteristics and the narrow Instruction Set itself.
