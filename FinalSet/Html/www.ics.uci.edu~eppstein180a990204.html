Which nodes to search?  Full-width vs. selective search</H2>

Alpha-beta tells us how to search, but we still need to know when to
expand a node (search its children) and when to just stop and call the
evaluation function.


<H3>The Horizon Effect</H3>

The pseudo-code I've shown you so far searches every move out to a given 
fixed depth (this depth is also known as the <I>horizon</I>.  Although this 
can be quite effective at seeing tactical threats that could be carried out 
within the horizon,
it (obviously) can't detect threats that would take effect past the 
horizon; for instance a depth-8 search (that is, a search four moves deep) 
would likely not have much or any information about a forced checkmate in 
five moves.  What it don't know, it can't defend against, and it would 
simply ignore those long-term threats.  But this sort of fixed-depth 
search can behave even worse when the position contains medium-depth 
threats in which some bad outcome is forced to occur, but where some lines 
have that outcome within the search horizon and some don't.  In that case, 
the program can play horrible pointless moves in an attempt to delay the 
bad outcome long enough that it can't be seen.  This phenomenon is known 
as the <I>horizon effect</I>.

<P>Here's an example.  In the following position, black's bishop is trapped 
by the white pawns.  No matter what black does, the bishop will be taken 
in a few moves; for instance the white rook could maneuver h2-h1-a1-a2 and 
capture the bishop.  That sequence is 8 plys deep, and suppose that the 
black program is searching to a depth of 8 plys.  Probably the best move 
for black in the actual position is to trade off the bishop and pawns,
e.g. bishop x pawn, pawn x bishop.
In the remaining endgame, black's three connected passed pawns may be 
enough to win or draw against the rook.
But, a program searching 8 plys will likely instead move the black pawn 
forwards, checking the white king.  White must respond (e.g. by taking the 
pawn with his king), but that forced response delays the loss of the bishop 
long enough that the program can't see it anymore, and thinks the bishop 
is safe.  In fact, in this position, a fixed-depth program can continue 
throwing away its pawns, delaying the bishop capture a few more moves but 
probably causing the eventual loss of the game.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="990204.gif" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=292 ALT="horizon effect

One way to counter the horizon effect is to add knowledge to your program: 
if it knows from the evaluation that the bishop is trapped, its search 
won't try to delay the capture by throwing away pawns.
Another is to make the search faster and deeper: the more levels your 
program searches, the less likely you are to run across a situation like 
this where it is possible to delay the loss of the bishop past the horizon.
But the most effective general solution is to make the search depth more 
flexible, so that the program searches deeper in the lines where a pawn is 
being given away and less deep in other lines where it doesn't need the 
depth.

<H3>Brute Force and Selectivity</H3>

<P>Shannon's original paper on computer chess listed two possible 
strategies for adjusting the search depth of a game program.

<P>The most obvious is what the pseudo-code I've shown you so far does:
a full-width, brute force search to a fixed depth.  Just pass in a
"depth" parameter
to your program, decrement it by one for each level of search, and stop
when it hits zero.  This has the advantage of seeing even wierd-looking
lines of play, as long as they remain within the search horizon.
But the high branching factor means that it doesn't search any line very 
deeply (bachelor's degree: knows nothing about everything).
And even worse, it falls prey to the horizon effect.
Suppose, in chess, we have a program searching seven levels deep,

<P>The other method suggested by Shannon was selective pruning:
again search to some fixed depth, but to keep the branching factor down
only search some of the children of each node (avoiding the "obviously
bad" moves).  So, it can search much more deeply, but there are lines it
completely doesn't see	(ph.d.: knows everything about nothing).
Shannon thought this was a good idea because it's closer to how humans think.
Turing used a variant of this idea, only searching capturing moves.
More typically one might evaluate the children and only expand the
<I>k</I> best of them where <I>k</I> is some parameter less than the
true branching factor.
	
<P>Unfortunately, "obviously bad" moves are often not bad at all,
but are brilliant sacrifices that win the game.  If you don't find one you
should have made, you'll have to work harder and find some other way to win.
Worse, if you don't see that your opponent is about to spring some such
move sequence on you, you'll fall into the trap and lose.

<P>Nowadays, neither of these ideas is used in its pure form.
Instead, we use a synthesis of both: selective extension.
We search all lines to some fixed depth, but then extend
extend some lines deeper than that horizon.
Sometimes we'll also do some pruning (beyond the safe pruning done by
alpha-beta), but this is usually extremely conservative because it's too
hard to pick out only the good moves;
but we can sometimes pick out and ignore really bad moves.
For games other than chess, with higher branching factors,
it may be necessary to use more aggressive pruning techniques.

<H3>When to extend?</H3>

What is the point of extending?
To get better (more accurate) evaluations.
So, should extend
<OL>
<LI>when the current evaluation is likely to be inaccurate, or
<LI>when the current line of play is a particularly important part of
the overall game tree search
</OL>
(or some combination of both).

<H3>Quiescence Search</H3>

<LI>In chess or other games in which there are both capturing and 
non-capturing moves (checkers, go, fanorona), if there are captures to be made,
the evaluation will change greatly with each capture.

<P><I>Quiescence search</I> is the idea of, after reaching the main
search horizon, running a Turing-like search in which we only expand
capturing moves (or sometimes, capturing and checking) moves.  For games
other than chess, the main idea would be to only include moves which
make large changes to the evaluation.  Such a search must also include
"pass" moves in which we decide to stop capturing.
So, each call to the evaluation function in the main alpha-beta search 
would be replaced by the following, a slimmed down version of alpha-beta 
that only searches capturing moves, and that allows the search to stop if 
the current evaluation is already good enough for a fail high:

<PRE>
    // quiescence search
    // call this from the main alphabeta search in place of eval()

    quiesce(int alpha, int beta) {
        int score = eval();
        if (score >= beta) return score;
        for (each capturing move m) {
            make move m;
            score = -quiesce(-beta,-alpha);
            unmake move m;
            if (score >= alpha) {
                alpha = score;
                if (score >= beta) break;
            }
        }
        return score;
    }
</PRE>
Some people also include checks to the king inside the quiescence search, 
but you have to be careful: because there is no depth parameter, 
quiescence can search a huge number of nodes.  Captures are naturally 
limited (you can only perform 16 captures before you've run out of pieces 
to capture) but checks can go on forever and cause an infinite recursion.

<H3>Selective extensions</H3>

If the position has been active in the recent past, this may be evidence 
that further tactics are coming up, or that some of the previous moves 
were delaying tactics that prevent us from seeing deeply enough to get a 
good evaluation.
So one often increases the search depth if the search passes through
an "interesting" move such as a capture or a check.  In the alpha-beta pseudocode,
this would be accomplished by replacing the depth-1 parameter to the
recursive call to the search routine by the value
depth-1+extension.  You have to be careful not to do this too often,
though, or you could end up with a hugely expanded (even possibly
infinite!) search tree.

<P>One trick helps make sure this extension idea terminate:
only extend by a fraction of a level.  Specifically, make the "depth"
counter record some multiple of the number of levels you really want to
search, say depth=levels*24.  Then, in recursive calls to alpha-beta
search, pass a value of depth-24+extension.  If the extension is always
strictly less than 24, the method is guaranteed to terminate, and you
can choose which situations result in larger or smaller extensions.

<P>It may also be useful to include within the evaluation function 
knowledge about how difficult a position is to evaluate, and extend the 
search on positions that are too difficult.  My program does this: the 
program passes the current depth to the evaluation function.  If the 
position is complicated, and the depth is close to zero, the evaluation 
returns a special value telling the search to continue.  But if the depth 
reaches a large negative number, the evaluation function always succeeds, 
so that the search will eventually terminate.

<H3>How to combine accuracy with importance?</H3>

So far, we've just looked at trying to find the points at which the
evaluation may be inaccurate.  But maybe we don't care if it's
inaccurate for unimportant parts of the tree, but we really do care for
nodes on the principal variation.  How do we take importance into
account when performing selective extensions?

<OL>
<LI>Don't, let alpha-beta sort out importance and just extend based on 
accuracy.

<P><LI>Extend lines that are part of (or near) 
the principal variation (e.g. singular extensions -- used in Deep Blue 
and/or its predecessors -- if there is one move much better than others in 
a position, extend the search on that move).

<P><LI>Moving away from alpha-beta...
conspiracy number search -- what is the minimum number of positions the 
value of which would have to change to force program to make a different 
move? Search those positions deeper.
</OL>

<H3>Null-move search</H3>

This idea fits in with the general theme of the lecture, adjusting search 
depth in appropriate circumstances, however it works in a different 
direction.  Instead of extending the search in hard positions, we reduce 
the search in easy positions.

<P>The idea is based on a piece of knowledge about chess: it's very rare 
(except in the endgame) for it to be a disadvantage to move.  Normally, if 
it's your turn to move, there is something you can do to make your position 
better.  Positions in which all possible moves make the position worse are 
called "zugzwang" (German for move-compulsion), and normally only happen 
in endgames.  In some other games, such as Go-Moku, zugzwang doesn't 
happen at all.  So, if you changed the rules of chess to allow a "pass" 
move, passing would usually be a mistake and the game wouldn't change much.

<P>So, suppose you have a search node that you expect to fail high
(i.e., alphabeta will return a score of at least beta).
The idea of null-move search is to search the "pass" move <I>first</I>, 
even though it's usually <I>not</I> the best move.  If the pass move fails 
high, then the true best move is also likely to fail high, and you can 
return beta right away rather than searching it.
To make this even faster, the depth at which the passing move is searched 
should be shallower than usual.

<P>You should be careful: this heuristic changes the result of the search,
and may cause you to miss some important lines of play.  You shouldn't use 
null moves twice in a row (because then your search will degenerate to 
just returning the evaluation), and you should be careful to only use it 
in situations that are unlikely to be zugzwang.  In chess, that means only 
positions with many pieces left.

<PRE>
    // alpha-beta search with null-move heuristic
    alphabeta(int depth, int alpha, int beta) {
        if (won game or depth <= 0) return score;
        make passing move;
        if (last move wasn't null && position is unlikely to be zugzwang &&
            -alphabeta(depth-3, -beta, -beta+1) >= beta)
          return beta;
        for (each possible move m) {
            make move m;
            alpha = max(alpha, -alphabeta(depth-1, -beta, -alpha);
            unmake move m;
            if (alpha >= beta) break;
        }
        return alpha;
    }
</PRE>
