	One major topic of controversy with the topic of personal freedoms 
on the internet is that of the Clipper chip.  "Clipper", you say, "wasn't 
that a TV show about a dolphin."  No, that's Flipper.  The Clipper chip 
is an algorithm for encrypting data that the government wants all user of 
the internet to utilize.  What is data encryption?  Well, that's a 
good place to start.
<P>

>Data encryption</A> is any means by which someone disguises or otherwise
makes unreadable any piece of data.  The various ways of encrypting data
are referred to as algorithms.  For instance, one alogrithm for encrypting
a message would be to shift the letters of the message by a certain
number, say three.  Hence the word "encode" would be represented by
"hqfrgh."  'H' represents 'e', 'q' represents 'n', 'f' represents 'c', and
so on--each letter shifted three forward letters.  The algorithm would
then be said to be shifting by n letters, and in this case, n is 3.  The
next question is how the receiver of the message unencrypt it.  That
person is given what is referred to as the "key."  In this case the key
would be said to be 3.  Who should have access to the key?  That is major
source of controversy surrounding the Clipper chip. <P>
	The <A
HREF="http://cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper/clipper_faq.txt">Clipper
chip</A> is the algorithm developed by the government to encrypt voice
transmissions.  Its counterpart in data encryption is Capstone, the device
that influence much of the internet.  Though people usually refer to both
of them as the Clipper chip.
	The <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/Clipper/brooks_nsa_clip-dt.testimony"
>National Security Agency</A> supports the Clipper chip quite simply so
the government will have access to it.  If everyone uses different data
encryption algorithms, the government will not be able to regulate the
internet as much as it would like to.  For instance, if a criminal is
sending information over the internet, the goverment will not be able
understand what he sending.  However with the Clipper chip, the government
would have access to encrypted files.  Without it they may still use
wiretaps, but it won't do them any good, because the data is encrypted. 
How would the government be able to read the files without allowing anyone
to do the same?  It works kind of like those locks used in schools.  Each
student knows the combination to only his lock, but the teacher has a
master key that allows access to all of the locks.  So each person using
the Clipper chip will be able to unencrypt only his own messages, while
the government will have a "master code" that will unencrypt any
transmission encrypted with the Clipper chip. <p> Most users of data
encryption are entirely opposed to the thought of the government having a
means to read <i>any</i> file they choose.  This <A
HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr25/jbde/www/matrix/clipper/clipper.time.html">opposition</A>
comes from many sources--from average people to prestigious companies:
<ul> <li>The U.S. Association for Computing Machinery's <A HREF
="ftp://furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu/security/usacm-clipper" >opposition to
the Clipper chip</A> is twofold:
	<ol> 
<li>As an encryption device it will hinder technological
development and place U.S. companies behind foreign companies that will
likely not have to adhere to national standards. 
<li>Communications
security is too important to be left to secret processes and classified
algorithms.  They must be developed openly and with full public
participation.
	</ol>
<li>The <A HREF="ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/Clipper/experts_v_clipper.letter"
>Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</A> oppose the Clipper chip 
on the grounds that:
	<ol>
<li>The government will create extensive obstacles for companies with 
intentions to incresase technology in the area of data encryption.
<li>In a formal request for comments from the Department of Commerce, very few 
replied in favor of it.  Several hundred opposed it.
	</ol>
<li>On the whole, most people oppose on the following grounds:
	<ol>
<li>It is an infringement on personal freedom to be required to use any given 
encryption method.  A person may feel he has an algorithm that is more 
effective.  If the Clipper chip becomes mandatory, he will be denied this right.
<li>It may not be a good enough algorithm.  If someone cracked it or otherwise 
got their hands on the key, they would be able to read any file encrypted with 
the Clipper chip, which would be <i>all</i> files.  That is <strong>tremendous
</strong> power.
<li>People quite simply don't want the government to have the capability to 
read <i>any</i> file any American sends.  It's a simple matter of privacy.
	</ol>  
</ol>

<h3>A few extra good resources</h3>
<P>
	The <A HREF="http://info.acm.org">ACM</A> has composed an <A HREF="
http://info.acm.org/REPORTS/ACM_CRYPTO_STUDY/_WEB/contents.html">extensive 
report</A> concerning the history of encryption, the government's right/need 
to have access to electronic inform
ation, and opposing arguments.  It's definitely worth checking out.
<p>
	The <A HREF="http://cpsr.org/dox/home.html">CPSR</A> has available a 
<A HREF="http://cpsr.org/docs/clipper.fact.sheet.html">fact sheet</A> that 
contains many issues such as flaws with the Clipper chip, why people oppose it
, and alternatives to it.

<h3>Free Speech and Censorship: Whither goeth the Internet?</h3>

<P>
	The United States has long struggled with the controversy engendered by 
its much beloved and equally maligned <A 
HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html# amendmenti>First Amendement.</a>  
Americans often embrace the f
ree speech that happens to agree with their personal inclinations, then 
angrily argue to suppress that which they don't like; this debate over 
permissable censorship has traditionally been waged in the arenas of spoken 
and printed expression.  Groups like
 the American Civil Liberties Union have long fought to safeguard our freedom 
of speech and expression, often entering the difficult realms of sexism, 
racism, agism, pornography, (to name a few); with the advent of local and 
international communication over the Internet, yet more complex problems arise.
<p>
	Recent legislation has been proposed, and some passed, to curb 
potential criminal abuse of the Internet; people fear that unlawful activity 
could easily be masked without government intervention in the form of an 
encryption device to which the government
 alone holds the key (i.e., the Clipper Chip, as described above).  Another 
major fear is that, unlike television, which can limit raunchy programming to 
late-night time slots, and pornographic video and printed materials which 
require proof of age identi
fication, the Internet is an open forum which could allow minors access to 
material  currently deemed unacceptable and less accessible.  There is also 
considerable concern that child pornography and other material deemed 
"obscene" may be passed on through
 hard-to-trace computer channels; to combat this problem, legislation has 
been introduced which would enable prosecution of any person with any contact 
whatsoever with the illegal material, even if that contact were limited to 
the material having simply passed through an individual computer.  
<p>
	While it may be initially appealing to agressively prosecute those who 
transgress our social taboos, the vast, ambiguous spectrum of "crime" is 
subject to an equally vast spectrum of interpretation.  "Obscenity" is defined 
as something that offends "community standards;" those standards change from 
community to community.   We cannot reasonably start holding people 
responsible for offending standards outside their community, i.e., 
arresting someone in Santa Fey for violating a Boise ordinance.  
<p>
	The trouble with censorship is that a little tends to go a long way: 
the same is true of surveillance. 
Censorship involves limiting or eliminating access to the object in 
question; surveillance is used to
 monitor peoples' lawful and unlawful activities (for instance, watering
one's plants or interacting with censored materials).  The legislation
currently under consideration would make anyone in <A
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Legal/obscenity_online.article>possession</a>
of obscene material susceptible to prosecution, whether or not the person
is aware that they possess the material.  While it is clearly very
important to protect children, we must be careful not to lose sight of the
whole picture; protection does not necessarily have to mean forfeiture of
all liberties.  Senator Exon, (D-Nebraska) has come up with a bill
entitled the <A HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-bill.html>
"Communications Decency Act of 1995" </a> that will have "very serious
negative ramifications for freedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet,
and all electronic networks... and would remove guarantees of privacy and
free speech on [those] networks, and may even effectively close them down
as a medium to exchange ideas and information," according to <A
HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-credits.html> slowdog and
friends</a>.  The proposed <A
HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-appendix.html>legislation</a>
would expand current FCC regulations on indecent and obscene audiotext to
cover <i>all</i> content carried over all forms of electronic
communications networks, and any network used in the transmission of
threatening, lewd, indecent, or harrassing messages would be subject to
substantial criminal liability.  The result of such severe restrictions
would force service providers into a very difficult position: fearful of
criminal prosecution, they would be compelled to either severely restrict
their subscribers' Internet activity, or worse, to shut down their
Internet access entirely.  
<p>
	This brings us to the question of surveillance, since service
providers, in order to protect themselves, would be expected to monitor
the private communication between its clients.  The threat of such
surveillance is in direct opposition to our cherished, constitutional
rights to free speech and privacy.  In response, a <A
HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-statement.html>petition</a>
is circulating against the passage of the bill, citing its constitutional
repercussions, the impracticality of the monitoring requirements, and the
economic downslide that would result from a loss of consumer confidence in
the Internet's commercial appeal.  Current law permits surveillance when
there is reasonable cause to suspect wrongdoing; why should we now unleash
Big Brother on our private, as well as public communication?
<P>
	The government's proposed Clipper Chip proposal, in addition to
Congress' attempts at anti-privacy legislation, present a dark side to the
ever-growing Internet; we must carefully weigh the issues at stake before
acting to abort the individual freedom that we so pride ourselves on.
