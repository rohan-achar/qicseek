Is the following well-known in computational geometry ?
Let P be a finite set of co-planar points. Define a linear order on P
by ordering the points in the order they are illuminated by a light 
ray sweeping out a circle centered at some point S not in P. I assume
that the ray is incident with at most one point of P at any instant.
The problem is to maximize the minimum of the angles subtended at S
by consecutive points of P. I shall call such a point S a sighting point.
There are configurations such that such a point does not exist. Also there
may be several such points for a given set P.

P is a point S from which the minimum angle subtended by two
points of P is maximized. How does one find such a sighting point ?
Is this a well-known problem of computational geometry ? It should
be. 
(* This arises from work in computing monodromy groups.*)
