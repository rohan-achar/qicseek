<h1>Streaming <i>k</i>-means on Well-Clusterable Data</h1>
<h2>Michael Shindler</h2>

<p>One of the central problems in data-analysis is <i>k</i>-means
clustering. We study the problem under the <i>streaming</i> variant,
in which we may read the input only once and must use only a small
amount of memory. Our result uses the assumption of <i>data
separability</i>, which closely reflects how <i>k</i>-means is used in
practice. We show a near-optimal streaming approximation algorithm for
<i>k</i>-means with sublinear memory and a single pass, under the data
separability assumption. Our algorithm offers significant improvements
in both space and running time over previous work while yielding
asymptotically best-possible performance.  We also show several related
results, including a method to convert any constant approximation to be
more accurate on well-clusterable data.</p>
