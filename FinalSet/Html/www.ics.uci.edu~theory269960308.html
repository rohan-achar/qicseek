<h2>8 March 1996:<br>
Fairly Recent Results about Triangulations<br>
<a href="/~rhutchin/">Brad Hutchings</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

Brad will discuss two fairly recent results about triangulations.
The first result is the Subgraph Theorem from "A Quadratic Time
Algorithm for the MinMax Triangulation" by Edelsbrunner and Tan
[<i>SIAM J. Comput.</i>, vol. 22, 1993, pp. 527-551]. The second
result is an improved beta for the beta-skeleton subgraph of the
minimum weight triangulation. This result appeared in the paper "A
better subgraph of the minimum weight triangulation" by Yang
[<i>IPL</i>, vol. 56, 1995, pp. 255-258]. 

<p>During his talk, Brad will be using his new graph algorithm
visualization application to compute and display results from these
papers on random graphs.</p>
