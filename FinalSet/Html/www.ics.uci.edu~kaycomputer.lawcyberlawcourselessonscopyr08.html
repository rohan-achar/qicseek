Lesson 9 - Copyright 8:</FONT></H3>
<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">More on &quot;Fair Uses&quot;</FONT></H1>
</CENTER><P><P>
Here are a few basic rules of thumb on when a use is fair:<P>
<OL>
<LI>If you're copying only a LITTLE BIT - for text, this generally means no more than a couple of paragraphs here or there, but it could be less if you're copying from a work that's already quite short - your use is probably FAIR.<P>
We wish we could tell you how much is &quot;a little bit,&quot; but we can't - there's no bright line. If someone tells you something like &quot;It's OK to copy 20% of a newspaper article or 10% of a scholarly article,&quot; that's a COPYRIGHT MYTH.<P>
<LI>If you're copying more than a little bit, but you're doing it for (a) SYSTEMATIC NEWS REPORTING, (b) CRITICAL COMMENTARY (whether positive or negative), or (c) PARODY, your use is probably FAIR.<P>
Note that it's not enough just to say &quot;I'm reporting the news to the list&quot; or &quot;I'm commenting on this article just by quoting it.&quot; A little test: If pretty much any copier can make the same claim of &quot;news reporting&quot; or &quot;commentary&quot; that you're making, your claim is probably too ambitious.<P>
<LI>If you're copying UNPUBLISHED work - work that the copyright owner hasn't displayed to all comers - then your use is probably NOT FAIR.<P></OL>
The classic example of unpublished work is a personal e-mail. You might get away with quoting several lines in some situations, but generally you can't.<P><P><BR>
