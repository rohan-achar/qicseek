<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The Computable Plant project is a systematic effort to advance the
understanding of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana
through imaging and computational modeling of developmental processes.
Interesting and generic problems arise within this computational approach.
 For example, to quantify the growth of the SAM and its cell lineages
requires detecting and tracking multiple features in 3D image sequences,
and finding a smoothed global velocity field due to growth; we approach
this problem through nonlinear optimization.  Also, fitting the resulting
data to dynamical models requires a flexible modeling framework for
coupled mechanical and regulatory networks.  For these problems we develop
a mathematical foundation based on the use of a ?dynamical grammar?
capable of representing discrete-time events such as cell division that
change the number of objects and their relationships, as well as
continuous-time processes arising from regulatory networks and mechanical
interactions.  The resulting algorithms are being used to assist
experimental research on mechanisms of meristem maintenance and
phyllotaxis.

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
Eric Mjolsness received an undergraduate degree from Washington University
in St. Louis in 1980 and a PhD in physics from the California Institute of
Technology in 1986. He has served on the faculties of Yale University, the
University of California San Diego, the California Institute of
Technology, and the University of California Irvine where he is currently
a member of the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics and the Computer
Science Department.  He has also served as a leading member of the Machine
Learning Systems Group at the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  His
research interests are largely connected with the construction of
scientific inference systems, using techniques from machine learning,
pattern recognition, nonlinear optimization, statistical physics and other
mathematical disciplines to further research into computational biology
and other sciences.
