<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>We study markets in which consumers are trying to hire a team of
agents to perform a complex task. Each agent in the market prices their
labor, and based on these prices, consumers hire the cheapest available
team capable of doing the job they need done. We define the cheap labor
cost in such a market as the ratio of the best Nash equilibrium of the
original market and the best possible Nash equilibrium of any of its
submarkets, where "best" is defined with respect to consumers, i.e., we
are looking at Nash equilibria in which the consumer pays the
least. This definition is motivated by a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess'_paradox">"Braess-style"
paradox</a>: in certain kinds of marketplaces, competition, in the form
of the availability of "cheap labor", can actually cause the prices paid
by consumers to go up.</p>

<p>We present tight bounds on the cheap labor cost for a variety of markets
including <i>s-t</i> path markets, matroid markets and perfect bipartite
matching markets. The differences in cheap labor cost across markets
demonstrate the complex relationship between the combinatorial structure
of the marketplace and the advantages or more precisely, disadvantages
to consumers due to competition.</p>
