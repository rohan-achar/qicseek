<title>  Inheritance </title>
<H1> Inheritance </H1>
 Goals: increase reusability, reliability and comprehensibility.
<h3> Relationships between classes</h3>
 <ul>
   <li> One class may <b> use </b> another class.
   <li> One class may  <b> contain </b> another class. (Has-a)
   <li> One class may <b> inherit </b> from another class. (is-a)
   <li> Pay attention to the relationships between classes.
 </ul>
<h3> Inheritance </h3>
<li> Old method: code copying.
<li> New method: Classes with inheritance.
<li> You can inherited methods and data.
<li> Inheritance permits minor variation and sharing.
<li> Polymorphism permits determination of which
    function to execute at run-time, decided by object type.
<li> Java supports single-inheritance, ie. you can inheritance
   hierarchy from a tree and each object is a member of only
  one tree. An argument for this is simplicity.
<li> A limited form of multiple inheritance is achieved with interfaces,
   which is the next topic.
</ul>

  <h3> Inheritance Example  </h3>
    <pre> public class NormedComplex
             extends Complex         // the inheritance 
     {
        private double norm;
        
         NormedComplex(double x, double y)
        {
           super(x,y);    // if this is not here, super() is assumed.
                          // if super() not defined, compiler error.
           norm = x*x-y*y;
        }
        NormedComplex()
        {
          this(0,0);     // No call to super() as "this" will call super.
        } 
       
        public void normalize()
        {
          setReal(getReal()/norm);            // getReal is inherited
          setComplex(getImaginary()/norm);
        }
       ....
      }

</pre>  
<h3> Shadowing/Overriding </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>  Super can be used to access data member and member functions of the
 superclass (the one which was extended). 
 <li> In the subclass, one can use the same variable name or method name
   as in the superclass.
     This <em>shadows </em> (hides) the inherited value. To get the inherited
     value use super.x. 
 <li> One can also shadow methods, which is called <em>overriding </em>.
      Again to get the inherited method, use super.method(...).
  <li> You cannot go up more than one level, by using super.super....
  <li> You can prevent shadowing/overriding by declaring the member
   to be final. It is common to declare constants to be final.
  <li> You cannot increase the accessibility in subclasses.
 </ul>


 <h3> Casting </h3>
  <ul>
   <li> Casting converts an instance of one type  to another type, via
      the prefix operator (type).
   <li> Casting can be explicit or implicit.
   <li> Examples of implicit casting:
      <ul>
         <li>  3+4.2    Here 3 is cast from integer to float.
         <li>  "sam"+3  Here 3 is cast from integer to String.
       </ul>
   <li> Implicit casting is also called upcasting or widening,
       as the object gains additional fields, usually set to
     some default value.
    <li>  Explicit casting typical narrows or removes fields, which
    is called downcasting.
    This can be dangerous as information maybe lost. For example:
       <pre>
         int i = 1000;
         byte b = (byte) i;       
      </pre>
    If you are sure of the range of variable's value, casting may not
   hurt, as in:

      <pre>
          int i  = 4;
          byte b = (int)4;
      </pre>  
       
    <li>
     A typical use of casting occurs when retrieving elements
    from some container, such as a Vector. 
    <pre>
       Vector v = new Vector();
       v.addElement(Complex c = new Complex(3,4));   // c is upcast to object
       Complex c1 = v.getElementAt(0);   // This is an error, instead use
       Complex c1 = (Complex) v.getElementAt(0);  // downcasting
    </pre>
    Notice that in Java Vectors are unsafe as Vectors (and other containers)
   only hold Objects. Without undue cost, you can't enforce a Vector
   of a particular type. Here Java is not as strongly typed as C++ is,
which would accomplish the task via templates.
   
   </ul>

  <h3> Abstract Classes </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> An <em> abstract </em> method consists of the signature followed by 
      a semicolon, e.g.  double area();
    <li> An abstract method is used to set up a promise or contract that
      every concrete subclass will implement the abstract method.
  <li> A class is <em>abstract </em>
      if it has at least one  method without an implementation or
       if it is declared abstract.
   <li> A class that contains an abstract method must be declared
       abstract.
    <li> You cannot instantiated (have an instance of) an abstract class.
     <li> Subclasses of an abstract class may be abstract.
     <li> Subclasses of a concrete class can be abstract.
     <li> If a subclass overrides all the abstract methods, then it
       can be instantiated.

  </ul>

 <h3> Polymorphism Example </h3>
<pre>
  abstract class Shape  //  can't be instantiated
  {
    double  area();  // notice prototype
    double perimeter();
  }
  class Rectangle extends Shape 
   {                            
     double length, width;
     Rectangle(double length , double width)
      { 
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
      }
     double area()
    {
      return length*width;
    }
     double perimeter()
     {
      return 2*length + 2*width;
      }
    }
  class Square extends Rectangle 
     {
        square(double side)
       {
          super(side,side);
       }
     }
 class Circle extends Shape

   {
     double radius;
     circle(double radius)
     {
       this.radius = radius;
     }
    double area()
   {
     return Math.PI*radius*radius;
   }
   double perimeter()
  {
    return Math.PI*diameter(); // you don't worry about order of declaration
  }
  double diameter()
  {
    return 2*radius;
 }
</pre>
<h3> Polymorphism Example 2 </h3>
 Suppose we have graphical objects like buttons, scrollbars,
textfields, canvas, radio buttons and the like.
<br> Suppose each is derived from a superclass class component, which
 has a paint method.
<br> Suppose each graphical object overrides the paint method, saying
 how it should be drawn on display.
 <br> Suppose we have a method update() which has a container for
all the objects on display and simple calls paint on each of them.
 <br> Notice how easy it will be to add a new graphical object.
 <br> This is how  Applet draw on the screen.
 
<h3> What have we accomplished? </h3>
 <ul>
 <li> guaranteed that all implementation of shape have area function,
    otherwise compile-time error.
 <li> allowed for uniform determination of area via polymorphism,
  e.g. we could have a vector of shapes which was a mixture of
  rectangles, squares, and circles and we could loop through them
  and determine each objects area. But remember we need to cast them
  to shape.
 </ul>


  <h3> Accessibility Rules  </h3>
 The boundaries of accessibility are determined by class, subclass
and package. If you write your code(classes) in one  directory, then the
classes are all part of the same anonymous package.
  <ul>
    <li> <em> Public </em> means accessible to anyone.
    <li> <em> Private </em> means accessible only to members of the class
   or to its inner classes.
    <li> <em> No designation </em> means package or friendly accessibility,
   ie. full visibility of methods and data to anyone in  the same package.
    <li> <em> Protected </em> means accessible to subclasses
    and to package members.
    <li>  <em> Private Protected </em> means accessible only to subclasses.
    <li> Note: when you subclass and override, you cannot increase the
         accessibility. This would lead to a compile error.
         
   </ul>
