<p>In <a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b0136s123/">
B0136/S123</a>, a 3x2 block forms a 9c/30 replicator:</p>

Replicators can cancel each other around corners, forming large
square replicator-based oscillators.

replicator-based oscillator"></a></p>

<p>With random initial conditions, this rule quickly settles down to
large regions of live cells on even generations and dead cells on odd
generations, or vice versa, with only a sparse scattering of oscillators and replicators within each
region. With an initial density of approximately 45% live cells, the
regions of both phases are equally balanced and have gradually annealing
phase boundaries; for other densities one phase or the other eventually takes over the whole space. However, the chaotic phase boundaries occasionally create new replicators which grow and interact to eventually fill space with a dense chaotic pattern in place of its initial stability.</p>
