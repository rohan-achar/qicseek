<ul>
<li><b>Course Description.</b> 
Techniques for efficient algorithm design, including divide-and-conquer 
and dynamic programming, and time and space analysis of algorithms.
Fast algorithms for problems having applications in networks, 
computer games, graphics, and scientific computing, such as sorting, 
shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, network flow, and pattern matching.
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks,
two midterms, and a comprehensive final exam. The overall grade
will be determined 20% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and
30% from the final.
Group work on homeworks is permitted, but each
student must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
Late homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>
</li>

<li><b>Exam policy.</b>
Exam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration
is allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams 
will be considered cheating.
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#cheating">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a 
failing grade in the class.
</li>

<li><b>Laptop policy.</b>
Open laptop computers are not allowed during lectures.
</li>

<li><b>Text.</b> The course text, which is required, will be 
<a href="http://www.algorithmdesign.net/">Algorithm Design</a>,
by Goodrich and Tamassia.
</li>

<li><b>Add/drop policy.</b> 
Drops will be accepted only up to the first midterm. 
Once your drop card has been
signed, further coursework from you will not be graded. After the
seventh week of classes, withdrawals will be allowed only by
petition and under documented extenuating circumstances.
