Dear Moishe,
Received your e-mail regarding the Langsam roots.  I was married to a 
Langsam descendent and have a minimal of information about them...I don't 
know if there is a connection...Louis Langsam came to the states in the 
early 1900's from Tyrawa Woloska, near Sanok in Gallacia.  He had three 
children, one of whom is still living on Long Island.  I will show him 
printouts of your very interesting web-site when I see him again at the 
end of June, and see if he recognizes any names.  My children are Louis 
Langsam's great-grandchildren and I posted with Jewishgen. to find out 
more information for them...

Hi,

We have been in contact before and you mentioned some family in Long Island. 
Can I contact "Louis' son out on the island" or one of his kids directly, to 
find out more?  I would like to get more info on your  "Louis Langsam"  
ancestry. 

Thanks!
