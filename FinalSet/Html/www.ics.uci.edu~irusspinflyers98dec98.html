<P>The Team Software Process (TSP)<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> has
been designed to help engineering teams more effectively develop software
intensive products. TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> has been used
with pure software teams and with mixed teams of hardware and software
engineers. TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> has also been used for
both new development and enhancement and with commercial and imbedded real-time
systems. The languages used have included Java, C, Jovial, C++, and special
4GLs. TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> can be used with teams of from
2 to 20 engineers developing or enhancing software-intensive systems. Its
objective is to assist the engineers in producing quality products on their
planned schedules and within their estimated costs.

<P>This talk describes TSP's<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> objectives,
the logic behind the TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> process, and
the relationships among the TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT>,</SUP> PSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP>,
and CMM <SUP>&reg;</SUP>. A growing number of organizations have used the
TSP<FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT> and this talk will describe the experiences
of several of them and provide some data on their results. Finally, the
talk briefly reviews the TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> introduction
strategy and some of the key issues involved in successfully introducing
the TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP>.

<P><B>Biography: </B>Mr. Humphrey is currently an SEI Fellow at the Software
Engineering Institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University. He joined the
SEI after his retirement from IBM in 1986. While at the SEI, he established
the Process Program, led the initial development of the Capability Maturity
Model<FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT> (CMM <SUP>&reg; </SUP>) framework for software
for institutional growth, and introduced the concepts of Software Process
Assessment and Software Capability Evaluation. The CMM<SUP> &reg; </SUP>is
now used by software organizations throughout the world to guide their
process improvement work. It has become the standard used by the U.S. Department
of Defense, the British Ministry of Defense, and many other government
departments and industrial corporations to evaluate their own capabilities
and those of their software suppliers. His most recent work is on the Personal
Software Process<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> (PSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP>)
and the Team Software Process<SUP> <FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP> (TSP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP>).

<P>Prior to joining the SEI, Mr. Humphrey spent 27 years with IBM in various
technical executive positions including the management of all IBM commercial
software development. This included the first 19 releases of OS/360. He
was also IBMs Vice President of Technical Development, responsible for
the system architecture and software development for the IBM System 370
product line. At one time, while he was IBM director of Policy Development,
he was responsible for IBMs world-wide hardware and software contracts
and competitive practices. Most recently, he was IBM's Director of Programming
Quality and Process.

<P>Mr. Humphrey holds graduate degrees in Physics from the Illinois Institute
of Technology and Business Administration from the University of Chicago.
He is an SEI Fellow, a member of the ACM, an IEEE Fellow, and a past member
of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Board of Examiners. He was
awarded the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Software
Engineering Award for 1993, and the SEI Leadership Award in 1997. His publications
include many technical papers and six books. His most recent books are:
"Managing the Software Process" (1989), "A Discipline for Software Engineering"
(1995), "Managing Technical People" (1996), and "Introduction to the Personal
Software Process" (1997). He holds five US. Patents.
