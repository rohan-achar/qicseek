<h2>
Research Biography for Walt Scacchi</h2>
Over the past 20 years, a substantial majority of Dr. Scacchi's research
centers about three interrelated categories:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#OS">Organizational Studies of Computing/Software Development</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#SF">The System Factory Project and Environments</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#SP">Organizational and Software Processes</a></li>
</ul>
He maintains an active interest and research activity in the first and
third categories, while work on the second, the System Factory Project,
occurred primarily during 1981-1990. This document highlights significant
and representative research problems and results he has developed, as well
as the concepts, techniques, and tools that gave rise to these results.
There are also citations to 25 or so publications in each category that
he has produced to document these research efforts. His research contributions
in each of the three categories have been recognized both nationally and
internationally, as is shown below. Beyond this, there are also some modest
details regarding his <a href="#Teaching">teaching</a> and <a href="#Service">service</a>
experience.
<p>Overall, Dr. Scacchi's research efforts have been focused on the question,
<i>how
do computing/software systems come to be the way they are? </i>Such a question
points to his interest in understanding how computing/software systems
are produced and consumed within different organizational settings.
<p><a NAME="OS"></a><b>Organizational Studies of Computing/Software Development
[OS]</b>
<p>Dr. Scacchi's earliest research efforts were dominated by his interest
in conducting empirical studies of how computing systems are used and evolved--that
is, consumed--in various organizational settings [OS1-OS5,OS7]. He observed,
studied and conducted interviews in a municipal government MIS shop, a
physics research laboratory, an insurance company, and a computer science
research institute. These studies focused on characterizing the attributes,
describing the processes, and identifying recurring patterns of organizational
behavior surrounding the use, maintenance or evolution of local computing
environments. Further, these characteristics, descriptions, and patterns
were grounded in the goals, relationships and constraints that participants
associated with the computing technology at hand within its organizational
context. Concomitant with these studies, he worked with his advisor, Rob
Kling, to develop new concepts that would serve as an emerging language
for analyzing and understanding instrumental computer use. Principal among
these concepts was the "computing package" [OS1,OS3,OS5], "multiple perspectives
for understanding computing in organizations" [OS4,OS5], and the "web of
computing" [OS7,OS5].
<p>The computing package refers to a recognition that a given computing
system is simultaneously embedded within multiple organizational contexts
(e.g., user community, developer setting, maintenance organization, administrative
unit invoking policies for access/use of computing resources, etc.). This
gives rise to a variety and pattern of conditions that made the instrumental
use of computing often problematic [OS3]. Therefore, to understand how
such a system is consumed, one must understand how it is embedded within
each participating context. This includes understanding what resources
are in contention, how satisfied users are with computing operations, whether
computer use is mandatory or discretionary, etc.), as well as how participants
maneuver through or around these contexts in order to get their work done.
The significance of the computing package as a contribution and new perspective
for understanding computing in organizations was highlighted at length
(2 pages) in an 8 page review of the 1979 AFIPS National Computer Conference
appearing in <i>IEEE Computer</i> 12(8):79-86, 1979. Such recognition was
particularly gratifying for him as this was the first research paper he
presented solo at a major research conference. In later studies focused
on the production of new software development technologies, he employed
the computing package concept to help reveal how it could serve as a design
heuristic and project management strategy. His goal was to development
new techniques to simplify the deployment, adoption and integration of
these new technologies in different organizational settings [OS8,OS9,OS12,OS20,OS21,OS24].
<p>Through ongoing studies of the instrumental use of computing and computing
packages in different settings, Kling and Scacchi recognized that there
were a number of alternative perspectives one could employ when trying
to understand how people use and evolve computing systems within organizations.
By 1980, they had identified six distinct analytical perspectives that
could be employed for such purposes [OS4]. In hindsight, the use of multiple
perspectives seems obvious, though at the time (1980), there were no other
research publications offering or employing such an analytical regimen.
<p>Rather than attempt to characterize each perspective, two noteworthy
points about their existence and usage can be made. First, there is no
single best perspective to use to understand computing in all settings
or situations. No one perspective guarantees a better truth than any other
does. However, people who seek to characterize or explain how a computing
systems are used and evolved (whether in good or bad ways) typically choose
only one or two perspectives to situate their analysis. This means by having
knowledge of other analytical perspectives, it becomes possible to discover
holes or blind spots in an analysis drawn from any single perspective.
Second, the multiple perspectives can be used prescriptively to anticipate
or predict characteristics, patterns or outcomes associated with the development
and deployment of new computing technologies [OS2,OS6,OS10,OS13,OS16].
Clearly, prescriptive use is meant to provide a framework for understanding
and investigating models/theories that can be empirically substantiated
or refuted. Such insights might then favorably influence the production
or development of new computing systems in ways that increases the likelihood
of their successful use and constructive evolution. For example, Kristen
Nygaard (an original developer of Simula-67 programming language) was sufficiently
influenced by the analytical power of multiple perspectives that he and
his colleagues introduced language constructs for describing perspectives
into the programming language Beta in the 1980s. This was an attempt to
support the modeling and interpretation of different perspectives. This
in turn could facilitate and encourage the work oriented design of computing
systems for their users. Thus, multiple analytical perspectives can be
employed to describe/model and analyze how computing systems fit into the
work patterns and processes of their users.
<p>The web of computing was a concept developed by Kling and Scacchi to
combine the computing package and multiple analytical perspectives to more
succinctly account for the organizational patterns and work processes that
we were observing in our respective field studies. By this time (1980-1981),
they came to find that the configuration of hardware and software resources
in an organization, together with the organizational policies governing
their use and maintenance were inextricably intertwined with the way people
used computing in their work. Computing technology was thus a form of social
organization at work [OS7]. Changing (or "innovating") the computing technology
at hand within an organization would therefore precipitate change or innovation
in the social organization of work for the participants [O5]. This web
of computing perspective could thus act as an combination or unification
of multiple perspectives for understanding how different kinds of computing
systems are consumed in different organizational settings [OS5,OS7]. Dr.
Scacchi would later employ this result in understanding and managing the
production and use of new software development tools and techniques, as
described later. Overall, the web of computing emerged as a dominant perspective
within an international community of researchers for analyzing and explaining
empirically or theoretically derived research results for how computing
fits into or shapes the tempo, place and processes of work in complex organizations.
Dozens of papers have employed or cited the web of computing paper [OS7].
For example, work by Curtis and others at the MCC Software Technology Program
acknowledged that the web of computing played a central role in their conception
of how to understand software design processes using multiple levels of
analysis (cf. B. Curtis, H. Krasner, and N. Iscoe, <i>"</i>A Field Study
of Software Design Processes for Large Systems<i>", Comunications ACM</i>,
31(11), 1268-1287, 1988). Beyond this, one can also find references to
use of the Web of Computing paper (as of 1998) listed in academic course
syllabi found on the World Wide Web through a common search engine. Last,
a recent paper by Wanda Orlikowski and Suzanne Iacono, "Desperately Seeking
the "IT" in IT Research: A Call to Theorizing the IT Artifact", <i>Information
Systems Research, </i>12(2), June 2001, makes frequent reference to the
Web of Computing paper and analytical framework. Orlikowski and Iacono,
after reviewing the collection of papers published in the past 10 years
in this prestigious journal, call for a new research agenda for the Information
Systems community that explores and builds on concepts such as those attributed
to the Web of Computing, as developed by Kling and Scacchi. Thus, the Web
of Computing continues to be one of the most influential in the area of
organizational studies of computing and information systems, some 20 years
after its original publication.
<p>Part of Dr. Scacchi's collaborative contribution to the development
of the web of computing as an analytical approach lie in his research into
understanding the process of innovation in computing [OS5]. Simply stated,
one way to understand how computing/software systems are used, maintained
or evolve is to empirically examine the processes associated with how such
systems change over time within their organizational setting. This work
also marked his initial foray into the study of the formal and informal
processes people engage when they change or innovate their computing environment.
This focus on these processes in general, and those associated specifically
with the production of software tools and applications have since become
a central category of his research in the last 10 years. In addition, his
focus on innovation process later evolved to include studies of software
system development (i.e., producing new software innovations) [OS6], software
maintenance (i.e., incremental software innovation) [OS11,OS14] and software
technology transfer processes and barriers [OS17,OS24].
<p>Other accomplishments in Dr. Scacchi's organizational studies of computing/software
systems draw upon the preceding results, but now focus primarily on examining
the different aspects of system production. This move represented his attempt
to broaden the scope of organizational studies of computing/software systems
to include understanding how complex systems are developed, and whether
they can be developed in a manner that constructively exploits an awareness
of the computing package, multiple analytical perspectives, and the web
of computing. He originated and introduced over a dozen novel strategies/heuristics
for how software development projects could be more effectively and efficiently
managed to produce successful systems [OS8,OS9,OS12,OS20,OS21]. In general
terms, these strategies focus on understanding and managing the computing
package/web, the structure and flow of work processes and teamwork [OS19],
innovation processes, and handling problems and breakdowns [SP5]. For example,
he suggested explicitly mapping/modeling the computing package associated
with a software system being developed for a local user base. Later, he
suggested how the web of computing associated with a new software system
could be described or modeled as a configuration of resources. These resources
("objects") and their configurations ("resource architectures" or webs)
can model how systems are produced, used or consumed ("relations") by people
("agents") using computing systems ("tools") and artifacts ("documents")
in the course of their work ("tasks" and "processes") [SF/E12,SF/E18,SP1-SP4].
Finally, through a comparative secondary analysis of more than a dozen
empirical studies of what affects the productivity of software development
organizations/projects, he found some independent support for his strategies,
but no contradictory evidence for their refutation [OS18,OS23].
<p>Overall, Dr. Scacchi's most successful and recognized organizational
studies of computing/software development include those papers addressing
the computing package [O3], multiple analytical perspectives [O4], web
of computing [O7], organizational dynamics of software maintenance work
[O14], and organizational characteristics, processes and behavioral patterns
that affect software development productivity [O23]. Citations and links
to selected papers in this category can be found in his <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wscacchi/Pubs-OrgStudies.html">Research
Publications on Organizational Studies of Computing/Software Development</a><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/C%7C/Walt%27s%20Stuff/WS/Pubs-OrgStudies.html">.</a>
<p><a NAME="SF"></a><b>The System Factory Project and Environments [SF]</b>
<p>After completing his early studies on the use and evolution of computing
systems, Dr. Scacchi decided to turn to look upstream to see if he could
apply a similar approach and concepts to understand how computer/software
systems were (or could be) developed. The System Factory Project he originated
at USC in 1981 marked his first effort in this category. Given the opportunity
to teach the graduate software engineering course at USC, he found on the
first class meeting that he was facing an eager group of 50 or so M.S.
and Ph.D. Computer Science students who wanted to learn about large-scale
software engineering. He recognized this as an opportunity to create and
enact a novel, large software development organization in which every student
would have a role as contributing software engineering and project participant.
Such a project would itself be situated within a complex organization setting
employing shared access to limited resources, budget and schedule constraints,
and a usual assortment of unexpected circumstances that arise in any setting
given enough time. He also saw this as an informal experiment in the rapid
development of a large software system. As such, he adopted and refined
a software development life cycle approach (a process) based on then current
software engineering techniques. He also developed a single system architecture
for a "software engineering environment" (SEE) which could be factored
into 6-10 separate components (stand-alone software tools) and integrated
through some common file I/O capabilities.
<p>Within 15 weeks start to finish, he had 8 teams of 4-7 students each
develop, demonstrate, and deliver a prototype version of the tool they
had agreed to produce. Teams were organized and managed according to a
set of project management strategies that were described earlier. All teams
produced a series of documents corresponding to the requirements, specification,
architecture design, detailed design, source code, test plan and selected
results, user manual and maintenance guide. The initial SEE represented
some 3000 pages of printed computer based documentation and about 30,000
source lines of Pascal code. Basically, a large majority of the Project
participants considered this initial experiment a success, a valuable learning
experience, and something they could take with them (i.e., each student
completing their team's project received an electronic copy of all the
other teams' components and documentation). In short, this initial investigation
suggested that something interested could be observed, learned and shared
through a large-scale participatory project with a common set of goals.
Dr. Scacchi then went on to repeat, refine and expand Project iterations
a total of 11 times through 1988, involving more than 600 M.S. and Ph.D.
CS students (about 1.5% of <i>all</i> such students in the U.S. according
to figures in the ACM/Taulbee survey) during this period. Five of the Project
development cycle iterations were extended to 30 week schedules over nine
month academic school year. In total more than 600K lines of source code
were delivered, and between 30K to 50K pages of online documentation were
produced through this cyclic, evolutionary approach to software system
development. Though not noted earlier, one of the main results from his
study of the process of innovation in computing [O5] was that once embedded
in an organizational setting, computing innovations will continuously arise
and be incorporated into local systems and their embedding organization.
Said another way, once people in an organization uses computing systems
routinely, they will continuously innovate these systems as long as the
organization thrives. The SF Project repeatedly produced this kind of finding
as well.
<p>Much has been written about the concepts, management strategies, development
techniques and focal software components and composite environments, as
can be found in the Research Publications below. The majority of these
research results follow from the concepts and research from his organizational
studies of computer/software development. Descriptions of the SF Project's
objectives, strategies, SEE architecture and so forth can be found in a
number of publications [SF7,SF9,SF15,SF17,SF23]. Noteworthy among these
is the Keynote Address on the SF Project he gave at the Japan Software
Engineering National Conference in Tokyo in 1988 [SF15], which was also
invited for presentation at the CMU Software Engineering Institute's annual
conference on Software Engineering Education [SF17]. Subsequently, the
directors of the SEI's Graduate SE Education Division later identified
the USC SF Project as one of the top six exemplary approaches for how to
experience software engineering within graduate course work (see G.A. Ford
and N.E. Gibbs, "A Masters in Software Engineering Curriculum", <i>Computer</i>,
22(9):59-71, 1989). Finally, the last publication in this segment [SF23]
describes the final state of organizational development (i.e., accommodate
multiple development teams geographically distributed but interlinked via
the Internet) and SEE architecture that was realized in the SF Project
when its production was brought to an end.
<p>The resulting software components and composed SEEs produced in the
SF Project were also successful in their respective technical arenas. In
particular, pioneering and significant contributions were realized in the
development of language based SEEs supporting hardware-software co-production
[SF1-SF5], maintaining software architectural designs and source configurations
[SF6,SF10,SF11,SF14,SF19,SF20,SF24], and hypertext environments for managing
software project documentation [SF12-SF14,SF16,SF18,SF22,SF24-SF26]. Later
versions of the SF software technologies were distributed or licensed to
various corporate research sponsors and other academic research groups
as well.
<p>Beyond these published results, Dr. Scacchi took the opportunity to
give more than 50 invited presentations, academic colloquia, industrial
seminars, keynote addresses, and other conference presentations on the
SF project in both national and international venues. Audiences throughout
the U.S., Canada, Japan, Europe (England, Finland, France, Germany, and
Italy) and South America (Columbia) read about, listen to, and engaged
in questions and discussions to learn more about what was accomplished
in the SF Project and how.
<p>Overall, the SF Project achieved its many of its objectives as a novel
experiment in applying emerging principles from organization studies of
computing/software development to the production of software systems. The
Project participants collectively produced one of the largest sets of software
component tools and composed environments that can be found within any
academic setting during the 1980's. It served as a venue that combined
educational course work, software development and a research experience
that created or enhanced career opportunities for its participants through
their hard work, the Project's&nbsp; publications and international visibility.
It also supported the completion of seven doctoral dissertations under
his supervision as well. In addition, companies such as AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories
set up their own SF-like projects (the software factory laboratory in North
Carolina). Accordingly, further details regarding this project can be found
in the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wscacchi/Pubs-SF.html">Research
Publications on the System Factory Project and Environments.</a>
<p><a NAME="SP"></a><b>Organizational and Software Processes [SP]</b>
<p>The third and final category within Dr. Scacchi's research efforts concentrate
and build on the results from the preceding two categories. The focus of
his research here is directed at understanding organizational processes,
software development/use processes, and their interplay. What is novel
and unique is his use of a computationally based `web of computing' framework
and support environment. As before, his research efforts were influenced
by empirical and technology development studies in collaboration with external
organizations that serve as field sites or testbed.
<p>A good deal of Dr. Scacchi's research effort during 1985-1995 focuses
on developing a computational (software) environment that would support
the modeling, analyzing and simulating of organizational and software processes.
This software environment was called the Articulator [SP4]. It was developed
as a vehicle for describing and understanding work processes, resource
configurations and surrounding organizational circumstances from a web
of computing perspective [SP18]. Much like the development of computer
based statistical packages enabled quantitative analyses of questionnaire
and similar empirical data, the Articulator was designed to facilitate
the qualitative analysis of the structure and dynamic behaviors of complex
processes. Emphasis within the Articulator was directed at capturing, representing
and operationalizing organizational and software processes that could be
described primarily using normative, ordinal or interval--i.e., qualitative--data.
The Articulator was a breakthrough in that it provided a new class of analytical
instrumentation and computational testbed that enabled more robust, computationally
tractable and comprehensive analysis than was previously available by the
late 1980's. Prior to this time, qualitative studies of organizational
or software processes within any discipline were typically limited to describing
or representing processes using (a) narrative text or semi-structured hypertext
renderings [SF18,SF22,SP15], or (b) procedural or object-oriented programming
models or (c) quantitative data and statistical analysis. Text and hypertext
descriptions offer the potential for rich, highly contextual descriptions
of processes, but "tools" for analysis of large narrative text data sets
are usually left to the mind of the analyst/reader. Programming models,
while well suited for specifying methodical calculations and detailed computations,
are not well suited for describing the work situations or organizational
software ecology [OS23] in which software processes were occurring. Quantitative
data and statistical tools can be used to readily characterize the frequency,
distribution or discrete snapshots of opinions, conditions, events or other
circumstances using descriptive or inferential statistical measures. However,
the organizational context, structure (configuration of resources, control
relationships and division of work), and behavioral flow of processes (what
gets done, by who, when, where, how and why, what goes wrong, etc.) over
time cannot be easily described or modeled using quantitative data or statistical
analysis [OS28]. Examples below to show this.
<p>In a study he directed for Northrop-Grumman B-2 Division in 1990-1993,
Dr. Scacchi had the opportunity to investigate, model and analyze the software
development life cycle processes responsible for producing the multi-million
lines of code for the Avionics Flight Control software for the B-2 strategic
bomber. This B-2 software organization had over 700 software developers
and managers working in this effort. It was also said at the time to be
44 months behind schedule and $150M over budget. Furthermore, new schedules
slips were recurring, as were multi-million dollar/month development cost
overruns. After a collaborative three month empirical study using multi-round
interviews, progress briefings, refinement and participatory validations
of&nbsp; Articulator based models by B-2 software personnel, Dr. Scacchi's
research team had discovered more than 30 systemic problems ("black holes")
and structural conflicts ("miracles") in their development life cycle.
These dilemmas made following the current software development process
logically and physically impossible. Their analysis and empirical findings
provided a foundation for how to restructure the Division's web of computing
and reorganize their processes, resources and workflow to resolve the dilemmas.
Subsequently, they were then able to reduce their schedule slips and cost
overruns leading to a multi-million dollar savings in cost avoidance. In
turn, the project sponsors tripled his research funding, scope and duration
of this study in acknowledge the significance of these results. Finally,
one publication describing how Dr. Scacchi's team modeled, represented
and analyzed this software development life cycle process using the Articulator
received (in 1997) an international "citation for excellence with the highest
quality rating" for original research in the field of Information Systems,
from ANBAR Management Intelligence (a European Management Research Rating
Service). Furthermore, this publication appears in ANBAR's number 1 rated
IS research journal (in 1996) in Europe, <i>Decision Support Systems</i>.
<p>In a pilot study he directed for U.S.West (the telco) in 1993-94, Dr.
Scacchi's research team empirically captured, modeled and refined a software
development life cycle process to support 1500 software developers coordinated
more than 400 tasks. Through modeling and analysis using the Articulator
environment, he discovered the process we captured had 18 levels of process
decomposition and project management. The findings were that such a work
structure, management coordination hierarchy, and division of labor would
be too complex, impractical and unmanageable. Though USWest choose not
to heed this advice, the software project that employed this life cycle
process eventually failed and reported a loss of over $200M [SP28].
<p>In addition to these two studies, the Articulator environment has been
employed in descriptive or prescriptive studies of&nbsp; dozens of software
development processes at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, BellCore, Hewlett-Packard
and elsewhere, as well as within the System Factory Project [SP1-SP4,SP7,SP16,SP18].
The Articulator environment also possessed a unique capability (during
the early 1990's) to be able to diagnose and suggest repairs for software
development processes that had broken down or failed during their enactment
[SP5,SP6,SP12]. As before, this novel capability to support "articulation
work" was derived from empirical studies of software development work processes
[cf. SP6,OS14,OS19,OS26]. More recently, the Articulator environment has
been applied in studies of organizational and software use/evolution processes
found in other settings. These include corporate financial operations at
McKesson Corp. [SP20], supply chain management and order fulfillment for
EDS [SP13,SP24], military procurement for the Naval Air Warfare Center,
feature film production for USC Entertainment Technology Center and its
sponsors (e.g., LucasFilms Ltd.), Tele-medicine for the USC Advanced Biotechnology
Consortium and others. Finally, recent (Internet or Web based) technologies
and techniques derived from the Articulator have been, or are being used
in new studies organizational and software processes. These studies address
organizational and software processes associated with: research grants
management at the Office of Naval Research [SP19,SP22], organizational
transformation [SP22,SP29], software systems acquisition [SP23], distributed
multi-site virtual enterprises for software development [SP17,SP21,SP27],
Electronic Commerce applications [SP25,SP26,OS27], and the redesign of
software processes [SP28].
<p>How did the Articulator environment help in analyzing these organizational
and software development processes? As a process is being captured via
interviews, elicitation, artifact review or participant observation, it
can be incrementally modeled and analyzed with the Articulator for its
consistency, completeness and internal correctness. An emerging "process
model" can also be queried about explicit or implicit relationships within
the model that follow from the web of computing perspective [SP4]. Similarly
such a model could be used as a testbed for experimentation or operationalization
through knowledge-based simulation of process dynamics under different
hypothetical or empirically grounded scenarios [SP4]. This use of knowledge-based
simulation techniques was unique within the software process research community
for many years [SP28]. Overall, these analytical capabilities were developed,
applied and refined over a number of years through projects noted above.
However, the development and use of the Articulator was not limited to
only the modeling, analysis and simulation of complex processes.
<p>The Articulator was also designed to serve as a unifying framework to
support and coordinate software development processes, tools, information
artifacts/products, and other resources within an operational web of computing.
Dr. Scacchi recognized, as his early organizational studies indicate, that
the "integration" of computing resources with people at work in a complex
setting was a recurring source of problems with computing use [OS3,OS5,OS7].
Accordingly, he directed the design the Articulator environment around
its use of an extensible modeling ontology (or process meta-model) [SP18].
This way his team or others could use the Articulator to model arbitrary
organizational or technological systems as process models that could then
be interlinked or webbed together. With such a capability, his research
team was among the first to successfully demonstrate the integration of
a legacy, pre-existing software engineering suite of tools and development
techniques so as to follow, support and enact a modeled set of software
development and project management processes [SP8,SP10,SP16]. This in turn
enabled his research team to integrate the Articulator with six other software
environment architectural styles [SP11,SP20] and a dozen or so software
development/process repositories [SP9,SP15,SP17]. The ability to integrate
diverse environments, repositories, and processes using a common (process
meta-model) scheme was later characterized as a new class of environment
called, "meta-environment" [SP11]. Thus, the Articulator was able to demonstrate
and embody the unique result for how the organizational analysis of computing/software
development could be integrated into the practice of software engineering
through a meta-environment technology based on the web of computing framework.
Through additional research effort, this capability evolved into what is
now called, "process life cycle engineering" [SP20,SP22,SP24].
<p>Overall, Dr. Scacchi's research in this category is perhaps his most
successful and significant. Five of his research publications (four journals
articles, one ICSE paper) in this area have been reprinted in books, which
is an indicator of its significance. Furthermore, the ability to take this
approach into new organizational and software processes continues to demonstrate
that the previous twenty years of his research continues to converge and
build on prior results and empirical studies. As such, further information
of this research can be found in his <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wscacchi/Pubs-Process.html">Research
Publications on Organizational and Software Processes.</a>
