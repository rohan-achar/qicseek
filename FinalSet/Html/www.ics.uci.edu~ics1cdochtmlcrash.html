<h1>Crash course on writing documents for the Web</h1>

<hr>

<i>I wrote this to help people in PC Week Labs to write
documents for our web server. It's designed for someone who wants to
put a page on the web but could care less about most of the technical
details. I hope it's helpful. <p>
<b>One warning:</b> This document is in continual revision mode. You
are looking at a draft version that gets changed frequently whenever I
have a spare moment or two. If you see any technical inaccuracies,
misspellings, or typos, please be forgiving. Thanks.</i><p>

If all that you want to do is convert an existing column or story into
a Web document, there's only a few things that you need to do.<p>
<ol>
  <li> Convert the document to plain text.
  <li> At the top of the file, type "&lt;title&gt;" and then type the
       title of the document. End the title with "&lt;/title&gt;".
  <li> At the beginning of the headline, type "&lt;h1&gt;" and at the
       end type "&lt;/h1&gt;".
  <li> If there is any deck (the secondary headline just below the
       main head), surround it with "&lt;h2&gt;" and
       "&lt;/h2&gt;"
  <li> If there are any subheads in the story itself, surround the
       text of the subhead with "&lt;h3&gt;" and "&lt;/h3&gt;"
  <li> In front of each paragraph (not including the headings that you
       have marked already), type "&lt;p&gt;"
  <li> If there is a byline, type "&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;" in front of it
       and type "&lt;/i&gt;" after it.
</ol>

That's it, you're finished. This quick-and-dirty list glosses over
numerous complications and technicalities, but at least your document
will be read and displayed correctly by most browsers. <p>

However, if you want to do anything at all fancy, such as links to
other documents, graphics, bullet or number lists, or whatever, then
read on. This document isn't long and you'll be able to do a lot more
when you're finished working through it. Let me know if there are any
confusing sections so I can improve it.<p>

<hr>

<a name="what_html"><h3>What is HTML?</h3></a>

The Hypertext Markup Language (or HTML) is the language used to create
the documents for the World Wide Web. Although most browsers will
display any document that is written in plain text, there are
advantages that you get by writing documents using HTML. When HTML
documents are read by applications specifically designed for the Web
(usually called browsers or Web browsers) they can include 
formatting, graphics, and even links to other documents. <p>

As a markup language, HTML is not so much concerned about the
appearance of the documents, but about the structure of a
document. Rich Text Format (RTF), on the other hand, is an example of
a formatting language. The difference between them is that, in HTML,
you would use commands to mark the headings, normal paragraphs, lists
(and whether they are numbered or not), and even things like
addresses. In RTF, you would use commands (usually the word processing
program does this for you) to indicate the typeface, font size, and
style of the text in a document. <p>

Although HTML is a variant of Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML), it differs from some other SGML variants in its
simplicity. HTML is simple enough to just type in directly without
using some sort of HTML editor. HTML editors are useful, especially if
you have massive quantities of documents to write, but they are not
necessary to get started.<p>

One thing to remember about HTML, though, is that it is a new
standard that's constantly changing. It's difficult to define HTML
exactly, which is why you often see use of the word "usually" in this
document. Also, browsers differ in their support of various HTML
extensions and differ (usually a lot) in the way they handle many
standard HTML constructs. However, by sticking to the fairly simple subset of
the commands outlined in this document, you can be reasonably assured
that your documents will look good in just about any Web
browser. <p>

In general, HTML commands begin with a &lt; and end with a &gt;. The
commands are almost never case sensitive and are usually "containers"
(although there are numerous exceptions to both of those
generalizations). By a container, I mean that there is usually a
beginning command and an ending command. The commands would thus be
applied to the text in-between the beginning and ending commands. An
example of a container command is the title command, which surrounds
the text that is designated as the document's title with &lt;title&gt;
and &lt;/title&gt;. <p>

White space, meaning anything that is not a printable character, is
generally ignored in HTML. Leaving a blank line in your document will
generally not create a blank line when the document is displayed in a
browser. <p>

Finally, not every element common to typical documents is included in
HTML. You will occasionally have problems converting
some documents. For example, the version of HTML in common use today
doesn't support tables or equations. There are a few tricks you can
use (which we will go into later) to get around these
limitations. Both tables and equations are part of the next proposed
version of HTML, but it will likely be some time before the new
version of HTML is supported by most browsers. <p>

<a name="philosophy"><h3>A quick word about the HTML
philosophy</h3></a>

Using a markup language is a lot like using styles in Word. In Word,
for example, you would often have styles for the various heading
levels, bullet lists, and other common elements of a document. The
advantage of this is that you can change the underlying formatting
easily without having to reapply the formatting throughout the
document. <p>

However, as an author of a Web-based document, you don't control the
actual formatting of your document. So what's the advantage? The
advantage is that, with everybody using the same "styles" so-to-speak,
the World Wide Web has a certain consistency to it that is absent from
many other forms of information access on the Internet. This
consistency is all the more impressive when you consider that there is
no one, central design authority controlling the content of the
Web. <p>

Sometimes you see documents on the Web in which authors have gone to
extraordinary effort to make it look exactly the way they wanted it
to. They use lots of in-line graphics (for things like bullets,
horizontal rules, and even individual characters). Usually, however,
the result is that those pages look terrific in one particular browser
but look dreadful in others. <p>

I suggest that you try to use the Web's built-in "style-sheet" rather
than trying to devise your own. On good, configurable browsers, the
users can then see documents the way they want to, not the way the
author wants them to.<p>

<hr>

<a name="the_heading"><h3>The Heading</h3></a>

Every HTML document should start by declaring itself as such. You do
that with the &lt;html&gt; command at the very top of the document.
The very last text in a document should be the ending command,
&lt;/html&gt;.<p>

The top part of the document should also have a section for heading
information which is surrounded by the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;
commands. There are several items of information that you can put in
the header, but almost all of it is totally ignored by most browsers
out there. One piece of information you should <i>always</i> have in
the heading is the title. The title (as we mentioned earlier) is
surrounded by the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; commands. <p>

The title of a document is not normally displayed as part of the page,
but is often displayed in some sort of special section in most
browsers (Mosaic puts the title in a Document Title box just under
it's menu, for example). However, the title is also used by most
browsers when saving the user's "hotlist," so it should be both
descriptive and short enough to fit comfortably on one line.<p>

Finally, the "body" of the document should also be marked off with the
&lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; commands. This is the part of the
document that is normally displayed as the page in most browsers.<p>

This is what a typical document would look like so far:<p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;This is my title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;



&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

(Remember that white space doesn't matter, so this stuff could all be
on one line if you wanted. It makes no difference.)<p>
<hr>

<a name="the_body"><h3>The Body</h3></a>

<a name="heading_levels"><h4>Heading levels</h4></a>

HTML is easiest to use with documents with a fairly rigid structure --
ones with a definite outline of headings, subheadings,
sub-sub-headings, and lists. It is not required, but it is good
practice to write your document so that the heading "levels" used
reflect the organization of your document. For example, the first
heading should be a "level 1" heading (I'll show you how to do this
soon), subheadings should be "level 2," and so on.<p>

Most browsers recognize at least four heading levels. There is support
in HTML for more than that, but what I mean by "recognize" is that the
browser gives up to four levels of headings a distinct style. After
the fourth level, it gets difficult to tell the heading levels
apart. If you get much beyond that, you should consider breaking up
your document into multiple pages. <p>

The heading commands look like &lt;hX&gt; and &lt;/hX&gt;, where X is
the heading level. In most documents on the Web, the first heading is
a duplicate of the document's title. Our typical document would look
like this after we added the first heading:<p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;This is my title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is my title&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

<a name="paragraphs"><h4>Paragraphs</h4></a>

Normal paragraphs are separated with the &lt;p&gt; command. This is
one of those exceptional commands that is not a container, although it
can be. The next proposed version of HTML makes this a container, so
that paragraphs begin with a &lt;p&gt; and end with a &lt;/p&gt;.
However, very few documents actually use the &lt;p&gt; command this
way, so it's up to you if you want to use it.<p>

Our sample document would look like this after we added a paragraph or
two and a subheading:<p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;This is my title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is my title&lt;/h1&gt;

This is a sample paragraph. The majority of most documents contain
this type of construct. &lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is a subheading&lt;/h&gt;

The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.
The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.&lt;p&gt;

The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.
The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

I put the paragraph marks after each paragraph in this example, but
they can just as easily go in front of each paragraph. The &lt;p&gt;
is just a separator. <p>

<a name="lists"><h4>Lists</h4></a>

There are three kinds of lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and a
special kind called a definition list. The ordered lists are numbered.
Unordered ones typically just use bullets to mark each item.<p>

In ordered lists the browsers take care of inserting the actual
numbers. This behavior is convenient for authors because if you
insert or delete items in a sorted list, you don't have to worry about
renumbering everything. An ordered list begins with
&lt;ol&gt; and ends with &lt;/ol&gt;.<p>

Unordered lists typically use bullets to mark off each item in the
list, but this is up to the browser (a DOS browser may use asterixes
or dashes, for example). An unordered list begins with &lt;ul&gt; and
ends with &lt;/ul&gt;.<p>

In both kinds of lists, the individual items are designated with a
&lt;li&gt; command. This is another one of those commands that isn't
typically used as a container (i.e. it doesn't have a corresponding
&lt;/li&gt; command), but it can have one if you want. The new
proposed version of HTML uses it as a container, but since virtually
all web documents don't use it that way, you're pretty much assured
that it will always be recognized as a separator (the same goes with
&lt;p&gt;, by the way). <p>

Although it is not strictly legal HTML, you can nest lists to get an
outline effect. All current browsers that I'm aware off recognize
nested lists and it is likely to be added to the standard.<p>

Here's our sample document with a few lists thrown  in:<p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;This is my title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is my title&lt;/h1&gt;

This is a sample paragraph. The majority of most documents contain
this type of construct. &lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is a subheading&lt;/h&gt;

The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.
The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.&lt;p&gt;

Here's an ordered list:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; first item.
  &lt;li&gt; second item.
  &lt;li&gt; notice that &lt;p&gt; commands are not necessary to
             separate list items.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Here's an unordered list:&lt;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; an item.
  &lt;li&gt; another item.
  &lt;li&gt; here's a nested list
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; a nested item
      &lt;li&gt; another nested item
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; the last item
&lt;/ul&gt;

The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.
The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

This is what the list above would look like when rendered with your
browser:<p>

Here's an ordered list:<p>
<ol>
  <li> first item.
  <li> second item.
  <li> notice that &lt;p&gt; commands are not necessary to separate
       list items.
</ol>

Here's an unordered list:<p>
<ul>
  <li> first item.
  <li> another item.
  <li> Here's a nested list
       <ul>
	 <li> a nested item
	 <li> another nested item
       </ul>
  <li> the last item
</ul>

<a name="deflists"><h4>Definition Lists</h4></a>

A definition list is a very flexible type of list that is more useful
than its name implies. We used definition lists extensively on our own
pages (including the <a
href="http://www.ziff.com/~pcweek/">Welcome</a> page). It's useful for
lists where a bit of explanatory text should accompany each item. Each
item in the list has two parts, a term (indicated with the &lt;dt&gt;
command) and a definition (which uses the &lt;dd&gt; command). The
list itself is started with a &lt;dl&gt; command and closed with a
&lt;/dl&gt; command. <p>

Here's a sample definition list:<p>

<pre>
&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt; First Term
  &lt;dd&gt; First term's definition.
  &lt;dt&gt; Second term (or title, or whatever)
  &lt;dd&gt; Text that explains or expands on the second term.
&lt;/dl&gt;
</pre>

And This is what it would look like in your browser:<p>

<dl>
  <dt> First Term
  <dd> First term's definition.
  <dt> Second term (or title, or whatever)
  <dd> Text that explains or expands on the second term.
</dl>

<hr>

<a name="links"><h3>Links</h3></a>

Links are what make Web documents unique. Unfortunately, some of what
is required to create a link is slightly complicated. The most complex
part of it is the URL that points to the resource you're linking to.<p>

<a name="urls"><h4>URLs</h4></a>

A URL (or Universal Resource Link or Label or something like that) is
the address of a document or resource. It usually takes this form:<p>

<i>protocol</i>://<i>machine.name</i>[:port]/<i>directory</i>/<i>document.name</i><p>

The <i>protocol</i> is the Internet protocol used to reach the
document or resource. On the Web, it is typically "http", but it can
be any of numerous other things (such as ftp, gopher, telnet, etc).
The <i>machine.name</i> is just what you think it is: the name of the
host where the document resides (such as
<i>www.pcweek.ziff.com/~pcweek</i>). The ":port" portion of the address is
optional and is only necessary when a resource is accessible through a
non-standard TCP port number. The standard port number for HTTP is 80,
for example, which is why we have to put in the port number for our
web server (8001) since we don't use the standard port. This goes for
other protocols, as well. If you want to reach a gopher at something
than port 70 or telnet at something other than port 23, you have to
put in a port number.<p>

The <i>directory</i> and <i>document.name</i> components of the URL
are self explanatory. <p>

The easiest way to get the URL of a document is to find it using
Mosaic or Cello and then copy the URL into your HTML document. In
Mosaic, you would copy the text in the Document URL field near the top
of Mosaic's window. In Cello, you would click on the link with your
right mouse button and choose the "copy" command. <p>

<a name="putting_links"><h4>Putting Links in HTML documents</h4></a>

The HTML command for putting a link into a document takes this form:<p>

&lt;a href="URL">text of link&lt;/a&gt;<p>

You put the URL in the quotes following the "href=" and put the text
of the link (the part that users will click or select to activate the
link) after the &gt; and before the &lt;/a&gt;.<p>

So, here's out document with a few links:<p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;This is my title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is my title&lt;/h1&gt;

This is a sample paragraph. The majority of most documents contain
this type of construct. Here's a link embedded in the document right
&lt;a href="http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~pcweek/whats_new.html"&gt;here
&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is a subheading&lt;/h&gt;

The quick brown fox &lt;a
href="http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~pcweek/jumped.html&gt;jumped&lt;/a&gt;
over the slow lazy dogs.
The quick brown fox jumped over the slow lazy dogs.&lt;p&gt;

...and so on...
</pre>

<a name="images"><h3>Images</h3></a>

One of the great things about the web is the ability to create and
share some snazzy looking documents across platforms. However, you
should restrain yourself somewhat. I've noticed in our log files for
our server than many people turn off in-line images to increase
performance. Even with fast network access to the Internet, some users
find documents loaded down with images to be annoying.<p>

However, a dash of colorful images can be nice. Images are also often
necessary to make a point that can't be made using text only.<p>

To add an image to your document, you need to convert it first into
GIF format. There are a number of tools for doing that, so I won't get
into that here, but if you can't find something or need help, see me. <p>

To make things easier on yourself, put the images that you want to
show in your document into the same directory as your document. It is
possible to display a GIF images that is stored almost anywhere (even
somewhere on the Internet), but I won't get into those kinds of
complexities right now. <p>

The HTML command for inserting an image at the current position takes
the following form:<p>

&lt;IMG SRC="/name_of_image.gif"&gt;<p>

That's all there is to it to insert a GIF file into your document.
Notice that the location is given <i>relative</i> to the current
document. The location does not have to be a full URL (but it can be
if you want). This same trick can be used for normal links (not just
for images). Some say it's faster to use relative URLs, but I've never
really noticed a great difference in speed, but I've somehow or
another got used to using relative URLs for images and full URLs for
everything else. Feel free to disagree with
me here. <p>

<a name="image_options"><h4>Image Options</h4></a>

There is also one optional argument to the IMG command that you may
want to use occasionally. <p>

You can "suggest" to the browser that the
image be aligned in a particular way with the surrounding text using
the "align=" directive. The choices are "top", "middle", or "bottom",
which indicate where the base of the image should be in relation to
the base line of the surrounding text.<p>

Here's a couple of examples:<p>
<pre>
&lt;img align="top" src="./image.gif"&gt; Some Text.
&lt;img align="middle" src"./image.gif"&gt; Some Text.
&lt;img align="bottom" src"./image.gif"&gt; Some Text.
</pre>

Here's how it would look in your browser:<p>
<img align="top" src="/~eamonn/icons/arw01rt.gif"> Some Text.<p>
<img align="middle" src="/~eamonn/icons/arw01rt.gif"> Some Text.<p>
<img align="bottom" src="/~eamonn/icons/arw01rt.gif"> Some Text.<p>

Another useful option is to suggest a text-only alternative for
browsers that don't support in-line images. The "alt" directive is
used like this:<p>

<pre>
&lt;img alt="o" src="./image.gif"&gt; Some Text.
&lt;img alt="o" src"./image.gif"&gt; Some Text.
&lt;img alt="o" src"./image.gif"&gt; Some Text.
</pre>

For users on a text-only browser like W3-mode of Emacs or Lynx, these
items would appear as just "o" instead of something like [IMAGE]. Some
web servers make very good use of this directive to display icons for
the image-oriented and simple word links (like "[Home] [Next]") for
text-only browsers.<p>

This document should get you started. To learn more remember to
<b>steal, steal, steal</b>. That is, use the built-in "view source"
option built-in to most browsers to view the HTML commands that make
up some of your favorite pages on the web. I'm not advocating that you
out-right steal documents, but study the formatting commands that are
used and try to use the same tricks in your own documents.<p>
