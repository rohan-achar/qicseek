Here is Fagnano's theorem:

Suppose P and Q are points on a quadrant AB of an ellipse, and the normals at
P and Q are the same distance from the center of the ellipse.  Then the
difference in length of the arcs AP and BQ is also that distance.

What is unusual about this, from the point of view of a classical geometer?
