We went there several times this trip even though it was not the closest playground.  Someone at the park told us there are similar structures at another park on Meadow, on the other side of Middlefield, but we didn't get there this time.<h5>Taken Wednesday, January 01, 2003, 02:00:35pm.&nbsp; Original image size: 2048x3072, 6.4Mb<br>Technical details: Canon EOS D60, 1/1000s @ F8.0, ISO 100, 15mm/F2.8 (24mm equiv)<br>FVU DEC +1, Daylight, PS7 Levels G 0:1.05:255, USM 20:20 - 50:1, D60ISOR 400 low</h5></div></body></html>
