<h1>ICS 163, Spring 2006:<br>
Graph Algorithms</h1>

<hr>
<h2>General Course Information</h2>

<p>Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final exam. Group work on homeworks is permitted;
each student should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks.
The course texts will be <i>Network Flows</i> (Ahuja, Magnanti, and
Orlin) and <i>Graph Drawing</i> (Di Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and
Tollis). The course meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:30 - 1:50 in
ICF 103.</p>

<p>The final grade will be formed by combining the numerical scores from
the homeworks (20%), midterm (35%), and final (45%).</p>

<p>The TA is <a href="mailto:johnsonm@uci.edu">Matt Johnson</a>, with office
hours Mondays 1:00-2:00 and Wednesdays 12:00-1:00 in CS/E 338. There is also a reader, <a
href="mailto:kxu@ics.uci.edu">Kebin Xu</a>.</p>

<p>Homework solutions will be posted to the <a
href="http://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/noteboard/?board=4141">class noteboard
on EEE</a>.
