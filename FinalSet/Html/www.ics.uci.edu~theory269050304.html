<p>Abstract:
Property testing deals with a relaxation of decision problems where
one must determine whether an input belongs to a particular set,
called property, or is far from it. For example, for a boolean formula
&phi; on <i>n</i> variables, the associated property <i>P<sub>&phi;</sub></i> is a
collection of <i>n</i>-bit strings that satisfy &phi;. The authors prove that
there are 3CNF properties (properties for boolean formulae in 3CNF
form) that require a linear number of queries, even for adaptive
tests. In contrast, it is known that 2CNF properties can be tested
with <i>O(sqrt(n))</i> queries. I will briefly indroduce property testing
and present the proof of hardness of 3CNF properties testing.
