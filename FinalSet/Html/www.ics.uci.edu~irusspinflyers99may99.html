<p>
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was developed by Rational Software 
Corporation as an integration of Booch, OMT (Rumbaugh et al.), and 
OOSE (Jacobson) notations. UML was adopted as the Object Management 
Group's (OMG) standard notation for representing systems, including 
software and business systems. 

<p>

UML provides notations to describe the component (class and object) 
structure of a system, the behavior of system components (using 
use-case, communication sequence and state diagrams), and the 
deployment of software components. UML also provides a formal 
specification language, which can be used to describe constraints, 
and an activity diagram, which can be used to describe processes.

<p>
This presentation will describe UML using examples and outline its 
use in object-oriented software development.

<strong>Biography: </strong>
Ed Colbert has taught and consulted on Ada, object-oriented methods, 
and software engineering since 1982. He created the Colbert 
Object-Oriented Software Development method (OOSD), which supports 
languages such as Ada, C++, and SmallTalk. NASA Langley Research Center
recently used OOSD for a Software Engineering Process Guide, available 
on the Web at sw-eng.LaRC.NASA.gov/guidebook/. Ed is currently 
consulting on applying UML to projects with TRW and others. Ed is the 
chair of the ACM SIGAda Patterns Working Group. He has delivered 
presentations and tutorials at OOPSLA, Object Expo, LOOK, OOP, SCOOP, 
Tri-Ada and Ada UK. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan 
(M.S. Computer and Communications Sciences and BS Honors in Chemistry 
and Biology).
