<h1>Sorting</h1>

How to alphabetize a list of words? Sort a list of numbers? Some
other information? We saw last time one reason for doing this (so
we can apply binary search) and the same problem comes up over and
over again in programming. 

<h2>Comparison sorting</h2>

This is a very abstract model of sorting. We assume we are given a
list of objects to sort, and that there is some particular order in
which they should be sorted. What is the minimum amount of
information we can get away with and still be able to sort them? 

<p>As a particular case of the sorting problem, we should be able
to sort lists of two objects. But this is the same as comparing any
two objects, to determine which comes first in the sorted order.
(For now, we assume no two objects are equal, so one should always
go before the other; most sorting algorithms can also handle
objects that are "the same" but it complicates the problem.)</p>

<p>Algorithms that sort a list based only on comparisons of pairs
(and not using other information about what is being sorted, for
instance arithmetic on numbers) are called <i>comparison sorting
algorithms</i></p>

<p>Why do we care about this abstract and restrictive model of
sorting?</p>

<ul>
<li>We only have to write one routine to do sorting, that can be
used over and over again without having to rewrite it and re-debug
it for each new sorting problem you need to solve.</li>

<li>In fact we don't even have to write that one routine, it is
provided in the <tt>qsort()</tt> routine in the Unix library.</li>

<li>For some problems, it is not obvious how to do anything other
than comparisons. (I gave an example from my own research, on a
geometric problem of <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-parallel-qt.html">quadtree
construction</a>, which involved comparing points (represented as
pairs of coordinates) by computing bitwise exclusive ors of the
coordinates, comparing those numbers, and using the result to
determine which coordinates to compare).</li>

<li>It's easier to design and analyze algorithms without having to
think about unnecessary problem-specific details</li>

<li>Some comparison sorting algorithms work quite well, so there is
not so much need to do something else.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sorting algorithms</h2>

There are dozens of sorting algorithms. Baase covers around seven.
We'll probably have time only for four: heapsort, merge sort,
quicksort, and bucket sort. Each of these is useful as an
algorithm, but also helps introduce some new ideas: 

<ul>
<li>Heapsort shows how one can start with a slow algorithm
(selection sort) and by adding some simple data structures
transform it into a much better one.</li>

<li>Merge sort and quick sort are different examples of divide and
conquer, a very general algorithm design technique in which one
partitions an input into parts, solves the parts recursively, then
recombines the subproblem solutions into one overall solution. The
two differ in how they do the partition and recombination; merge
sort allows any partition, but the result of the recursive solution
to the parts is two interleaved sorted lists, which we must combine
into one in a somewhat complicated way. Quick sort instead does a
more complicated partition so that one subproblem contains all
objects less than some value, and the other contains all objects
greater than that value, but then the recombination stage is
trivial (just concatenate).</li>

<li>Quick sort is an example of randomization and average case
analysis.</li>

<li>Bucket sort shows how abstraction is not always a good idea --
we can derive improved sorting algorithms for both numbers and
alphabetical words by looking more carefully at the details of the
objects being sorted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sorting time bounds</h2>

What sort of time bounds should we expect? First, how should we
measure time? If we have a comparison sorting algorithm, we can't
really say how many machine instructions it will take, because it
will vary depending on how complicated the comparisons are. Since
the comparisons usually end up dominating the overall time bound,
we'll measure time in terms of the number of comparisons made. 

<p>Sorting algorithms have a range of time bounds, but for some
reason there are two typical time bounds for comparison sorting:
mergesort, heapsort, and (the average case of) quicksort all take
O(n log n), while insertion sort, selection sort, and the worst
case of quicksort all take O(n^2). As we'll see, O(n log n) is the
best you could hope to achieve, while O(n^2) is the worst -- it
describes the amount of time taken by an algorithm that performs
every possible comparison it could.</p>

<p>O(n log n) is significantly faster than O(n^2):</p>

<pre>
    n       n log n         n^2
    --      -------         ---
    10      33              100
    100     665             10K
    1000    10^4            10^6
    10^6    2 10^7          10^12
    10^9    3 10^10         10^18
</pre>

So even if you're sorting small lists it pays to use a good
algorithm such as quicksort instead of a poor one like bubblesort.
You don't even have the excuse that bubblesort is easier, since to
get a decent sorting algorithm in a program you merely have to call
<tt>qsort</tt>. 

<h2>Lower bounds</h2>

A lower bound is a mathematical argument saying you can't hope to
go faster than a certain amount. More precisely, every algorithm
within a certain model of computation has a running time at least
that amount. (This is usually proved for worst case running times
but you could also do the same sort of thing for average case or
best case if you want to.) This doesn't necessarily mean faster
algorithms are completely impossible, but only that if you want to
go faster, you can't stick with the abstract model, you have to
look more carefully at the problem. So the linear time bound we'll
see later for bucketsort won't contradict the n log n lower bounds
we'll prove now. 

<p>Lower bounds are useful for two reasons: First, they give you
some idea of how good an algorithm you could expect to find (so you
know if there is room for further optimization). Second, if your
lower bound is slower than the amount of time you want to actually
spend solving a problem, the lower bound tells you that you'll have
to break the assumptions of the model of computation somehow.</p>

<p>We'll prove lower bounds for sorting in terms of the number of
comparisons. Suppose you have a sorting algorithm that only
examines the data by making comparisons between pairs of objects
(and doesn't use any random numbers; the model we describe can be
extended to deal with randomized algorithms but it gets more
complicated). We assume that we have some particular comparison
sorting algorithm A, but that we don't know anything more about how
it runs. Using that assumption, we'll prove that the worst case
time for A has to be at least a certain amount, but since the only
assumption we make on A is that it's a comparison sorting
algorithm, this fact will be true for all such algorithms.</p>

<h2>Decision trees</h2>

Given a comparison sorting algorithm A, and some particular number
n, we draw a tree corresponding to the different sequences of
comparisons A might make on an input of length n. 

<p>If the first comparison the algorithm makes is between the
objects at positions a and b, then it will make the same comparison
no matter what other list of the same length is input, because in
the comparison model we do not have any other information than n so
far on which to make a decision.</p>

<p>Then, for all lists in which a&lt;b, the second comparison will
always be the same, but the algorithm might do something different
if the result of the first comparison is that a&gt;b.</p>

<p>So we can draw a tree, in which each node represents the
positions involved at some comparison, and each path in the tree
describes the sequence of comparisons and their results from a
particular run of the algorithm. Each node will have two children,
representing the possible behaviors of the program depending on the
result of the comparison at that node. Here is an example for
n=3.</p>

<pre>
                  1:2
                /     \
             &lt; /     &gt; \
              /         \
           2:3           1:3
           / \           / \
        &lt; / &gt; \       &lt; / &gt; \
         /     \       /     \
      1,2,3    1:3  2,1,3    2:3
               / \           / \
            &lt; / &gt; \       &lt; / &gt; \
             /     \       /     \
          1,3,2   3,1,2 2,3,1   3,2,1
</pre>

This tree describes an algorithm in which the first comparison is
always between the first and second positions in the list (this
information is denoted by the "1:2" at the root of the tree). If
the object in position one is less than the object in position two,
the next comparison will always be between the second and third
positions in the list (the "2:3" at the root of the left subtree).
If the second is less than the third, we can deduce that the input
is already sorted, and we write "1,2,3" to denote the permutation
of the input that causes it to be sorted. But if the second is
greater than the third, there still remain two possible
permutations to be distinguished between, so we make a third
comparison "1:3", and so on. 

<p>Any comparison sorting algorithm can always be put in this form,
since the comparison it chooses to make at any point in time can
only depend on the answers to previously asked comparisons. And
conversely, a tree like this can be used as a sorting algorithm:
for any given list, follow a path in the tree to determine which
comparisons to be made and which permutation of the input gives a
sorted order. This is a reasonable way to represent algorithms for
sorting very small lists (such as the case n=3 above) but for
larger values of n it works better to use pseudo-code. However this
tree is also useful for discovering various properties of our
original algorithm A.</p>

<ul>
<li>The worst case number of comparisons made by algorithm A is
just the longest path in the tree.</li>

<li>One can also determine the average case number of comparisons
made, but this is more complicated.</li>

<li>At each leaf in the tree, no more comparisons to be made --
therefore we know what the sorted order is. Each possible sorted
order corresponds to a permutation, so there are at least n!
leaves. (There might be more if for instance we have a stupid
algorithm that tests whether a&lt;c even after it has already
discovered that a&lt;b and b&lt;c).</li>
</ul>

<h2>The sorting lower bound</h2>

What is longest path in binary tree with k leaves? At least log k.
(Proof: one of the two subtrees has at least half the leaves so
LP(k) &gt;= 1 + LP(k/2); the result follows by induction.) 

<p><a name="omega">So the number of comparisons to sort is at least
log n!. This turns out to be roughly n log n; to distinguish lower
bounds from upper bounds we write them a little differently, with a
big Omega rather than a big O, so we write this lower bound as
Omega(n log n).</a> More precisely,</p>

<pre>
    log n! = n log n - O(n).
</pre>

A reasonably simple proof follows: 

<pre>
        n
    n! = product i
       i=1
</pre>

so 

<pre>
          n
    log n! = sum log i
         i=1

          n
       = sum log (n i/n)
         i=1

          n
       = sum (log n - log n/i)
         i=1

            n
       = n log n - sum log n/i .
               i=1
</pre>

Let f(n) be the last term above, sum log(n/i); then we can write
down a recurrence bounding f(n): 

<pre>
        n
    f(n) = sum log n/i
       i=1

       n/2             n
    f(n) = sum log n/i +  sum  log n/i
       i=1          i=n/2+1
</pre>

All of the terms in the first sum are equal to log 2((n/2)/i) = 1 +
log((n/2)/i), and all of the terms in the second sum are logs of
numbers between 1 and 2, and so are themselves numbers between 0
and 1. So we can simplify this equation to 

<pre>
        n/2
    f(n) &lt;= n + sum log (n/2)/i
        i=1

     = n + f(n/2)
</pre>

which solves to 2n and completes the proof that log n! &gt;= n log
n - 2n. 

<p>(Note: in class I got this argument slightly wrong and lost a
factor of two in the recurrence for f(n).) We can get a slightly
more accurate formula from Sterling's formula (which I won't
prove):</p>

<pre>
    n! ~ sqrt(pi/n) (n/e)^n
</pre>

so 

<pre>
    log n! ~ n log n - 1.4427 n - 1/2 log n + .826
</pre>

Let's compute a couple examples to see how accurate this is: 

<pre>
        log n!          formula gives
    n=10    21.8            33.22 - 14.43 ~ 18.8
    n=100   524.8           664.4 - 144.3 ~ 520.1
</pre>

Enough math, let's do some actual algorithms. 

<h2>Selection sort</h2>

To understand heap sort, let's start with selection sort. An
experiment: I write a list of numbers, once I'm done you tell me
sorted order. 

<pre>
    5,2,100,19,22,7
</pre>

How did you go about finding them? You probably looked through the
list for the first number, then looked through it again for the
next one, etc. One way of formalizing this process is called <i>
selection sort</i>: 

<pre>
    selection sort(list L)
    {
    list X = empty
    while L nonempty
    {
        remove smallest element of L
        and add it to X
    }
    }
</pre>

Time analysis: there is one loop, executed n times. But the total
time is not O(n). Remember we are counting comparisons. "Remove the
smallest element of L" could take many comparisons. We need to look
more carefully at this part of the loop. (The other part, adding an
element to X, also depends on how we store X, but can be done in
constant time for most reasonable implementations and in any case
doesn't require any comparisons, which is what we're counting.) 

<p>The obvious method of finding (and removing) the smallest
element: scan L and keep track of the smallest object. So this
produces a nested inner loop, time = O(length of L) so total time =
O(sum i) = O(n^2). This is one of the slow algorithms. In fact it
is as slow as possible: it always makes every possible comparison.
Why am I describing it when there are so many better
algorithms?</p>

<h2>Heap sort</h2>

Heap sort (invented by <a href="people.html">J.R.J. Williams</a>)
looks exactly like the pseudo-code above for selection sort, and
simply uses some data structures to perform the main step of
selection sort more quickly. 

<p>The operations we need to perform are</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting with a list L and turning it into a copy of whatever
data structure we're using,</li>

<li>Finding the smallest object in the data structure, and</li>

<li>Removing the smallest element</li>
</ul>

There are many suitable data structures, for instance the AVL trees
studied in ICS 23. We'll describe here a structure called a <i>
binary heap</i>. A heap also supports other possible operations,
such as adding objects to the list; that's not useful in this
algorithm but maybe later. (We will see heaps again when we talk
about minimum spanning trees and shortest paths.) 

<p>Simple analysis of heap sort: if we can build a data structure
from our list in time X and finding and removing the smallest
object takes time Y then the total time will be O(X + nY). In our
case X will be O(n) and Y will be O(log n) so total time will be
O(n + n log n) = O(n log n)</p>

<h2>Heap data structure</h2>

We form a binary tree with certain properties: 

<ul>
<li>The elements of L are placed on the nodes of the tree; each
node holds one element and each element is placed on one node.</li>

<li>The tree is <i>balanced</i> which as far as I'm concerned means
that all paths have length O(log n); Baase uses a stronger property
in which no two paths to a leaf differ in length by more than one.
<a name="heapprop"></a></li>

<li>(The <i>heap property</i>): If one node is a parent of another,
the value at the parent is always smaller than the value at the
child.</li>
</ul>

You can think of the heap property as being similar to a property
of family trees -- a parent's birthday is always earlier than his
or her childrens' birthdays. As another example, in a corporate
hierarchy, the salary of a boss is (almost) always bigger than that
of his or her underlings. 

<p>You can find the smallest heap element by looking at root of the
tree (e.g. the boss of whole company has the biggest salary); this
is easy to see, since any node in a tree has a smaller value than
all its descendants (by transitivity).</p>

<p>How to remove it? Say the company boss quits. How do we fill his
place? We have promote somebody. To satisfy the heap property, that
will have to be the person with the biggest salary, but that must
be one of his two direct underlings (the one of the two with the
bigger salary). Promoting this person then leaves a vacancy lower
down that we can fill the same sort of way, and so on. In
pseudo-code:</p>

<pre>
    remove_node(node x):
    {
    if (x is a leaf) delete it
    else if (no right child or left &lt; right)
    {
        move value at left child to x
        remove_node(left child)
    }
    else if (no left child or right &lt; left)
    {
        move value at right child to x
        remove_node(right child)
    }
    }
</pre>

(Baase has a more complicated procedure since she wants to maintain
a stronger balanced tree property. Essentially the idea is to pick
someone at the bottom of the tree to be the new root, notice that
that violates the heap property, and trade that value with its best
child until it no longer causes a violation. This results in twice
as many comparisons but has some technical advantages in terms of
being able to store the heap in the same space as the sorted list
you're constructing.) 

<p>The number of comparison steps in this operation is then just
the length of the longest path in the tree, O(log n).</p>

<p>This fits into the comparison sorting framework because the only
information we use to determine who should be promoted is to
compare pairs of objects..</p>

<p>The total number of comparisons in heapsort is then O(n log n) +
how much time it takes to set up the heap.</p>

<h2>How to build heap?</h2>

I ran out of time, we'll have to see this <a href="960118.html">
next time</a>.
