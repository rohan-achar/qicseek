<H2> Abstract </H2>

This paper presents a Petri net model for concurrent programs that
is based on an internal representation for concurrent programs
called <i>task interaction graphs</i> (TIGs).  Comparisons are
made between these TIG-based Petri nets and an existing Petri net
model for Ada tasking.
