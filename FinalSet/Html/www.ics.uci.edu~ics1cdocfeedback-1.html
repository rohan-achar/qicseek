<P>By 23 January, you and all members of your team are expected to be 
able to do all the things outlined below.  We will start formally
checking this no later than 23 January.  Our main focus the week of
17-20 January will be helping people with these tasks, but if time
in Labs allows, we may be able to start formal checking of mastery
toward the end of this week.

<P>A copy of these instructions is being mailed to you.
You will also be given a printed copy in lab.

<P>After setting up your ea.oac.uci.edu login as described in the next
paragraph, "Export" a copy of what has been mailed to you from the
e-mail system to a file named "Lab.1" in the special "ics.1c"
directory created by following these instructions.  (This means
that the name of the file when viewed from your home directory will be
"ics.1c/Lab.1")  As you work through the Lab Exercises described below,
update this file with your own notes about doing things.

<P>Set up your ea.oac.uci.edu login for the ICS 1C class by getting to the
"ea>" prompt (quit the EA-menu system if you are in it) and typing
<PRE>
    source ~ics1c/class.setup
</PRE>
This will create a directory ("folder" in Mac-speak) named "ics.1c"
in your home/login directory and set some configuration files.
Now follow the instructions given on the screen about the
Window Manager Configuration:

<UL>
  <LI>You will get the new ICS 1C setup automatically next time you log in.
  This one time only, though, to switch to
  the new ICS 1C Window Manager Configuration:
    <UL>
    <LI>Position the mouse on the background screen.
      Holding down the right button, drag the mouse down the
      right half of the menu until you come to "TWM Operations," and
      then select "Source .twmrc" from the menu that appears.

  <DT><B>World-Wide Web via Mosaic</B>
    <DD>You should be able to handle (and understand) all the buttons
    along the bottom of the X Mosaic Document View window, except
    "Save As ..."  and the following items from the menus along the top:
    <UL>
      <LI>File: everything except Open Local, Save As, and Print;
      <LI>Options: everything except Reload Config;
      <LI>Navigate: everything with special attention to Hotlist
	Start building (and editing) your own hotlist with choices
	such as the following:
        <UL>
	  <LI><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A>

          http://galaxy.einet.net/</A>
	</UL>
      <LI>Annotate: Skip all of this for now;
      <LI>Help: Skip "Mail Developers" but be sure to explore at least
	the first level or 2 of all the other options.
    </UL>
    The most important things here are (1) to become familiar with 
    the various options, (2) to start building your own personal hotlist,
    and (3) to be able to use the "Open..." fluently.
    (Note that you MUST POSITION THE MOUSE INSIDE type-in windows such as
    "Open Document" and "Edit Hotlist" use.  You can left-click the mouse
    or use the arrows to reposition the cursor, but (BEWARE) the Delete
    key on the keyboard deletes to the RIGHT of where the cursor is within
    the window.  So to edit strings in type-in windows, one typically
    MUST use a left-button click or arrow keys to position the cursor
    to the LEFT of where the deletion/insertion is to be made.)
