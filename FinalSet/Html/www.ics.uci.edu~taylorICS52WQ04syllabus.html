It is probably a useful book to    have, but it is *not* required for the class. In other words, you can go    ahead and buy used copies of the text that do not include the book on testing.  Make sure you get the 6th edition though.    <li>The class notes will (usually) be available on the WWW after the class    meeting in which they are used. Occasionally the notes will be available    ahead of    time,        but they might be from the previous year's offerings, and thus minor differences     may exist as compared to what's used in class this year.</ul><HR><a name="schedule"></a><H1> Schedule (<em><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">Subject to change)</font></em></H1><P><CENTER>  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>    <TR>       <td width="44"><b>Week </b>       <TD width="90"><b>Date </b>      <TD width="138"><b>Lecture topic </b>      <TD width="105"><b>Schedule items </b>      <TD width="126"><b>Assignments </b>      <TD width="236"> <Strong> Readings</STRONG> (all from Sommerville, unless         noted otherwise)    <TR>       <td width="44">1       <TD width="90"> January 13      <TD width="138"> <a href="ICS52FQ04-01.pdf">Introduction</a>             <TD width="105">&nbsp;       <TD width="126">&nbsp;       <TD bgcolor="#9999FF" width="236">Chapter 1.
