<P>Wolf, Jim.  FTC seeks new powers to ensure Web privacy, LA Times, </P>
<P>12 Oct 00, C8 (Reuters)(R)</P>

<P>Federal Trade Commission Chairman, Robert Pitofsky, gave the private sector an A- for recent efforts, but he gave them an overall grade of only C+ for "proteching customers' online privacy.</P>

<P>"... urged Congress to give his agency new powers to ensure compliance with four 'fair information practices': </P>
<B><P>notice, choice, access, and security</B>."</P>

<P>"FTC-proposed legislation would require Web sites </P>
<P>to provide clear <B>notice</B> of their information practices and </P>
<P>offer consumers <B>choices</B> on how their personal information is used beyond that for which it was provided."</P>

<P>"The FTC also favors offering consumers <B>access</B> to the data a Web site has collected about them, including an opportunity to correct mistakes or delete data.  Finally, it would mandate steps to protect the <B>security</B> of data gathered online."</P>

<P>"Self-regulation is essential, but it will be most effective if it's backed by the rule of law...."  Pitofsky to House subcommittee</P>
