Collusion in Auctions for Digital Goods
<br>
Presented by Matthew Nguyen
</h2>
<p>
Abstract: 
Auctions for digital goods are auctions where the auctioneer has an
unlimited supply of a single commodity.  In this auction framework, we
consider a bidder model where each participant has a probability p of
joining a collective colluding group.  We show that any auction that is
B-competitive without colluders, is B/(1-p)<sup>2</sup>-competitive in the presence
of colluders no matter the colluding strategy.
<p>
This is joint work with Sandy Irani, Gwendoline Shu-Hsien Chien, and
Matthew Nguyen.
