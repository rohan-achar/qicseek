<H1><A HREF="index.html">Replicators</A>: B25/S4</H1>

Like the one in <A HREF="b2s13.html">B2/S13</A>,
this replicator copies itself every three generations
on a one-dimensional 3-unit grid.
However, the replicator is asymmetric.

<P>When started from a single copy, adjacent replicators will always meet
head-to-head or tail-to-tail, but the replication action still works
if they are set up to meet head-to-tail.

<P>B25/S4 has several interesting
<A HREF="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b25s4/">known spaceships</A>,
including small c/2 orthogonal and c/8 diagonal ships.
