</CENTER><P><P>
As we've seen,<P>
<OL>
<LI>copies of small excerpts tend to be FAIR,<P>
<LI>copies for systematic news reporting, criticism, or parody tend to be FAIR, and<P>
<LI>copies of unpublished works tend to be UNFAIR.<P>
*Outside* the area covered by these three basic rules, there are two more:<P></OL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>COMMERCIAL copying is generally UNFAIR. &quot;Commercial&quot; here just means copying that makes the copier money.<P>
It doesn't much matter (A) whether you're making money from subscribers or advertisers, (B) whether you're a for-profit organization or a non-profit-one, and (C) whether your ultimate goal is the betterment of mankind or just making a quick buck. If you're making money from the copying, you should probably ask the copyright owner for a license (which might mean having to pay him for it).<P>
NONCOMMERCIAL copying is generally fair UNLESS the text you're copying is available for money (or for free in a place that carries advertising) either online or offline.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
The test is: If this noncommercial copying became WIDESPREAD, would it *displace some sales* (or some advertising revenues)? If it will, it's unfair.<P>
That's why it's a copyright infringement for you to send a copy of WordPerfect to a friend. Even if you're pretty sure your friend would never buy it himself, WordPerfect loses some money when this sort of copying becomes commonplace.<P><P>
