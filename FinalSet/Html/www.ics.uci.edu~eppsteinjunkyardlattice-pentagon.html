&gt; &gt; If n&gt;=3 it is always possible to find d such that there exists a
&gt; &gt; regular polygon with n sides in R^d such that all of its vertices have
&gt; &gt; integer coordinates (lattice polygon) with respect to the standard
&gt; &gt; lattice of R^d ?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think this is possible for n = 5, since the
&gt; ratio between the distances between non-neighbours
&gt; and between neighbours is (1+sqrt(5))/2, while the
&gt; ratio between two distances in the lattice has the
&gt; form sqrt(r) with r rational.

Nice argument.  But it looks like n=5 is impossible even for non-integer 
lattices in R^d: the intersection of the lattice with the plane containing 
the pentagon would have to itself be a planar lattice, but no planar 
lattice can contain the vertices of a regular pentagon, for if one had 
vertices abcde (say, in clockwise order) then (a+d-e) (b+e-a) (c+a-b) 
(d+b-c) (e+c-d) would be the vertices of a smaller pentagon, ad infinitum.
