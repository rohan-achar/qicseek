<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due by the beginning of
your discussion section on Wednesday, October 22.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B>  You will use Microsoft Excel
to build two spreadsheets:  one to compile simple baseball statistics (but
you don&#39;t have to know anything about baseball) and another to produce
invoices for a picture framing service.  The key to this assignment is reading
the specifications very closely and carefully to extract every bit of necessary
information.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Introduction to spreadsheets:  </B>You
will be using the spreadsheet program Excel, part of the Microsoft Office
suite of programs.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>A spreadsheet program is a visual calculator,
laid out in rows and columns like the paper spreadsheets that accountants
once used, before they had computers.  The first spreadsheet program, in
1979, was called VisiCalc.  It ran on the Apple II, and more than any other
program it was responsible for the wide use of personal computers today.
 Before VisiCalc, people used personal computers mainly for word processing
and for games; VisiCalc opened up a such a wide range of new uses for computers
(in forecasting, finance, planning, record-keeping, and so on) that sales
of personal computers soared.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>A spreadsheet is a big page filled with boxes.
 The columns are labeled with letters (A, B, C, and so on) and the rows
with numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).  The box in the upper left hand corner is called
A1, since it is on the intersection of column A and row 1.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Each box on the spreadsheet can contain a
number, like 98.7, or a label, like </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">Tax
Return</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.  This is called the <I>value</I>
of the box.  Each box can also contain a <I>formula</I>, such as =A1+B1
(all formulas in Excel start with an equals sign).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Normally you see the box&#39;s value when
you examine the spreadsheet on the computer, whether or not there&#39;s
a formula there too.  But if a box does contain a formula, the value of
that box is <I>calculated </I> from the formula.  For instance, if box C3
contains the formula =A1*B1, then the spreadsheet looks up the values in
boxes A1 and B1, multiplies them together, and displays the result as the
value of C3.  If you later change the value of A1 or B1, the spreadsheet
automatically figures out (and displays) the new value for C3.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This automatic updating feature is the key
to spreadsheets&#39; utility.  For instance, you can set up all the formulas
for paying taxes and then play around with various numbers, letting the
spreadsheet calculate how much tax is due under each scenario.  In a similar
way, you can set up a spreadsheet to do financial forecasting, keep bowling
averages, or model the population of goldfish and dragonflies in your ornamental
pond.  In the case of our picture framing service, you can set up an invoice,
then change the matting material&#39;s cost and see immediately its effect
on the total amount due.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>In fact, spreadsheets are to numbers what
word processing programs are to text:  Once the spreadsheet is set up, its
user can make whatever changes he or she needs without having to respecify
the formulas or calculations, or retype any of the other, unchanged data.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>First spreadsheet (baseball statistics):
 </B>You are the new manager of the California Angels baseball team, and
you want to keep a spreadsheet to record a player's batting statistics.
 Completing this assignment shouldn&#39;t require any knowledge about baseball
beyond what appears in this document, but feel free to ask your TA or send
mail to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="mailto:ics10a@uci.edu">ics10a@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
for clarification of any details.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part 1:</B>  First, set up a spreadsheet
that looks like this (with your own name in the appropriate place, of course):</FONT></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Picture_127.gif" WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=121 ALT="">
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Cell A1 is a label, containing the player&#39;s
name; Cell A8 is a label containing your name as the manager.  Cells A2
through A7 are also labels; they correspond with the values you will enter
in B2 through B6.  B2 is the number of times the player came up to bat (i.e.,
took a turn to hit the ball) so far this season.  B3 through B6 show how
many singles, doubles, triples, and home runs the player made (i.e., how
far around the bases the player got each time he hit the ball safely). 
C1, D1, and D3 are also labels.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>B7 and E3 should contain formulas.  B7 is
the total of B3 through B6, and E3 is the player's average for the year
(the total number of hits divided by the number of at-bats).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Now, create a page header to give this spreadsheet
the title &quot;Baseball Statistics -- Part 1.&quot;  (Check the on-line
help to find out how to do this.)  Save this spreadsheet (showing the player's
total hits and batting average) in a file called </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">part1.xls</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part 2:  </B>Now, you'll modify your spreadsheet
to keep track of the player's &quot;slugging percentage.&quot;  That's like
the batting average, except that a double counts for two hits, a triple
for three hits, and a home run for four hits.  Change your spreadsheet to
include the &quot;Total Bases&quot; (that&#39;s the weighted total of the
hits) and the slugging percentage:</FONT></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Picture_112.gif" WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=122 ALT="">
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>D5 and D6 are labels.  E5 should contain a
formula that figures out the number of total bases, as described above.
 E6 should calculate the slugging percentage, which is the number of total
bases (from E5) divided by the at-bats (B2).  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Now change the page header of your spreadsheet
to read &quot;Baseball Statistics -- Part 2&quot;, save a copy of this spreadsheet
with the name </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">part2.xls</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,
and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part 3:  </B>If the player has a hitting
streak and hits a lot of triples, the slugging percentage will go up.  Increase
the number of triples until the slugging percentage is over 2.00.  How many
triples do you have to hit to get to a slugging percentage of 2.00?  Save
the spreadsheet that shows this number as a file with the name </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">part3.xls</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part 4 (optional):</B>  After you produce
your spreadsheets to turn in, you might try to experiment with these items:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* To make your spreadsheet more readable,
vary the widths of the columns, move the cells around, change the type styles
or other formatting (always remembering that the soul of good design is
restraint--just because a dozen different type styles are available doesn&#39;t
mean that the document is improved by using all of them together), or add
graphics.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Try to rearrange all the player's information
onto one horizontal line; then add further lines for other players, and
add statistical totals for each column.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Modify the page header to include your name,
the date, and a page number.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Save the spreadsheet reflecting all these
optional modifications with the name </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">part4.xls</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
and submit it via Checkmate.  You&#39;ll get a little extra credit for this,
though it won&#39;t substitute for skipping required parts of the assignment.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Second spreadsheet (picture framing):</B>
 The Framous Amos picture framing service has asked you to design a spreadsheet
to computerize its charging and billing.  Picture framing charges depend
on a number of factors:</FONT></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Sidebar_122.gif" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=114 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The size of the art itself</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The size of the frame (which may be somewhat
larger than the art, to allow for some empty space to set off the art itself)
</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The cost of the framing material (plain
wood is more expensive than plexiglass, for example, and lacquered wood
is more expensive than plain)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The cost of the matting material, if any
(matting, if it&#39;s used, surrounds the art inside the frame, taking up
the blank space between the art itself and the frame)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The cost of the face material, if any (glass,
plexiglass, or UV-screening plexiglass)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Any discount given to the customer</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Sales tax (which we will assume to be fixed
at 8.5% for this exercise)</FONT></P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Your spreadsheet will have cells for the user
to specify each of the following items  (we have also included some example
values the user might enter):</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Client&#39;s name &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>Space
Gallery</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Client&#39;s street address &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>6016
Santa Monica Blvd.</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Client&#39;s city, state, and Zip code &#160;
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>Los Angeles, CA  90038</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Title of the artwork &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>Akira
Kurosaki, Thumbs (1976)</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Height of the artwork in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>7.25</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Width of the artwork in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>9.5</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Height of the frame in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>11.75</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Width of the frame in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>14</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Type of framing material &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>black
lacquer frame</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Cost per linear inch of framing &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>2.40</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Type of facing material &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>plexiglass
face</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Cost per square inch of facing &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>0.75</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Type of matting material &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>black
silk mat</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Cost per square inch of mat &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>0.12</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Percentage discount (zero if none) &#160;
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>15</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Reason for discount &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>gallery
discount</TT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>The cost of the framing material is given
per linear inch (an 8-by-10 inch frame is 36 linear inches), the facing
cost is given per square inch, and the matting cost is given per square
inch (note that the matting area is the difference between the artwork area
and the framed area).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>(There really is a print by Akira Kurosaki
called <I>Thumbs</I>.  It&#39;s in David Kay&#39;s office; feel free to
stop by for a look.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>You will use Excel to build a spreadsheet
that models the Framous Amos invoice.  It should look essentially like the
example shown below: </FONT></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Picture_124.gif" WIDTH=443 HEIGHT=423 ALT="">
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Note particularly how this spreadsheet is
organized:  The user enters the data in the area above the thick horizontal
line (we&#39;ve used the data shown in the example above) and the invoice
itself appears below the line.  The spreadsheet user only needs to type
above the line, entering just the bold-faced information.  The spreadsheet
automatically calculates everything below the line from the values entered
above.  Besides helping to make the data entry task clearer, this organization
helps avoid errors; the user is less likely to type over a cell containing
a formula if his or her typing is in a distant part of the spreadsheet.
 (In fact, Excel has a feature that allows the spreadsheet designer to protect
and lock selected cells, so the user <I>can&#39;t</I> type anything there
by mistake.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part 1:  </B> Create this spreadsheet as
described above.  Put your own name into a page header.  Save two copies
of the spreadsheet, with different data, and submit them via Checkmate.
</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part 2:</B>  Look closely at the subtotal
figure in the example spreadsheet.  It isn&#39;t the correct sum of the
three lines above it!  Why not?  Write a two-sentence explanation of what
caused the problem, including an example of some <I>other</I> set of three
numbers that would cause the same kind of error.  Save your explanation
and example in a file (either Word or plain text) and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>(This is not simply some mistake on the part
of the spreadsheet designer, nor is it a bug in the Excel software.  To
investigate this further, select all the cells in the totals column and
reformat the numbers (choose Cells from the Format menu, click the Number
tab, and select the &quot;General&quot; format from the top of the list
of choices).  Do the numbers you now see add up?  This kind of problem is
common in computing; it&#39;s called &quot;roundoff error,&quot; and it
comes from a discrepancy between the data and the way you choose to represent
it when it&#39;s displayed.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Feel free, within the time available, to make
the screen display as clear as possible for the user, taking advantage of
changing the column widths, row heights, typefaces, graphics, and so on.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Want to see more?</B>  For a full-blown,
professional web-based framing service, check out the Metropolitan Picture
Framing site, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.metroframe.com">http://www.metroframe.com</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Your score will depend on completeness (do
your spreadsheets do everything the specification requires; do you answer
all the questions; and so on), correctness (do they produce the correct
results), and quality and clarity of the spreadsheets&#39; format.</FONT></P>
