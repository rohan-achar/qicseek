<H2>Mesh Generation</H2>

A key step of the finite element method for numerical computation
is mesh generation.  One is given a domain
(such as a polygon or polyhedron; more realistic versions of the problem
allow curved domain boundaries) and must partition it into
simple "elements" meeting in well-defined ways.
There should be few elements, but some portions
of the domain may need small elements so that the computation
is more accurate there.  All elements should be "well shaped"
(which means different things in different situations, but generally
involves bounds on the angles or aspect ratio of the elements).
One distinguishes "structured" and "unstructured" meshes by
the way the elements meet; a structured mesh is one
in which the elements have the topology of a regular grid.
Structured meshes are typically easier to compute with
(saving a constant factor in runtime) but may require more elements
or worse-shaped elements.  Unstructured meshes are often
computed using <A HREF="quadtree.html">quadtrees</A>, or
by <A HREF="voronoi.html">Delaunay triangulation</A>
of point sets; however there are quite varied approaches
for selecting the points to be triangulated.

<P>There has now been considerable theoretical work in the geometry
community on these problems, complementing and building on practical
work in the numerical community.  There is also beginning to be a
convergence of these communities, in which theoretical work is fed back
in to practical mesh generation applications.  Theoretically, the
preferred type of mesh is the triangulation or simplicial complex, but
in mesh generation practice quadrilaterals or higher dimensional cubical
element shapes are preferred (both because fewer are typically needed
and because they have better numerical properties).  Remaining problem areas
in the theory of meshing
include triangulations in dimensions higher
than two, meshes with cubical elements, mesh smoothing,
mesh decimation and multigrid methods,
and data structures for efficient implementation of meshing algorithms.
There has also been some theoretical work on using geometry to partition
meshes by finding small separators of their underlying graphs.
