Thisdocument will consist of two primary components: a requirementsspecification and a system test plan.  Your design must also include aglossary, or data dictionary, which defines all terms used that arespecific to the application you are developing.  Other accompanyingdocumentation may be included as well.<P>In conjunction with this requirements specification, your team mustdevelop an acceptance statement and an initial system test plan covering therequirements. The system test plan must cover all basic software capabilitiesto be provided by the system by applying functional test heuristics (blackbox) to each capability described in the requirements specification anddeveloping a test case for each interaction between capabilities.<P>As has been discussed in class, you have substantial flexibility inchoosing the specific form for the various sections of your deliverables. You'vedone these before, in ICS 52 and ICS 121, so you have plenty of "modeldocuments" to draw from, to help you determine how to structure this statement.<P>A list of the standard items that must be turned in with <em> each </em>ICS 125 assignment and posted on the team's web site are in the course syllabus.Required sections of this document are described below.<HR><H3>Deliverable Objectives/Requirements Qualities</H3>Keep in mind that key objectives of a requirements document are to:<UL><LI> Document the customer's needs</LI><LI> Identify functional capabilities to be provided</LI><LI> Identify non-functional and environmental constraints that must be satisfied</LI><LI> Provide a definitive basis for testing and verification</LI><LI> Identify lifecycle considerations such as incremental sub-system development</LI><LI> Provide a reference tool readable by customer, developer, and maintainer</LI><LI> Serve as a contract between customer and developer</LI></UL>In addition, keep in mind that a requirements document should possess thefollowing qualities:<UL><LI> Complete: everything that is essential is described</LI><LI> Understandable:  the "customer" can read it and be convinced that all hisobjectives and needs are adequately and accurately described</LI><LI> Utility: the information in the document can be used effectively to helpin the design phase (e.g., an OO requirements analysis can aid in developmentof an OO design)</LI><LI> Unambiguous: every reader will come away with the same understanding</LI><LI> Consistent: no contradictions</LI><LI> Abstract: one model, many realizations, and no implementation details</LI><LI> Feasible: the requirements can be satisfied within resource constraints</LI><LI> Even: the entire document is at same level of detail</LI><LI> Effectively modifiable: this is a living document</LI><LI> Concise and appropriate: no extraneous details and not more than required</LI><LI> Verifiable and testable: you can tell when you've met the requirements</LI></UL><HR><H3> Required Document Contents</H3><H4> Introduction</H4>Provide an introduction that discusses the scope and purpose of this documentas well as your specific approaches related to the requirements of thesystem. This introduction should also discuss the organization ofthis document and guide the reader.<H4> Understanding</H4>Expand the understanding section of your original document(prospectus).  Make sure to add descriptions of what steps or actionsyou took to understand each technology or software during this phase.If you make changes to this section, add text describing why the changewas necessary, and why it more accurately reflects your newunderstanding. This section need not be different if your understandinghasn't changed.<H4> Project Plan</H4>This will be an iterative expansion of your previous submission. Expandyour project plan to represent how you have accomplished the work so far.Reassess the project risks. Expand your task network or work breakdownstructure to include the effort expended to complete this task. Based onthe work you have done, revise your estimates on how much your team canaccomplish and deliver.<P>If you make changes, add text describing why the change was necessaryor why it will improve the ability of your team to accomplish the workyou have proposed.<H4> Requirements Specification</H4>You must, of course, provide a requirements specification. Use diagrams to help give appropriate overviews and understanding.Note that pictures may well be an <I>essential </I> element of thecomplete description of any graphical interface.Some suggested contents follow.<UL><LI> Overview of System Requirements</LI><BR>Provides a brief discussion of basic needs and proposed usage. <LI> Environment Characteristics</LI><BR>Describes hardware, software, and users of the system.<LI> Fixed Interfaces</LI><BR>Documents any interfaces to the environment that are fixed and hencenot part of the design of the system (e.g. an external database).<LI> Software Capabilities</LI><BR>Specifies functionality in groups of related capabilities.A diagram is helpful to show the relationship between capability groups.<BR>For each capability, at least the following should bespecified:  Description (functionality of the capability group), Input, Output, Persistent Data (that lasts from one invocation of the system to thenext). Considerations specific to the application domain and other relevantfields may be provided too.<LI> Sample I/O or Scenario</LI><BR>Provides a sample input/output stream describing user interaction withthe system, or similar usage scenario.<BR>NOTE: if useful, the streams can be grouped with the capability groupto which they apply.<LI> Constraints</LI><BR>Non-functional constraints, including safety and securityconstraints.<BR>Quantifiable constraints (e.g., timing and precision).<LI> Goals</LI><BR>Documents any guidance for evaluating alternatives.</UL><h4> Lifecycle Considerations</h4>Discusses capability subsets and/or product families for the purposes ofincremental development and potential changes.<h4> Acceptance Requirements</h4>Describes minimal requirements for system acceptance by the client, suchas the minimum capabilities that must be provided in the delivered system.<h4> System Test Plan</h4><P>Include a test plan capable of demonstrating minimal functionalityof all system elements:test cases should be specified for each software capability specified.<P>NOTE: if desired, the test cases can be grouped with the capabilitygroup to which they apply, otherwise a cross reference listing of somesort should be provided.<UL><LI> For each test case</LI>   <UL>   <LI> Test Case ID</LI>   <LI> Purpose of test case</LI>   <LI> Item(s) being tested</LI>   <LI> Input specification</LI>   <LI> Output specification</LI>      <UL>      <LI> Expected Results or Test Oracle Mechanism</LI>      </UL>   <LI> Test environmental needs or special test procedures</LI>   </UL></UL><h4> Glossary</h4>Defines all non-obvious terms used in the specifications above.May include a detailed data dictionary.<h4> Documentation</h4>This section is reserved for any documentation you may have developed duringthis phase of the project. Specifically, if during the course of developingthe your understanding of the various technologies involved in the project,you discovered items that were not documented, but which were important,then you should include that here.<P>Additionally you should list here the major background sources of informationthat you used during this phase or any that you plan to use during theremainder of the project. This would include references to similar systemsand/or procedures.<hr><h3>Requirements Presentations/Reviews.</h3>See the syllabus for dates.<P>Each team should prepare a 15 minute presentation, after which we willallow up to 5 minutes of questions. Your customer should be present.&nbsp;<p>Prepare your presentation appropriately. Your presentation should includethe following:<UL><LI> Overview of your system;</LI><LI> Current state of your project plan;</LI><LI> Environment and interfaces;</LI><LI> Highlights of your requirements specification including</LI>   <UL>   <LI> Summary of required capabilities, with a diagram if available;</LI>      <BR>one or more detailed requirements for the most important capabilities      <BR>(pick the key issues to discuss in detail);   </UL><LI> Lifecycle considerations</LI><BR>(how you intend to develop the system throughout the lifecycle);<LI> System test plan</LI><BR>how you intend to both demonstrate that the system should be acceptedas well as how you intend to convince yourselves that it is more than acceptable!).</UL><p>  Be <em> sure </em> to focus your presentation on the key issues.  Don'tspend time with the obvious things.  If there's something in your presentationthat you find boring, so will your audience.  Don't gloss over problems. Yourcustomer wants you to succeed, your instructors want you to succeed.   They can'thelp you unless you tell them where you think the problems are, or are likely tobe.<p>You should also ask your customer what he would like to see presented.</BODY></HTML>
