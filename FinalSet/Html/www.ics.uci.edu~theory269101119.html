<h1>Succinct Convex Greedy Drawing of 3-Connected Plane Graphs</h1>
<h2>Lowell Trott</h2>

<p>The authors show that the classical Schnyder drawing in
<b>R</b><sup>2</sup> of 3-connected plane graphs is weakly greedy with
respect to a metric function H(*,*).  The drawing is planar,
convex, and succinct, using two integer coordinates between 0 and
<i>f</i>, where <i>f</i> is the number of internal faces of the graph.</p>

<p>(Based on a paper by He and Zhang to appear at SODA 2011.)</p>
