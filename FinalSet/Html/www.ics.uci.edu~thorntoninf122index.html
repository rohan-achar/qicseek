    <td>The <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a> we reviewed in lecture on Thursday &mdash; an implementation of the Assignment #1 user interface from last year's version of this course, which was nearly identical to the <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2">Project #2</a> user interface from this quarter, except that it had additional commands &mdash; is now available as a Git repository.  You can clone the repository using either command-line tools or EGit, though you might find that EGit helps you to visualize the repository's history more easily than the command-line tools; Git is Git, though, so it's ultimately up to you.</td>

      <p>Welcome!  A few things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, January 8.  For more information about meeting times, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>As I am making some adjustments to this course, relative to the last time I taught it, this course is a work in progress.  The web site will be updated along the way, with the goal behind to keep the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a> estimated a week or two ahead, and remaining material released as needed.  As changes are made, they will be noted here on the news page.</li>
        <li>Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of commented <a href="CodeExamples">Code Examples</a> that will be posted during the course of the quarter.</li>
