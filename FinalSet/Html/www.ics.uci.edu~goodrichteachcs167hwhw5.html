<li> Trappe-Washington, Exercise 10 of Chapter 7.
<li> Trappe-Washington, Exercise 11 of Chapter 7.
<li> 
Alice wants to send Bob a message <i>M</i>
that is the price she is willing to pay for his used car 
(<i>M</i> is just an integer in binary).
She uses the ElGamal algorithm to encrypt <i>M</i> into the ciphertext
<i>C</i>
using Bob's public key, so only he can decrypt it. But Eve
has intercepted <i>C</i> and she doesn't even know Bob's public key. 
Explain how
Eve can alter the ciphertext <i>C</i> to change it into <i>C'</i> so that
if she sends <i>C'</i> to Bob (with Eve pretending to
be Alice), then, after Bob has decrypted <i>C'</i>, he will get a
plaintext message that is twice the value of <i>M</i>.
<li> 
Suppose Eve has captured two ciphertexts <i>C=(a,b)</i> and
<i>D=(c,d)</i> for
two separate message <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>, respectively, that were 
sent to Bob under the ElGamal encryption scheme (using the same public key
for Bob). Explain how Eve can construct a valid encyption of the
product <i>MN</i>.
