<h1>Graph algorithms: Lecture notes on exponential algorithms</h1>

<p>Throughout algorithms classes we learn that polynomial time
bounds are good, exponential bad. This attitude has led to
systematic avoidance of studying exponential time algorithms in
theoretical CS, so it's an area where there may be many low-hanging
fruit. This is also evidenced by the big gap between known
worst-case bounds and experimentally measured behavior.</p>

<h2>Why is it reasonable to study exponential algorithms?</h2>

<p>If they're impractical, isn't it as useful as counting angels on
pinheads?</p>

<ul>
<li>Some exponentials are more impractical than others.</li>

<li>The better ones lead to solutions of moderate-sized real
problems.</li>

<li>Improvements mean big differences in solvable problem sizes
(typically multiplying problem size by some factor) while faster
technology doesn't help so much (typically adding only a small
constant to the problem size).</li>

<li>Polynomial time algorithmics has been criticized on the basis
that if everything's fast, you don't care exactly how fast it is.
This may not always be true (e.g. if server must handle many
requests, speed matters) but exponential problems more likely to
lead to visible runtimes where improvements can be perceived or
even make the difference between solving and not solving a
problem.</li>

<li>The alternative approach of approximation algorithms (more
standard in theoretical CS) is not always suitable (approximations
can be bad, e.g. for graph coloring problems; the cost of computing
a true optimal answer may be made up for by the value of having
that answer; or it may be a problem where approximation does not
make sense).</li>

<li>One can sometimes make the exponential part of the time bound
depend on a parameter other than problem size, which could be much
smaller ("fixed parameter tractability").</li>
</ul>

<h2>Growth rates</h2>

<p>(This is a typical freshman exercise, but let's go through it
again.)</p>

<p>What is a typical "reasonable" problem size we can solve for a
given exponential time bound?</p>

<p>Modern computers perform roughly 2<sup>30</sup> operations/second. So, if
some algorithm takes time f(n), how big can n be to solve the
problem in the given time?</p>

<p>Typical naive algorithms take times in the range 2<sup>n</sup>
up, and can only solve smaller problems. Typical fast worst case
bounds are in the range 1.2<sup>n</sup> - 1.5<sup>n</sup>. typical
empirically measured time bounds are in the range 1.05<sup>n</sup>
- 1.1<sup>n</sup>. So for instance we can solve certain kinds of
constraint satisfaction problems exactly up to 500 variables even
for the hardest examples (and examples coming from applications are
often not hardest): <b>Exponential algorithms can be
practical</b>.</p>

<h2>Backtracking search (branch and bound)</h2>

<p>A simple example: 3-coloring. Start with a recursive
generate-and-test 3-coloring algorithm:</p>

<pre>
color(G,i) {
   if (i==n) {
    test if valid coloring
        if so, return success
        else return failure
   }
   for (each possible color c) {
       try giving v[i] color c
       color(G,i+1)
   }
   uncolor v[i]
   return failure
}
</pre>

<p>There are n levels of recursion, and the recursion branches 3
ways each level, so the time is 3<sup>n</sup>. One obvious
improvement: interleave validity testing into recursion, rather
than waiting until the graph is all colored before discovering some
early mistake.</p>

<pre>
color(G,i) {
   if (i==n) return success
   for (each color c not already used by a neighbor of v[i]) {
       try giving v[i] color c
       color(G)
   }
   uncolor v[i]
   return failure
}
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately while this will make a practical improvement, the
worst case is still 3<sup>n</sup>. The problem is that we need to
choose ordering of vertices in a way that allows early termination
to happen often One possibility: spanning tree preorder (e.g. depth
first search numbering) then, each vertex is colored *after* its
parent (except for the tree root, which has no parent, but we only
need to try one of the three colors there) so we can reduce the
number of branches to 2<sup>n-1</sup>.</p>

<h2>Changing the solution space</h2>

<p>Instead of looking for a 3-coloring, let's look for the subset
of red vertices of a 3-coloring. We can then test whether the
remaining vertices can be 2-colored (i.e., whether they form a
bipartite graph) in linear time. This immediately gives us a
2<sup>n</sup> algorithm (that's how many different subsets of
vertices there are) without as much effort as we took above. With
more thought, we can do even better: if we choose a coloring with
as many red vertices as possible, the red vertices will form a
<i>maximal independent set</i>: a set of vertices, with no edge
connecting any two vertices in the set, such that every remaining
vertex in the graph shares an edge with a vertex in the set. So, we
can solve 3-coloring by listing all maximal independent sets and
testing for each whether the complementary set is bipartite.</p>

<p>The algorithm below solves a slightly more general problem:
given graph G, and sets Y and N, list the maximal independent sets
containing everything in Y and nothing in N.</p>

<pre>
listMIS(G,Y,N)
{
    if (G = Y u N) output Y and return

    choose a vertex v

    if (v not adjacent to anything in Y)
    listMIS(G, Y u {v}, N)

    if (v isn't the final neighbor of a vertex in N)
        listMIS(G, Y, N u {v})
}
</pre>

<p>How to analyze? Obviously the time at most 2<sup>n</sup>, and
one can come up with examples like in 3-coloring where a careless
vertex ordering leads to at least this much time.</p>

<p>We'd like to do better than this. Here's an idea: each iteration
reduces size of G-Y-N by only one vertex, and we want to reduce the
set of undecided vertices more quickly. If we add v to Y, we can
quickly remove all its neighbors (the more neighbors the better).
Define degree(v)=number of neighbors in G-N-Y. Then when we add v
to Y, the size of G-Y-N is reduced by 1+degree(v). If we add v to
N, we don't get as big a reduction in subproblem size, but we MUST
choose at least one neighbor in Y and reduce it that way (so we
want all v's neighbors to have high degree)</p>

<pre>
listMIS(G,Y,N)
{
    if (G = Y u N) output Y and return
    if (some vertex in N has all neighbors in N) return without output

    choose vertex v s.t. all neighbors have degree(neighbor) &gt;= degree(v)
    (e.g. let v = minimum degree vertex in G-Y-N)

    listMIS(G, Y u {v}, N u nbrs(v))

    let A = N
    for each neighbor w in G-Y-N {
    listMIS(G, Y u {w}, A u nbrs(w))
    A = A u {w}
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Analysis: suppose v has degree d then we get d+1 recursive calls
each to a problem with at least d+1 fewer vertices (degree of
neighbors could all equal d, addition of w to A could be redundant
if w is also in later neighborhoods</p>

<p>Oversimplified analysis: suppose d is the same in all calls (it
won't be) then n/(d+1) levels of recursion so time =
(d+1)<sup>n/(d+1)</sup> = ((d+1)<sup>1/(d+1)</sup>)<sup>n</sup>.
The worst case is d=3, time (3<sup>1/3</sup>)<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p>Now do the analysis more carefully: analyse by counting the
number of leaves of the recursion tree (total time is polynomial in
this). We prove by induction that L(n) &lt;= 3<sup>n/3</sup> In a
call with degree(v)=d, then we get</p>

<pre>
L(n) &lt;= (d+1) L(n - (d+1))
     &lt;= (d+1) 3^(n - (d+1))/3  [induction hyp.]
     = (d+1)/3^(d+1)/3 3^(n/3)
     &lt;= 3^(n/3)
</pre>

<p>Corollary: any graph has at most 3<sup>n/3</sup> maximal
independent sets An example showing the analysis is tight: disjoint
union of n/3 triangles</p>
