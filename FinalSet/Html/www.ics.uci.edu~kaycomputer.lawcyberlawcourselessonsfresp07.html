One recurring problem -- some say recurring nightmare -- for the Supreme Court has been dealing with sexually explicit expression.  The Court has generally (rightly or wrongly) reached the following conclusions:<P>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>A.</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>*Obscenity*, defined as speech that
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>-</TD><td>describes or depicts (in words or pictures) sexual conduct in a manner that is patently offensive under contemporary community standards,</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>-</TD><td>appeals to the prurient interest, *and*</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>-</TD><td>taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, scientific, artistic, or political value, is constitutionally UNPROTECTED.  You can go to jail for distributing it (though not for possessing it).  This category is fairly narrow, and excludes virtually all mere nudity, and most things that have any reasonable pretention to serious art.<BR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>B.</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>*Child pornography*, defined as speech that</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>-</TD><td>visually depicts</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>-</TD><td>sexual conduct -- which might include sex, masturbation, and "lewd exhibition of genitals" --</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>-</TD><td>by actual children under the age of 18, is constitutionally UNPROTECTED.  You can go to jail for distributing it *or* for possessing it.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
The rationale behind this exception is that child pornography necessarily involves the use of children in sexual contexts; and that to suppress such use, the law can ban distribution and possession of child pornography as well as its production.  The category is therefore limited to *actual* depictions of children; it almost certainly excludes, say, paintings (or computer-generated images) of fictional children, or verbal descriptions of sexual conduct involving children.
 In this sense it's narrower than obscenity.  But at the same time it's also broader than obscenity:  Artistic value is generally no defense, and the images don't have to be particularly offensive.<P>
More on this in the next message.<P>
