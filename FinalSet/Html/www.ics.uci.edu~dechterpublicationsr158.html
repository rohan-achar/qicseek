  This thesis presents a new generation of search algorithms for
  solving combinatorial optimization problems over graphical
  models. The new algorithms exploit the principles of problem
  decomposition using the AND/OR search spaces, avoid redundant
  solution of subproblems using memory, focus on relevant promising
  portions of the solution space using the power of the mini-bucket
  heuristics and prune irrelevant spaces using constraint
  propagation. As we show throughout the chapters of this thesis,
  putting all these principles together yields powerful algorithms
  whose performance improves upon earlier schemes significantly,
  sometimes by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the
  applicability and the generality of our algorithms on optimization
  tasks over both probabilistic and deterministic graphical models,
  often showing superior performance on real application such as
  linkage analysis and circuit design and diagnosis. The following
  paragraphs elaborate.
<p>
  Our algorithms explore the AND/OR search spaces of the underlying
  graphical model. The AND/OR search space is a unifying paradigm for
  advanced search schemes for graphical models exploiting problem
  decomposability, which can translate into exponential time savings
  for search algorithms. In conjunction with the AND/OR search space
  we also investigate a class of partition-based heuristic functions,
  based on the Mini-Bucket approximation.
<p>
  We start by introducing depth-first Branch-and-Bound search
  algorithms that explore the AND/OR tree, use a variety of sources
  for heuristic guidance and incorporate some dynamic variable
  ordering heuristics. We then extend the depth-first AND/OR
  Branch-and-Bound and best-first search algorithms with the ability
  to recognize identical subproblems and avoid redundant solutions by
  caching (similar to good and no-good recording), thus traversing the
  AND/OR search graph. We also extend all the principles acquired
  within the general framework of depth-first and best-first schemes
  to the well known 0-1 Integer Linear Programs.
<p>
  Our empirical evaluation shows conclusively that the new AND/OR
  search algorithms improve dramatically over current state-of-the-art
  approaches exploring the traditional OR search space, in many cases
  by several orders of magnitude. We illustrate one by one the gain
  obtained by exploiting problem's decomposition (using AND modes),
  equivalence (by caching), branching strategy (via dynamic variable
  ordering heuristics), control strategy (depth-first or best-first)
  as well as the impact of the lower bound heuristic strength.  As
  well, we investigate the impact of exploiting hard constraint
  (i.e., determinism) in the problem, the initial upper bound
  provided to the algorithm, and the quality of the guiding variable
  orderings.
<p>
  In the last part of the thesis we also show how our AND/OR search
  algorithms can be used as compilation algorithms for AND/OR decision
  diagrams. We present a new algorithm for compiling AND/OR
  Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs) that represent the set of
  optimal solutions. We extend earlier work on AND/OR decision
  diagrams by considering general weighted graphical models based on
  cost functions rather than constraints. On various domains we show
  that we sometimes get a substantial reduction beyond the initial
  trace of state-of-the-art search algorithms.
<p>
  Finally, the starting chapter of this thesis (Chapter \ref{ch2})
  sets the stage for this whole work by comparing the power of static
  and dynamic mini-bucket heuristics over regular search spaces and
  compares against a number of popular stochastic local search
  algorithms, as well as against the class of iterative belief
  propagation algorithms.
