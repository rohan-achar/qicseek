<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Course goals:</B>  This course is the first
of a three-quarter sequence covering the fundamentals of computer science.
We focus on software&mdash;not just how to construct it, but also how to choose
and design the underlying algorithms, how to organize the data involved,
and how to analyze its performance.  As an honors series, these courses
will cover a broader and deeper set of topics than the corresponding conventional
courses.  The concepts we will cover transcend the details of particular
programming languages, but ICS H21 will use primarily Scheme ICS H22
and H23 will move on to Java.</FONT></P>
<P>

<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>ICS H21 is an exciting course because of the
many horizons it broadens.  We welcome you, and we hope you enjoy it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course
does not expect any previous experience in computer science or computer
programming.  If you do have some experience, you will find some topics
familiar but many others will certainly be new to you.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>We do expect each student to be able to navigate
the Windows XP systems in our labs, to navigate the World-Wide Web, to download
and read documents in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, and to read and send electronic
mail. Some of our assignments will require these skills.  If you need to
pick these skills up or sharpen them, you should do it in the first week
of the quarter.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:50 in 110 Engineering Lecture Hall. Discussion and lab
section meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 to 2:50, 
in 192 ICS.  Your lab work will be done in
pairs, so the scheduled lab times are the best times to work with
your partner.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop
by my office at any time.  If I'm there and not immersed in something
else, I&#39;ll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.
 I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,
during which course-related matters will have first priority:  Tuesdays from 1:00 to 1:45 and Fridays
from 11:15 to 11:45; I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies
may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. I&#39;ll
also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't blow it off without getting in touch).  The
quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described
below.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to  </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="mailto:icsh21@uci.edu"><code>icsh21@uci.edu</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>.
 This goes to both of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you
need to reach one of us individually, use our individual IDs listed above. I will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitmate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>We may also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another
account, forwarding instructions appear below.</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4> Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official announcements, your grade
could suffer. </FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Textbook and software:</B><I> How to Design Programs,</I>
by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi. We will follow the text closely, but you don't have to buy a copy because you will also find the full text of the book on the web at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.htdp.org"><code>http://www.htdp.org</code></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">.   The on-line  version is slightly more current than
the print version, but many people find it tiresome to read long technical
material on the screen.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">The DrScheme (PLT Scheme) software we will use is available free for all platforms at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.drscheme.org"><code>http://www.plt-scheme.org</code></A></FONT>.</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Labs and lab hours:</B> Of course you will
need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday/Wednesday/Friday
lab hours.  Students in ICS H21 may use any of the school&#39;s instructional
computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the
lab exclusively.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>

for lab hours and other information.   Note in particular that all ICS labs
are closed on university holidays, such as the Friday after Thanksgiving
(but not the Saturday and Sunday).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Please remember that programming tasks always
take longer to complete than you think they will, no matter how much experience
you have.  You must account for this as you plan your time; we cannot accept
busy schedules or time mismanagement as an excuse for late or incomplete
assignments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Course structure:
<BR />
</B><I><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/index.html">Weekly homeworks and lab assignments</A></I> (25% of the course grade). All the assignments
will be available at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/</code></A></FONT><code><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>
.
</FONT></code><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><BR />
<I>Class participation:</I>  Based primarily on participating consistently
and effectively in the lab, including turning in a partner evaluation for each lab assignment (10%).
<BR />
<I>Two midterms:  </I>Given in lecture on October 20 and November 17 (30%
together).

<BR />
<I>One final exam:</I>  On Thursday, December 10, from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. (35%).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>We expect that most students in this course
will earn a final grade in the A range, as you would have done had you been
enrolled in a conventional offering of ICS 21.  However, that is not a guarantee
that every student&#39;s grade will be an A.  Conventional ICS 21 itself
is a six-unit course that requires a major time commitment, even from students
with significant computing experience or strong academic backgrounds.  A
grade of at least B- in ICS H21 is required to continue into ICS H22.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>We&#39;re required to say that in unusual
circumstances, these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to
happen.</FONT></P>
<p><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><strong>Special needs:</strong> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the  range of possibilities. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time. </FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>What to do this week to get started in
ICS H21:
<BR />
</B>&mdash; If you do not have a UCInet ID, get one (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://activate.uci.edu/"><code>http://activate.uci.edu/</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>).
<BR />
&mdash; Learn how to read electronic mail sent to your UCInet ID (see </FONT><a href="http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/"><code>http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/</code></a><FONT FACE="Garamond"></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>). If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your
UCInet account, redirect your mail at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html"><code>http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>
.
<BR />
&mdash; If you do not have an ICS account for access to the Windows network in
ICS, get one.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/account_faq.php"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/account_faq.php</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>

.
<BR />
&mdash; On the Web, go to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><code><a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a></code></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>,
log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing,&quot; click &quot;Go&quot;
next to ICS H21, and then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot;  You&#39;ll
submit some of your work electronically; this step is necessary to set that
up.
<BR />

&mdash; Get a lab printing key-card if you plan to do any printing in the lab.
<BR />
&mdash; Give a snapshot of yourself (with your name written on the back) to your
TA.  This will help us learn your names quickly.  (This is not just for
fun&mdash;it&#39;s a course requirement.)  <br />
&mdash; Complete the survey at <a href="http://eee.uci.edu/survey/h21.f09.q"><code>http://eee.uci.edu/survey/h21.f09.q</code></a>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Good advice and helpful hints:  </B>Make
every effort to attend the lectures; we will make important announcements
and often cover material that isn&#39;t directly in the textbook.  It&#39;s
not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed, though
of course the TA will always answer questions about it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Attend your discussion and lab section, too;
assignments will be discussed and collected there, exams will be reviewed
there, and you can hear a different perspective there than you hear in lecture.
 Don&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you. 
Since most of your work will be done with a partner, your partner also depends
on your consistent presence.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Check your electronic mail regularly; this
is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need
it to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few
missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.
 You will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about
parts that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>The assignments, like all technical specifications,
require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back
to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about
what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure
to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required; professional
programmers plan on paper prior to starting to type.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Start each assignment early.  Assignments
will be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly
every day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it
will, even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early,
you&#39;ll have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>If you find yourself having trouble or getting
behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.
 But never take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and turning
it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on a lab
assignment.  ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more complete
discussion, see the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty
issues (</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>).
</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Turn in whatever portion of the assignment
you have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something
rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances
you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after it&#39;s
due, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date comes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle
(or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened), we&#39;ll
expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.  </FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>* <!--We will use the new second edition of the text for Chapters 1&ndash;7; it is available (only) on line at <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/"><code>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/</code></a>. After Chapter 7, we go back to the first edition. -->Note that some chapters <!--in the first edition-->
are called Intermezzos.
 Intermezzo 2, for example, occurs between Chapter 12 and Chapter 14, so it&#39;s
the same thing as Chapter 13.</FONT> <BR CLEAR=ALL />
