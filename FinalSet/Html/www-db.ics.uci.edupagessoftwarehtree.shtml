<li> <a href="htree/htree.tar.gz"> Hybrid Tree code </a>.
<br> <br>

<li> After downloading the file (on a SUN SPARC 
machine running Solaris), first do "gunzip htree.tar.gz" 
and then do "tar xvf htree.tar". 
<br> <br>


<li>  The <a href="htree/htree_README"> README </a> file describes how to
compile, run and customize the code. Please read it before compiling/running
the code.
<br> <br>

<li> For more information, please read the paper 
on <a href="htree/htree.ps"> Hybrid Tree </a> or
contact <a href="mailto:kaushik@ics.uci.edu"> kaushik@ics.uci.edu </a>.
<br> <br>

<li> To understand how multipoint queries and arbitrary distance functions 
(e.g., arbitrary Lp metric with arbitrary weight along each dimension)
are handled in the hybrid tree, please read sections 2 and 3 of the paper 
on <a href="htree/icde01.ps"> query refinement </a>.
<br> <br>

<li> To run query refinement on top of hybrid tree, download 
<a href="htree/htree_refine.tar.gz"> this </a> code. The code contains
a <a href="htree/README_relfeed"> README_relfeed </a> file that describes
how to run the code along with the hybrid tree code. Note that 
the refinement code would not work unless you have downloaded the 
hybrid tree code (from above).
<br> <br>

<li> Among others, the hybrid tree code is being used by:
<ul>

<li> Prof. Hyo Jong Lee and his students at Chonbuk National University in Korea

<li> Dave Thomas at AdInjection.com for a project in his company

<li> Dr. Progress Q. T. Mtshali for student projects
data mining class at the Nova Southeastern University .

<li> Devasis Bassu at Telcordia Technologies

<li> Huang Wu at the National University of Singapore for his research work

<li> OuYang WeiMin at Anhui University, China for research

<li> Dang Tran Khanh at Johannes Kepler Universit�t Linz

<li> Database Lab at University of California at Riverside for research
</ul>
