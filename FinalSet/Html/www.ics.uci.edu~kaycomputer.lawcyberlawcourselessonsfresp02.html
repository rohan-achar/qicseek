<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The First Amendment Applies<BR>
Only to the Government</FONT></H1></CENTER><P><P>
The first few words of the First Amendment are &quot;Congress shall make no law . . . .&quot; The Bill of Rights was originally meant to apply only to the federal government, not to the states or to private organizations.<P>
 The Fourteenth Amendment, which says that &quot;No State shall . . . deny any person . . . liberty . . . without due process of law,&quot; has been interpreted to apply the protections of the First Amendment equally to state governments. (There's a hot debate about whether this is a historically sound interpretation, but we'll set this aside here.) And courts have also read the First Amendment as applying to executive agencies and the federal courts as well as Congress.<P>
 But absent really exceptional circumstances, the First and Fourteenth Amendments do *not* constrain private entities: Private employees, private university, private dinner party hosts, private businesses.<P>
 There can be nothing unconstitutional about a private list moderator rejecting your posting to a discussion list, Prodigy editing out your dirty words, or a service provider refusing to let its users put up Nazi-themed Web pages. Only &quot;state action&quot; (which actually includes all government action, including federal action) implicates the constitutional protections.<P>
 What if the speech restrictions are imposed by a private actor who is in some way related to the government - for instance, subsidized or employed by a government agency? The rule is that &quot;state action&quot; is present only when the speech restriction is dictated or influenced by the government. Thus,<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> - GOVERNMENT FUNDING ISN'T ENOUGH: If a private employer restricts what his employees may e-mail, there's no state action, even if the employer gets all its business from government contracts.<P>
 - GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPUTER ISN'T ENOUGH: If a public university lets someone set up a moderated discussion list on its computer, and the moderator excludes certain messages, there's no state action, even though the list is on a public computer.<P>
 - GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT OF THE MODERATOR ISN'T ENOUGH: The fact that a list moderator is employed by the government is not by itself enough: If a public university lets a faculty member set up a moderated discussion list, there's almost certainly no state action, so long as the faculty member's decisions are his own and not dictated by the government.<P>
 - GOVERNMENT DICTATION OF SPEECH RESTRICTION IS ENOUGH: But if a public entity has an employee set up a moderated list, and *instructs* the employee to reject any, say, profane or bigoted messages, there is state action (though conceivably, as we'll see below, the government's action might still be constitutional).<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
 Qualification: This relates only to rights under the U.S. Constitution. Some state constitutions and state statutes do provide protection against some private speech restrictions. A California law, for instance, generally bans many restrictions imposed on students by private universities.<P>
