<h3>Pair Programming Partner Evaluation</h3>
</div>

<p>Once you and your partner complete Lab 3, we want you to evaluate your experience with your partner by completing the Pair Partner Evaluation Form below and submitting it at the date and time given in the Course Schedule. We do not share this evaluation with you partner.</p>
<div class="section">

<h4>Evaluation Questions</h4>
</div>

To evaluate your partner,

<ul>
<li><p>Copy the form into the <i>body</i> of an email; do not make it an attachment.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the evaluation. You can indicate your choice from various options by deleting all the options for the question except the one you want to pick. Answer the open-ended questions by simply typing in your responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the subject of the email "Partner Evaluation"</p></li>
<li><p>Email the completed evaluation to <font class = "codefacesmall">
<a href="mailto:ics45j@ics.uci.edu">ics45j@ics.uci.edu</a></font></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although the open response questions are phrased to elicit a yes or no response, you are required to include at least a brief comment to elaborate on your answer, and you can comment at length if you wish; the goal is to paint us a picture of the nature of your partner&#146;s participation in paired work, and what you think about pair programming. </p>

<p>If you were given approval to work alone instead of in a pair, complete this evaluation about yourself as best as you can, revising it as necessary to make sense in that context. For example, the first question could be interpreted as &#147;Did you come to lab on time and ready to work?&#148;</p>

<p><b>Open response questions</b></p>

<li><p>Did your partner read the assignment and preparatory materials before coming to the scheduled meetings, showing up either with specific questions or ready to contribute?</p></li>

<li><p>Did your partner cooperatively follow the pair programming model (rotating roles of driver and navigator, questioning and making observations as the navigator)?</p></li>

<li><p>Was your partner's participation professional and cooperative overall?</p></li>

<li><p>Have you found pair programming helpful in completing the programming work and learning about programming in general? If you have previous experience programming alone, do you now prefer working in pairs?</p></li>

<h3>Choosing your Next Partner</h3>
</div>
<p>One Assignment 4, you may choose to work alone, or with a partner; your partner can be your current partner or a new one. The same holds for Assignment 5. And each choice is independent: for example, you can work alone on Assignment 4 and work with a partner on Assignment 5, or work alone on both, or have a partner on both. You are responsibile for finding your partner(s).</p>

<p>If you do work in a programming team, that team turns in one, jointly-done programming assignment; do make sure both members' names and ID numbers are included in comments at the start of the code. Obviously, if you work alone on the assignment, you turn in your own assignment, written solely by you.</p>

<p>Whether you work alone or in a team, do remember to follow the course academic honesty rules as discussed in the Course Reference.</p>
