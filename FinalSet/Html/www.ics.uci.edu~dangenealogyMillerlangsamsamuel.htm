(sara) langsam the name diller is somehow  connected to us.

mother or uncle. my grandmother died in 1985 her married name was wertenteil.

Hi,
Sorry for the delay, I just returned from vacation. I will reply in more detail later.
What is your connection to Yocheved Benjamin (if any)?

Hi,
You are H6 in the Langsam book. It lists quite a bit about your family. 
Yocheved went to school with my wife. Abe Balken works with me (same floor). 

I would love to explore more. The best thing would be to supply me with a fax number 
so I can send you a copy of your page. 

In the interim, can you ask your mother more about the Diller connection? 

I have lots more questions, but they will be more easily understood if you can see the 
existing research. 

One other thing. Have you seen my page on Diller as a link on 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/langsam.htm
The actual page is at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/naomi-g.htm

my mother doesn't really know about the diller connection much. she just knows that we are 
connected. i have a friend that just got married and her new name is diller she said she'll 
try to find out.
i don't have a fax and i live in Israel so it would be easier just to give the page to abe 
(his wife is my first cousin). i went over your website and even copied some parts to my 
computer.
maybe my uncle (yocheved's father) knows more - he's in touch with my grandmother's sister 
who is still alive.

OK, 
Let's start easy. I scanned it in. It is a gif file attachment. Can you read it?
Also, can you show this to your mother? Email it to anyone else?
Can you expand on it? Where do you fit on the attached view?
Thanks!

The best thing would be to ask my uncle, Yocheved's father. My mother doesn't really know much 
about the family background.

I don't know other langsams. Next week i'll try to find out some information from my friend. 
I think her husband's grandfather (Diller) is a holocaust survivor.
