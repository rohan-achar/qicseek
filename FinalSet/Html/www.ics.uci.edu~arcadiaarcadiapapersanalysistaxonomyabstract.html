<H2> Abstract </H2>

The conventional classification of software fault detection techniques as 
static or dynamic analysis is inadequate as a basis for identifying useful 
relationships between techniques. A more useful distinction is between 
techniques that sample the space of possible executions, and techniques 
that fold the space. The new distinction provides better insight into the 
ways different techniques can interact, and is a basis for considering 
hybrid fault detection techniques including combinations of testing and 
formal verification.
