In addition to his scientific and technical employment, Dr. Lathrop
also has supported himself by doing road construction; installing
fiberglass insulation; short order fry cook; dishwasher; bus boy;
ditch digger; plumber's helper; carpenter's helper; seismic crew
member; and day laborer.  His most memorable job was dishwasher on the
Alaska Railroad, working the Anchorage-Fairbanks line.  Twelve hours
of heartbreakingly beautiful Alaskan wilderness where not even roads
go, sleep overnight in the railroad depot in Fairbanks, and twelve
more hours of wilderness back to Anchorage, all viewed from a window
above the dishwashing sink.  The train passed close to Denali, the
highest mountain on the North American continent; and sometimes when
Denali was shining cloudless and snowcovered in the sky and reflected
in full majesty by a mirror-still wilderness lake, the engineers would
just stop the train and let everyone drink in the beauty.
