<h2>What's New</h2>
<ul>
  <li>[9/26] For those of you unfamiliar with this class (most of you): ICS 229 
    is a seminar in which YOU make all the presentations.<br>
    <br>
    Students in past years have presented a wide variety of things: some students 
    use the class as a forum in which to give a "dry run" of a presentation they'll 
    be making at a conference. Some have used it as a way of getting ready for 
    their Phase II oral exam by presenting their survey paper. First year grad 
    students are usually in the most difficult spot: you're just starting your 
    graduate student career, so what do you present? Probably a best answer is: 
    present a technical paper that you believe to be both interesting and significant 
    --- something you think everyone else would be interested in. If you need 
    help in identifying an appropriate paper I can make several suggestions. A 
    great place to start is the Phase II reading list:<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/software/phaseII_reading_list.html"> 
    http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/software/phaseII_reading_list.html</a> <br>
    <br>
    Attendance in the seminar is mandatory (I will take attendance) and you MUST 
    make a presentation sometime during the quarter. <br>
    <br>
    The purpose of the first meeting (tomorrow's) is simply to set up the schedule 
    for the rest of the quarter. The class will be over by 2:25. So --- think 
    about what you'd like to present, or at a minimum, WHEN you would like to 
    make a presentation. We'll put names to dates and then we'll be done. You 
    do not have to commit to a specific topic tomorrow, just a specific date.<br>
