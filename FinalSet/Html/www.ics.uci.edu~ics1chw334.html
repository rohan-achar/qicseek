<h3>Three neat Web finds:</h3>
<ol>
<li>One of the nicest starting points the Web is the <A 
HREF="http://white.nosc.mil/everything.html">Planet Earth home page</a>.  
It's like gopher with visuals and even includes a list of search 
engines.
<li>For those mysticists out there, you can have your <A 
HREF="http://cad.ucla.edu:8001/tarot"> tarot</a> read.  This reading uses 
the simple three card spread so be prepared to use your 
intuition.  If your intuition is <i>really</i> on track try the <A 
HREF="http://www.circus.com/~vagabond/Velcro/Sjodiac/lscopeindex.html"> 
Sjodiac </a>. <li>If you like the element of the unknown visit <A 
HREF= "http://legendre.ucsd.edu/y/randomjump1.html">A Thousand Points of 
Sites</a>.  Its a page full of little red dots.  Each one takes you to a 
new web page.  Tre risque.

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>The World Wide What?!?</H2></A>
<p>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide 
Web</a> was begun only last decade at <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a>,
 the European Laboratory for Particle 
Physics in Switzerland.  WWW is a universe of ideas and information 
accessed via network and is a research tool of immense magnitude.  Though 
the Web is not dependant on the Internet to function, it is dependant on 
it to access the volumes of information that is out there.  The Web was 
conceived as a means to share information without regards to the various 
different protocols and emulations that computers use.  <A 
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html"> HTML</a> is 
the backbone of the Web.  Hypertext markup language allows one to jump 
(almost) instantaneously from one document to another.  A <i>web 
browser</i> is necessarry to use html.<A 
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-about.html"> 
NSCA Mosaic</a> is the web browser of choice at the moment.  However, 
there are many other browsers out there such as Lynx, NetScape, Cello and 
many others.  They all offer basic web access while some offer multimedia 
capabilities.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>HTML? What possible use can it be to me?</H2></A>
<A HREF="http://www.iuma.com/~scam/"><IMG ALT="[SCAM]" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=59

Spending hours upon hours online cruising the web can be a very social 
thing.  In fact there is a whole culture known as <a 
HREF="http://www.circus.com/~omni/geek.html"><i>geeks</i> </a> that does 
just 
that.  My favorite bunch is the Santa Cruz geeks.  For a peek at what 
they're up to, check out the <A HREF="http://www.iuma.com/~scam/">SCAM</a> 
or Santa Cruz Alternative Music page.  This page also offers links to 
geek happenings.  Html is their voice to the world.  Many geeks have 
their own pages and commune in <A 
HREF="http://klinzhai.echo.com/~falcon/geeks/geekhouse.html"> <i>geek 
houses</i> </a>which often house web servers of their own.
<p>
But html isn't just about being social.  As a research tool, the Web is 
absolutely amazing.  You can visit the <a HREF=" 
http://acacia.ens.fr:8080/index.html.en"> Icole Normale Supirieure</a>, a 
student server in France, any major university (and even some smaller 
ones) in the world, a restaurant guide for your favorite city and even 
shop electronically.  And, of course, with a decent knowledge of html you 
can post web pages of your own.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>To be or not to be...at the Rennaissance 
Faire?</H2></A> 
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/index.html"><IMG

<p>
So <A HREF="http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/index.html"> <i>what is 
this Faire thing anyway?</i> </a>  Throughout the year there are 
recreations of the medieval and rennaissance time periods of Europe held 
all over the country.  In California the major events are the Rennaissance 
Pleasure Faires, northern and <A HREF="http://www.resort.com/~banshee/ExploreSouthern/Explore-Southern.html">southern </a> , run by the Living History Center.
  These particular faires feature authentic culture of the Elizabethan 
(Shakespearean) period: food, entertainment, 
and even a battle or two.  Keep in mind that it is always more enjoyable 
to go to faire in <A 
HREF="http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/Costume/costume.html"> 
<i>period costume</i> </a>.  The actors 
treat you much better and you'll get a better feel for rennaissance life 
if you can join in.  The <A 
HREF="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu:80/~rodmur/sca/"> 
SCA </a> (Society for Creative Anachronism) is dedicated to recreating 
and chronicalling the time period and also offers wonderful insight to 
medieval and rennaissance life.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>How would one say, "You have dishonored my
   hamster?" in Klingon?</H2></A>
<A HREF="http://www.kli.org/"><IMG 
SRC="http://www.kli.org/KLItrefoil.gif" alt="" width=135 height=120--> </a>
<p>
"nay'qoqvammo' DaHoHta" means (if I have interpreted my research properly) 
"You have dishonored my tribble."  In the Klingon language "tribble" is 
the closest approximation to hamster.  After all, isn't a tribble just 
a hamster with no legs?
<p>Didn't you ever wish you cold toss around a few 
phrases in a foreign language?  Spanish and French just a little too 
boring for you?  Then try the <A HREF="http://www.kli.org/"> <i>Klingon Language Institute</i> </a>.  
Here you can look up any Klingon phrase in the archives, research Klingon 
history, see the <A HREF="http://www.kli.org/kli/pIqaD.html">writing 
system</a>, and even <A HREF="http://www.kli.org/kli/address.html">become a 
fluent member</a> of the Institute.

<p>
<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>Momma, I hungry. Whats for dinner? Where to 
find gourmet food.</H2></A>
<p> 
One of my favorite snacks is gourmet popcorn.  Yummy, yummy.  I don't 
care what the media says about it being healthy, unhealthy or otherwise.  
<A 
HREF="http://www.glasswings.com.au/GlassWings/arcade/myers/mgp.html">
<i>Meyers Gourmet Popcorn</i> </a> will deliver your order right to your 
door and even gift wrap it in a nifty, pretty tin.
<p>
But one can not live by popcorn alone.  So for the true gourmand I offer 
you the <A HREF ="http://www.deltanet.com:80/2way/egg/eggpage.html"> 
<i>eGG</i> </a>, or electronic Gourmet Guide, an e-zine 
absolutely devoted to food and cooking.  Right now they're only on issue 
#5 and it's already an awesome little zine.  They have interviews with 
famous chefs, quick tips and piles of <A 
HREF="http://www.deltanet.com/2way/egg/recipes.html"> <i>recipes</i> </a> 
as well as reviews of cook books.  This is one of my favorite pages 
because, in my house, if I want anything besides chinese food to eat, I 
have to make it myself.  
<p>
Bon apetit!
