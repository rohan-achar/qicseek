<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>
Flight has eluded man for most of his existence on the Earth. He has 
seen birds and insects flying and has wondered what the feeling must 
be like. Then, when man was able to achieve flight, with the use of 
some basic fluid physics and plain old ingenuity, he looked to go 
beyond the barriers of the blue skies above.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="past">The Past & Present: Earth Flight</A></H2>
From the earliest of times, man has jealously studied winged beasts
and yearned to share their freedom in the skies. And man, being an 
intelligent beast, has finally found success. The faltering flight of 
the Greek youth Icarus, who flew too close to the sun, demonstrated that 
man does not innately fly.  Mankind went back to the drawing board 
and used his intellect to create a more stable platform on which to 
roam the skies: the airplane. 

<H3><A NAME="wright">The Wright Brothers</A> and Their Flying 
Machine:</H3>

In September of 1904, a farmer's field in Dayton Ohio became the site 
of a miraculous
<A HREF="http://hawaii.cogsci.uiuc.edu/invent/airphotos/public/First_Flight.jpeg">
circling flight</A>.
This was the first flight
<A HREF="http://dab.psi.net/ChapterOne/children/browse/wright.html>
Orville and Wilbur Wright's</A> new contraption, the airplane
The flight lasted exactly one minute and thirty-six seconds, thrusting 
the two bicycle repairmen into the record books for the 
longest flight of an airplane. Of course, it was the first ever 
flight of an airplane.

<H3><A NAME="gold">The Golden Age of Aviation</A></H3>
The Golden Age of Aviation, the time between the great wars of the 20th 
century, was a time to &quot;flex our wings,&quot; as a nation, and as a 
people who were now able to explore a whole new environment: the 
skies above.
<P>
Barnstorming, a popular fair activity, was fun for &quot;layman&quot;,
as flying was still a novelty, and it was a lucrative 
business for the pilot. He could fly a barnstorming carnival one day, 
and then be flying mail across the country the next.
<P>
In 1927, the <A 
HREF="http://photo1.si.edu/images/gif89a/air-space/stlou1.gif">
Spirit of Saint Louis</A> had made a flight, non-stop across the 
Atlantic to Europe, with Charles Lindbergh at the controls. The world 
was growing smaller by the year, a foreshadowing of the jet age, 
ushered in by the military development of aircraft during the next 
war, World War II.
<H6><A HREF="#table">Table of Contents</A></H6>

<H3><A NAME="military">The Military</A>
<img src="http://www.vestnett.no/vulcan/pics/thumb/f117-1.gif" ALT="f117-1.jpg"></H3>
It is unfortunate that war and killing can lead to some of the 
quickest development in technology. It seems that some of the 
greatest advances of aviation technology, or all in all technological 
development for that matter, have taken place to kill people more 
efficiently.
<P>
When airplanes first entered the military arena, they were used only 
for reconnaissance purposes. This held true until one pilot took a gun 
into the air, and then a bomb, turning the air arena upside down.
There was a new environment 
where it was kill or be killed, both for the pilots in the air, and 
for the bombed out troops and civilians.
<P>
Based on the lessons of World War I, the bombers of World War II were 
made to be much more efficient. This led to planes that flew higher and 
faster, important in the emerging nuclear age. With the advent of 
nuclear 
capabilities, it was thought that one either needed faster planes, or 
planes that could fly higher. Either way, one would have to escape the 
effects of delivering nuclear ordnance. And even with this, much 
research was being done in the mixed arena of missile/space research 
to potentially make aircraft obsolete for these purposes .
<P>
The military, in an effort to describe its operations more fully in 
an environment of downsizing and spending cuts, has found it helpful 
to describe their operations on a more pronounced scale, especially 
by putting some of their public information on the World Wide Web. 
This seems to help build a rapport with the taxpayers
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.af.mil/">United States Air Force</A>
has an extensive server which gives the description of many of the 
units under its command and gives as much de-classified information 
as possible. It is unfortunate that they still do not have more 
historical information available, but they seem to be 
forging ahead with new projects and leaving the past to another day.
<H6><A HREF="#table">Table of Contents</A></H6>
<H3><A NAME="civil">Civil Aviation</A></H3>
When it comes to Civil Aviation, one may think of late planes, and 
honey-roast peanuts and which is sometimes true. But, were it not for 
the pioneers of the past and the pressures of war development,
we would not have quality commercial pilots flying
our planes today. Nor would flying be one of the safest and most 
rapid methods of travel over long distances. We owe some of this to 
the military training of our pilots, and also to the 
development of the new technologies pilots test and use.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Travel/Airlines/">
yahoo index of airlines</A> provides a link to some of the 
commercial airlines, but something that we didn't expect to see was 
advertisements, which still seem to be the scourge of the internet.
<P>
Civilian aviators also enjoy use of the Web in that they are able to 
disseminate the latest information to one one another. There are 
numerous <A HREF="http://adswww.harvard.edu/GA/ga_servers.html">
general aviation servers</A> available for people to browse. This is 
an excellent way to learn about and perhaps join a new
<A HREF="http://adswww.harvard.edu/GA/ga_servers.html/#flying_clubs">

<H2><A NAME="space">The Future: Space Flight</A></H2>
<P>
After man was able to fly in the air of the biosphere and stratosphere, 
and look down at the Earth from what was perceived as great height, he 
began to dream of going even higher to investigate the heavenly bodies 
surrounding the small blue sphere that is home. Man had entered the space 
age.
<P>
Governments, hungry for new resources, were eager to establish 
agencies and administrations to organize efforts to reach into space. The 
nature of space exploration to find resources has grown and changed along 
with the world political climate: sometimes competitive, other times,
cooperation is the order of the day. Sputnik, the first ever man-made
satellite to orbit the earth, was sent up by the Soviet Union, beating the
United States' space program, and, beating national morale. According to
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/matrix/internet/hobbes.internet.timeline">
Hobbe's Internet Timeline**</A>, the launch of Sputnik was enough of a 
political catalyst to lead to the formation of the Advanced Research 
Projects 
Agency within the U.S. Department of Defense, the organization that helped 
begin the creation of the internet. But cooperation reigns now, with a 
joint Russian/U.S. mission having gone into space just a few days before 
writing this essay.
<BR><I>**(Hobbe's Timeline does have the erroneous year 
1956 for Sputnik's launch. The actual year is 1957.)</I>
<P>
Agencies, in some cases asked to
<A HREF="http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/~jgreen/fpspace.html">
justify their existence</A>, have found it 
necessary to take their &quot;reason for being&quot; to the people of the 
nation, and the world. This means an agency has to advertise and 
publicize, but advertising is expensive, and needs to be big enough to 
attract the attention and support of the citizens of a nation, or, of the
world. 
<P>
One answer has been to link an agency with other agencies through
joint, cooperative missions
and by sharing research
experiences with scientists and general citizens on the Internet, 
especially via the World Wide
Web. This allows the agency to make the case that they are keeping the
nation competitive with other world powers, that they are spending well
the vast moneys allocated them, and that they are spending in a way which
is efficient, relevant, and holds the agency accountable to the citizens, 
or to those funding the agency's programs.
<P>
One can find links to
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/nasa/other_agencies.html"> other space
agencies</A> at almost every space agency's Web site.  Also, joint
research projects or missions are given a prominent place on Web site. One
example of this is the
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/hqpao/hqpao_home.html">NASA Public Affairs
Page</A> where one finds information on NASA's mission, and its
beginnings.  Another example is found in Italy at the
<A HREF="http://hp835.mt.asi.it/00HTL/asi.html"> Agenzia Spaziale
Italiana</A>, where you will find information about the goals of the space
agency, and their current missions, as well as information about their
cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.esrin.esa.it/">European Space
Agency.</A>
<H6><A HREF="#table">Table of Contents</A></H6>
<H3><A NAME="coop">Space Cooperation: Get There and Back with 
Maximal Efficiency</A></H3>
<P>
We have come a long way from the
<A HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/astp/astp.html">Apollo-Soyuz 
Test Project</A> which was the first international manned spaceflight 
(in this case, between the Soviet space agency and NASA). The project 
was more 
of a test to look into the similarities and differences between the spacecraft
and space programs, and less of a cooperation between the political entities
of the the Soviet Union and the United States. The two space agencies 
were looking into the possibilities of using each other's spacecraft for 
rescue missions, and also for potential future space missons. The 25 
year anniversary of this historic mission will be July 15-20, 1995. The 
astronauts may have only shared a few moments, some food, and the fitting 
of two halves of a medallion together, but these gestures led the U.S. 
and the then Soviet Union that much closer to cooperation in space 
flight.
<A HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/astp/astp-goals.txt">(ASTP goals)</A>
<P>
While the two superpowers of the time, the Soviet Union and the US, were 
busy trying to feel out each other's capabilities, and still remain 
competitive, the
<A HREF="ftp://ns3.hq.eso.org/pub/un/un-homepage.html">United Nations Office 
for Outer Space Affairs</A> realized that the launch of Sputnik by the
by the Soviet Union in 1957, and the subsequent &quot;space race&quot; it 
had started, would lead nations to possible conflicts in space. An ad 
hoc committee was created in 1958, and became an official committee at the 
United Nations in 1959. This committee has set out to establish rules and 
regulations that will help keep space a peaceful place, as well as 
recognize that astronauts are impartial human explorers. They are not 
involved in conflict, and if they should land in another country, 
they should be returned to their nation of origin. Cooperation was, 
and has become something important, something to preserve our world 
and also keep space free for all to study and explore.
<P>
One of the latest examples of cooperation was &quot;launched&quot; on 
March 14, 1995, just a few days before starting on this paper, 
and is one of the most exciting joint missions between the US and Russia: 
the launch 
of a <A HREF="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/tm21.html">
Russian Soyuz TM-21 Rocket to their Mir Space Station.</A>
This is the first Russian (or Soviet, if the Soviet Union were 
still intact) mission ever to carry an American Astronaut into 
space. Two Cosmonauts, and Dr. Norman E. Thagard, an American 
astronaut, will conduct experiments aboard Mir, and will return to 
Earth aboard Space Shuttle mission
<A HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-71/mission-sts-71.html">
STS-71</A>, when the Space Shuttle will dock with Mir for the first 
time ever.

<P>
<H6><A HREF="#table">Table of Contents</A></H6>
<H3><A NAME="colony">The Ultimate Flight: A Journey to New 
Colonies</A></H3>
This will be the ultimate form of cooperation possible between the 
nations of the Earth and their space programs. The mission to dock 
with Mir is the first step in creating
<A HREF="http://issa-www.jsc.nasa.gov/ss/prgview/prgview.html">
Space Station Alpha</A>, a joint, multinational space station. Part 
of the reason for this cooperative effort is that Mir is already in 
space and it is  an ideal &quot;stepping stone&quot; for building 
another space station. It can support life for extended periods of 
time, and can be resupplied with relative ease by the American Space 
Shuttle. The Americans need something pre-established, while the 
Russians need 
cash (as &quot;rent?&quot;) and other countries are willing to pay to 
have a lab for potentially ground-breaking research.
<P>
When the space station is completed, the next step will be to create 
a colony on some other planet, or at least on another space station. 
Thoughts about this are already in the works.
A <A HREF="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/SpaceSettlement/">
space settlement</A> will probably be a joint effort to keep costs 
down in these harder economic times. It will also be a new experience 
for cultural exchange and interaction in a smaller community. 
Civilians will eventually colonize, and a community with fewer 
personal barriers will hopefully form.

<H2><A NAME="conclusion">Conclusion</A></H2>
Man may not have wings, but the birds still wonder what the heck jet 
planes are, and we still gawk in awe when the Space Shuttle is 
launched on another misson. Man has taken to the skies, and there is 
little chance we will ever be grounded again. We can fly in the worst 
weather with sophisticated computers, and we have been able to put 
men on the moon. Where we will go next, and what planet we will 
colonize, or orbit with a space station, no one yet knows. But we are 
no longer an earth-bound species and the future lies in the sky.
