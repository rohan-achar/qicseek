  <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6><B>What to Ask the Instructor</B></FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond">When you get an assignment as a TA or reader, the
first thing  to do is get in touch with the instructor of
the course.  You will need to find out what the instructor expects you to
do, make sure there aren&#39;t any insurmountable scheduling conflicts,
and begin to prepare for your teaching assignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond"><B>In advance &mdash; </B>There are some things you can
find out  by yourself in advance:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond">What are the first and last days of the quarter? As a TA, you're expected to be available on campus between these dates; you mutst have permission in advance from the instructor of your course to show up later or leave earlier. <em>Find the academic calendars at <a href="http://www.reg.uci.edu/navigation/calendars.html">http://www.reg.uci.edu/navigation/calendars.html</a> .</em></FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Garamond">When and where does the class meet?<BR />
</FONT></LI>
<LI>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond">When and where do the discussion and lab sections
meet?</FONT>
  <font face="Garamond"><em>Check these using the <A HREF="http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/">on-line schedule of  classes</A>
(<A HREF="http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/">http://websoc.reg.uci.edu</A>);
times and rooms often change after the printed schedule comes out, and sometimes
as late as the first week of classes.</em></font></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Garamond">Do the lectures or sections conflict with your own classes or other obligations? <em>You may need to make adjustments once you know what your TA duties involve.</em></FONT><font face="Garamond"><BR />
</font></LI>
<LI>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond">How has this instructor (or other instructors) organized
this course in the past?</FONT>
  <font face="Garamond"><em>Most instructors&#39; home pages have links to syllabi
(and sometimes other materials) for the courses they teach.  A few minutes
spent looking at these will give you a good outline of the course&#39;s
organization (though of course things may change from one quarter to the
next).</em><BR />
  </font></LI>
</UL>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond"><B>Asking the instructor &mdash; </B>The questions listed
here apply to a broad range of courses and go into some detail.  You shouldn&#39;t
expect the instructor to provide absolute, definitive answers to all of
these questions.  It&#39;s impossible to predict every task that may need
doing during the quarter, and it&#39;s important to be flexible as the needs
of the class become clearer over time.  Instructors may prefer to let you
resolve some of these issues yourself, or in consultation with other TAs
or readers for the course.  Nonetheless, the sooner you get answers to any
of these questions, the better you can plan and prepare and the better you
can balance your teaching responsibilities with your other obligations.</FONT></P>
