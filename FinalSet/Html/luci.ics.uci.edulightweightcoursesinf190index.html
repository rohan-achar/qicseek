<p><b>Prototyping Ubiquitous Computing Projects</b></p>
<p>These projects are proposals for the Informatics 190 course. You can also feel free to propose your own project idea. All
of these projects will be supervised by Prof. Hayes as part of the ubicomp
prototyping class or as part of an independent study, but a lot of
other faculty and graduate students are involved. I list them where I
can, and you should feel free to talk to them about the projects as
well. These projects are listed in no particular order... so please
read them all.  </p>
<b>Brainstorm Board</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/bboard_.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with David Nguyen, Andre van Der Hoek, Gillian Hayes and Patrick Shih) Brainstorming is a collaborative activity. The Brainstorm Board is a large group display that will connect to participants' laptops (local and remote) to foster brainstorming. Our current exploration uses mindmaps (also called concept maps) as the underlying mechanism for brainstorming. Development will involve retooling an open-source, single-user java application to be multi-user.  </p>
<b>Nomatic*VS: Visual Schedules for kids with autism</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/nomaticvs_.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Mo Monabi, Donald Patterson, Gillian Hayes, and Nick Noack) Visual schedules and choice boards are tools used in current best practices for helping children with autism and other special needs.  These non-verbal kids need help communicating their choices, understanding time and activities, and so on. We are working with Windows SmartPhone, Linux small displays, and large touchscreen-enabled platforms to develop solutions that ease these burdens, provide logging and visualizations of data, and help automate some of the features of using these communication techniques. Development might involve working with any of these devices using python, java and/or C#. We may also use RFID and other sensor technologies to expand into the physical world from these displays.</p>
<b>UbiPlay and Smart Toys</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/Ubiplay.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Silvia Lindtner, Gillian Hayes, Nick Noack) UbiPlay and Smart Toys involve building sensing in toys and mobile devices. Manipulation of the objects can be linked to a digital representation such as a virtual world or an online game, thus creating an interplay between physical interaction and virtual spaces. Games have often been used to stimulate physical activity in children and adults. With this project we will allow children explore the intricacies of sensors, mobile technology and the Internet, while motivating them to interact and collaborate and physically move in their everyday settings. We will collaborate with medical centers and schools to inform the application design. This project involves design and development on mobile devices and with sensors (e.g. GPS, biometric sensors).</p>
<b>CONRAD: COmmunity Navigation Reception And Display</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/conrad.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Nick Noack and Donald Patterson) Use small displays around the building to foster awareness of office activities. These displays will show location, status, activities, announcements, and any social context the office owner wants. They will also provide a place to leave and read messages between the office owner and people stopping by. Development work will be done using Nokia n800 devices, linux, python and java.  </p>
<b>Technology Garden: Human-Plant-Technology Interaction </b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/tg.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Eric Kabish and Silvia Lindtner) We wish to facilitate new forms of awareness and interactions among humans and nature through and with technology. The Technology Garden is located in the office space 5054 of Donald Bren Hall. We will use a variaty of sensors such as motion, light, and moisture to detect the plants' states and activities in the room to create an aesthetic expierence. Development involves creation of social software (e.g. a Blog), sensor data acquisition and data storage.  </p>
<b>Social Stories</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/digstory.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Khai Truong from Univ. of Toronto and Brian Landry from
Georgia Tech) Social stories are a way to teach children with special needs about appropriate behavior in social situations. Teachers and parents often struggle to create these stories from scratch. In this project, you will evaluate current out-of-the box digital storytelling and comic book creation technologies and then create new or adapt one of these tools to facilitate social story creation.  </p>
<b>Location Enabled Games </b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/LEG.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||Location Enabled Games Glofun has created a development kit for creating "hidden worlds" called LEGs for Location Enabled Games. Bring your own fun ideas and create new games, performances, and interesting experiences on and with mobile phones.</p>
<b>MedReader</b> 
<p>(with autism researchers and medical informatics) Patients and caregivers alike struggle with reading complicated medical reports. This project aims to support this practice by automatically recognizing characters, trends, and keywords in these medical reports and teaching patients about them by linking to online resources, facilitating word lookups and more. Development will likely be done in Java but can be flexible. </p>
<b>Mobile Music</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/mobilemusic.jpg"/>
<p>|||||||(potentially with researchers from Intel and Nokia) Openstrands has created the mystrands open source services that can integrate music playing and recommendations into mobile applications.  Building on work done at both Intel and Nokia, you can use these services to create next-generation music playing and recommendation services on the mobile platform. Of particular interest are applications that allow friends to play each other's music, recommend things to each other, and negotiate what gets played in a group setting.</p>
<b>Second Life ICS </b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/secLife.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Crista Lopes) Did you know there is a second life Donald Bren Hall on Anteater Island? Spend some time there building widgets that match our real Donald Bren Hall and prototyping new cool interactions that we might someday make into ubicomp applications in the real world.</p>
<b>mopix: playful encounters with surveillance</b>
<img src="websiteContent/weAreLuci/courses/inf190/pictures/mopix_.jpg"/>
<p>||||||||(with Silvia Lindtner, Judy Chen, and Paul Dourish) This project is all about location-aware photo sharing. Public displays might be distributed throughout an urban environment, a campus, or a building that allow people to share pictures from their mobile phones.  The goal is to build communities through mobile photo-blogging.  Development work will be done in Python on Nokia N80 mobile phones and N800 devices. </p></span>
