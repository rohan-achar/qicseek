<h1>
Deriving greedy algorithms and Lagrangian-relaxation algorithms
</h1>

<h2>Neal Young, UC-Riverside</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
We will discuss how one can use randomized rounding to systematically
derive primal-dual algorithms  --- particularly greedy algorithms and
Lagrangian-relaxation algorithms --- for approximately solving
packing and covering problems such as set cover, vertex cover, and
multi-commodity flow.  The talk should be of interest to those
interested in probabilistic methods and to those interested in
approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.
