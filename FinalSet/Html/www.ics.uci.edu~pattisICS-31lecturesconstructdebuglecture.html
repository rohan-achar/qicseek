In this lecture we will learn some general information about
  iterative-enhancement as as technique for designing, coding, testing,
  and debugging programs.
Then, we will discuss debugging both syntax errors and  execution/runtime
   errors in Python.
Debugging is a skill that you will become more adept at as the quarter
  progresses (because you will be doing so much of it).
This lecture is coupled with a handout that includes practical
  information about learning and using the
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/debugger/debugger.pdf">
     Eclipse Debugger Perspective</a>; 
  please read it and follow its instructions.
Once we have learned to operate this tool, we can explore how to use
  it for debugging.
<p>
This tool is not only useful for debugging programs, but it is also useful
  for understanding Python control structures, function/method calls (and their
  parameters and local variables), and objects (and their instance
  variables).
So, we will use it in the classroom repeated during the quarter (and
  you should use it to explore these topics, even if you don't use it to
  debug your programs).
<p>
As a warmup for debugging, please read the
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/bugs.html">Bugs in Programming</a>
  web page.
Most programmers write code that is about 80% correct.
The mark of a good programmer is that he/she systematically locates and
  corrects each bug in the program until it is 100% correct; in contrast, a
  poor programmer randomly changes the program (without knowing the cause of
  the bug or the implications of the changes) and will actually REDUCE the
  correctness of the code.

<td width ="20%"><b>Program Construction via Iterative Enhancement (Design for Debugging)</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Programs/scripts are almost always written based on some <i>divide and
  conquer</i>  approach to problem solving.
Such approaches rely on the belief that it is harder to solve one large
  problem than to solve a sequence of smaller subproblems (which lead to the
  solution of the large problem).
So, in designing a program, we must determine how to divide the larger problem
  into a sequence of smaller subproblems, and then conquer/solve each one
  individually.
In industry, a team of programmers working on the same project may solve
  these problems in parallel.
<p>
The divide and conquer approach that we will use mostly is 
  <b>Iterative-Enhancement</b>.
Given a problem (a specification of a program to write)
<ul>
  <li>We start by writing a <b>kernel</b> program that meets some
        dramatically simplified version of the specification.
  <li>We extend the kernel by writing a sequence of programs, each an 
        enhancement to the previous one (each is called a <i>phase</i>),
        which includes more and more of the specification.
  <li>We eventually reach the final phase, which is the last program in the
        sequence; it meets the entire specification and solves the entire
        problem.
</ul>
By analogy, think of trying to cross a river; we could try to jump it in a
  single bound, or we could try to find a path of stones in the river bed,
  and jump from stone to stone, getting closer and closer to our destination,
  until we reach the other side.
Each phase in the enhancement is like a stepping stone.
<p>
In addition, this approach allows us to gauge our progress, with each
  finished phase acting as a milestone.
If it has taken us 3 hours to finish the first 4 phases of a project, and
  there are 4 more phases to go (and we assume each phase takes about the 
  same amount of work), we can predict that it will take us about another 3
  hours to finish.
Such an estimate is crude, but it is better than no estimate at all.
<p>
Pictorially, we can look at the process as follows.

<td width ="80%">
We will practice this method, on a small scale, in our early programming
  assignments.
It requires some perspective (and experience) to take a complicated program
  specification and identify a good kernel and design a good sequence of
  enhancements.
<ul>
  <li>The kernel should capture something essential about the problem,
        without getting bogged down in details.
      Often the kernel captures the information needed to construct the main
        loop in a program.
  <li>Each phase should be a reasonable amount of work, focusing on one
        different aspect of the problem, adding in more details.
</ul> 
he phases involve designing, coding, testing, and debugging a small amount of
  related code to create an enhanced program.
It is critical that each such program is testable, so that we can verify that
  it meets its enhanced specification and that we are truly making progress
  towards our ultimate goal.
If any design element or its code fails to work, we will discover it quickly
  and fix it immediately; we won't spend lots of time building other parts of
  the code that depend on a wrong decision, and then have to undo that work.
<p>
To start on a program, we need a good -but not perfect- understanding of the
  problem being solved.
So, we should try to understand as much as we can before starting, but we 
  don't need to  understand everything; don't be afraid to begin.
During the process of writing our program, we will learn more and more
  details about the problem, as we tackle more and more details in the
  enhancements.
Our "understanding" of the problem willl increase, the more we work on
  writing a program to solve it.
Eventually we will acquire an understanding of every detail of the problem,
  because we have implemented every detail in our program, telling the computer
  how to accomplish it, in the terms the computer understands.
<p>
When we learn how to write our own functions, we will be able to associate
    an action (some code) with a name.
Then, by just referring to the name, we can execute the code.
Sometimes the discovery of functions is bottom-up: we realize that we
  are performing the same computation over and over again, so we write a
  method for it.
Sometimes the discovery is top-down: before we even write any code we
  realize that certain functions can act as useful building blocks, so we write
  them.
<p>
When we learn how to write our own classes, we will apply the same
  bottom-up and top-down processes, but on a larger scale.
First we identify useful classes and all the methods that they define.
Next we test each class independently, by testing its individual methods.
Once each class is working, we can test combinations of classes, as we use
  them to build the entire application program.
Thus, we are always employing some kind of divide-and-conquer approach to
  solve our programming problems.
<p>
Another key feature of iterative enhancement is <b>focus</b>.
Each enhancement focuses on designing and coding a small number of additions
  or modifications to an already working program.
When debugging a phase, we typically need to focus on only the small amount
  of code that we recently added/changed.
In this way, we can effectively build large programs by focussing on one
   piece at a time.
The biggest problem is then making sure the pieces all fit together.
<p>
The human brain can only keep track of so many details at a time; if we wrote
  a huge amount of code and tried to debug it all, it could easily overload
  our mental capacity.
Often engineers talk about the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
Iterative-enhancement lets us keep each task simple.
<p>
Finally, at the end of each phase we should <b>simplify</b> our code
  as much as possible: step back and try to come up with equivalent code
  that is easier to understand (and often smaller).
Because we are building on our code, and making it more complicated by
  further enhancing it, we want to always start each enhancement with the
  simplest working code possible.
Simplifying during iterative enhancement will be much more effective
  (because of focus) than trying to simplify an entire program after
  it is written.
Time spent simplifying code will pay for itself with time saved in later
  enhancements.
<p>
What makes programming a difficult activity is controlling complexity.
When programs become too complex, we cannot easily fix or enhance them.
Now that we have learned all the control structures of Python, our next
  focus will be how to reduce their complexity by writing functions and
  classes (and using the classes already provided in the Python library.
Here is a relevant quote that emphasizes this issue: the "skill of the creator"
  means the creator's ability to control complexity.
<blockquote>
Computer Science is the first engineering discipline in which the complexity of
  the objects created is limited solely by the skill of the creator,
   and not by the strength of raw materials.-B. Reid

<td width ="20%"><b>Testing Software</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Testing is the process of running software looking for errors (meaning 
  actively trying to make the program fail by testing it in many -even
  unexpected- way): failure of the program to produce correct output from
  some correct input.
Once testing shows the presence of a bug, debugging begins (the process of
  fixing errors found during testing).
Before discussing the process of debugging, let's look a bit at the process
  of testing.
<p>
Professional software testers acquire great skill and intuition at thinking-up
  "good" inputs  on which to test programs.
They are valued members of a product team.
For example, Microsoft employs about one tester for each programmer.
Sometimes these testers work in teams separate from the programmers; at other
  times a tester will pair up with a programmer.
When the programmer finishes some part of the code, the tester begins testing
  it while the programmer proceeds to the next part of the code.
If the tester finds any bugs, the programmer must fix them before continuing.
As you can imagine, programmers often dislike testers because the latter are
  always pointing out mistakes made by the former!
<p>
But, it is better to have the mistake pointed out by your coworker than by
  your boss (or a customer).
No programmer wants to believe that his/her code contains errors; but they
  all do contain errors.
Some would argue that the programmer, intimiate with the code he/she has
  written, is the best person to test it.
But, having a programmer test his/her own code might be bad from a
  psychological point of view:  he/she might not test the code as rigorously,
  because he/she doesn't really want to find any errors.
Having a separate tester addresses this problem.
<p>
But even this approach can cause problems: if a programmer knows an
  independent tester will be examining his/her code after it is written,
  the programmer may write code carelessly, knowing it is someone else's
  job to spot problems.
Thus, there is a real tangle of incentives when writing and testing code.
How Microsoft produces software (an overview accessible to students in this
  course) is discussed in Cusumano and Shelby
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684855313/qid=1031956797/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-9542912-5644017?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">
  Microsoft Secrets: How the World's Most Powerful Software Company Creates
    Technology, Shapes Markets, and Manages People</a>, Free Press, 1995.
<p>
In <b>Agile</b> programming methods (which includes Extreme Programming,
  which includes Pair Programming) programming is test-driven.
Before doing any coding, a programmer or tester develops an extensive suite
  of tests that the code must pass.
Only then is the code written: and the programmer's progress is judged by
  the number of tests in the suite that it passes (which is a bit like
  using iterative enhancment to judge the progress of programming).
If the code is modified later, it must repass all these tests.
We will discuss unit testing when we learn about writing functions (functions
  are the smallest unit we can test), which helps automate test-driven
  programming.
<p>
There are two general categories of testing.
In <b>black-box</b> testing, testers write test-cases based only on the
  specifications for what the code is supposed to accomplish; they are not
  allowed to look at the code itself.
In <b>white-box</b> testing, testers write test-cases based both on knowledge
  of the specifications and the code itself: certain kinds of tests might
  suggest themselves if the tester examines the code.
Of course, black-box tests can be developed before or while the code is
  written, but white-box tests can be developed only after the code is
  written.
<p>
Industry testers often write/use long scripts when they
  <b>regression test</b> programs.
Each time a program is changed, the tester executes the script to ensure that
    no bugs were introduced in old features (it still works as it always has).
Then the script is extended for the new features being tested.
Much of the work in regression testing can be automated: often the result of
   such tools is either a message confirming that all tests were passed, or
   a list of outputs (and their inputs) that differed between the original
   program and the one now being tested.
<p>
Finally, <b>integration tests</b> determine whether software components,
  written and tested separately (in <b>component</b> or <b>unit</b> tests),
  work together correctly in a program.
It is much easier to test/debug each component by itself, than in a system
   comprising many components.
In systems, even simple bugs can manifest themselves in hard to understand
  situations.
Many features added to programming languages at the end of the 1990s were
  designed to simplify software integration
<p>
We will discuss many of these aspects of testing in more detail in a later
  lecture, focusing on Python's ability to write unit tests inside the functions
  and classes they are testing.

<td width ="80%">
Once testing has found an error, we can begin debugging: trying to locate
  the source of the error and fix it.
Debugging is also a task suited to solution by divide-and-conquer techniques.
We don't need to remove all the bugs from a program all at once; instead, if we
  can remove one bug, then another, etc. we will eventually remove them all.
Also, when we are looking for the location of a bug in a program, we can
  divide the program into regions and search for the bug in smaller and
  smaller regions until we find it.
The key idea is to continually make progress, never getting stuck for too
  long on one problem (maybe switching to solve another if we run dry on the
  ways to fix the first).
<p>
We will divide debugging into syntax bugs and execution/runtime bugs.
Syntax bugs are often diagnosed and reported by Eclipse, which shows
  their location (or a close approximation) and a description of the error
  (or a close approximation).
Execution/runtime bugs are much more difficult to fix, primarily because WE
  must first notice them and then find which statements in the program cause
  them: it is much easier when Eclipse tells us there is an error and near
  which line.
The hardest part of debugging is tracking down the location of an error: once
  we have accomplished this task, actually fixing the bug is often much
  simpler.

<!-- Syntax Errors -->

<hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Syntax Bugs</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
As we learned in our first lecture, the earlier a problem is discovered,
  the less time/money it will take to fix it.
Syntax errors are discovered very early.
The Eclipse detects and reports these before running the program; so they are
  much easier to fix than execution/runtime errors.
In fact, some programming languages, with even stricter rules than Python, spot
   even more errors as syntax errors; errors which in Python become apparent
   only at runtime (when actually running the program).
Paradoxically, we should be happy whenever Eclipse reports a syntax bug:
  given that the program has an error, Eclipse saves us from having to run and
  locate the error later, at runtime (a more complicated process).
<p>
Never say that a program is correct until it contains neither kinds of
   errors.
Many introductory programming students say, "My program has no errors but it
  is not working correctly", when they should be saying, "My program has no
   syntax errors, but it still has execution/runtime errors".
Although no one likes to be told of syntax errors in their programs, Eclipse
  focuses our attention to fix these errors before running our programs, and
  thus eliminates many harder-to-debug execution/runtime errors that would
  otherwise occur.
A well designed programming language is one that allows errors to be
  detected as early a possible.
<p>
Technically, Eclipse detects and reports a syntax error when it examines a
  token that cannot legally appear next in the code.
Thus, either that token is wrong, or some recent one that preceded it was.
So, first check the token itself, and then those immediately preceding it.
Understand what you are trying to accomplish with these tokens and use this
  knowledge to help determine what is wrong with what you wrote.
A great help in fixing subtle syntax errors is working code (in some other
  program) that uses the same language features correctly; compare the two 
  to find the problem; sometimes you have to do this comparison very carefully.
<p>
Common errors include missing colons, mismatched delimiters (parentheses,
  brackets, and braces), misspelled names, and the wrong number/type of
  arguments to operators and functions.
Eclipse uses the Python interpreter to find some of these early (as syntax
  errors) while finding others later, as runtime/execution errors.
Sometimes it does a relatively good job of explaining the syntax errors that it
  finds, but sometimes its messages are cryptic (or even just plain wrong);
  it takes a bit of intuition to interpret these messages (a skill that we
  will continue to acquire as we debug more and more of our programs; in
  fact, we can acquire this skill while helping to debug other people's
  programs too: that is why teachers are so good at debugging).
<p>
The best strategy is to try to fix the first syntax error reported.
Sometimes you might scan the first few syntax errors and be able to fix more
  than one at a time; other times you may be confused by the first syntax
  error but be able to fix a later one.
In fact, sometimes fixing one syntax error eliminates others, because they
  all have the same root cause: imagine you misspell a name the first time you
  use and, and then spell it correctly later.
Eclipse might show many syntax errors, all fixed by correcting the initial
  misspelling.
<p>
If you cannot fix a syntax error, seek help; when you understand what you
  did wrong, write down the problem, the error message, and the solution in
  an error log, which you can consult whenever you have hard-to-fix syntax
  errors; learn from experience.
<p>
Incorrectly matching delimiters can cause very many syntax error messages that
  are not indicative of the real problem.
For this reason, whenever you type an opening delimiter (e.g., a parenthesis or
  quote), Eclipse will automatically type a matching closing delimiter position
  the cursor inbetween the two for you to continue typing.
<p>
Python's use of indenting to delimit blocks is a feature not supported by many
  other programming languages: others require the statements in a block appear
  between {} - open/close brace characters, which are not as easy to see.
So Python helps programmers cut down on their errors (which is good; it is
  excellent for beginning programmers who are easily confused about blocks).

<!-- Execution/Runtime Errors -->

<a name="ExecutionErrors"><hr align="left" width="33%">

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Execution Bugs</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
If we run a program with no syntax errors, it might still be incorrect.
The program may or may not behave as it should: a simple program may not
  compute and display the correct results; a more complicated one may not
  do the right thing when you click its buttons.
If either case, it has an execution/runtime error.
Technically, an <b>execution/runtime error</b> is something that Python detects
  arnd reports (like raising an exception when dividing by 0); an
  <b>intent error</b> goes undetected by Python, which finishes the program
  without an execution/runtime error, but nevertheless computes an incorrect
  result.
In the discussion below, we will refer to both kinds of errors as execution
  errors.
<p>
Debugging execution errors is hard: we have to leave our ego at the door,
  admit that WE put an error in our program, and then systematically locate
   and fix the problem.
The golden rule of debugging is to find the <b>simplest</b> input on which
  a program consistently produces an error (this makes debugging much
  easier).
We can apply the techniques described below most effectively when debugging
  the program on the simplest input causing an error.
So, if we find an input that causes the program to fail, we should keep
  trying simpler inputs (fewer values, smaller values, etc.) until we find
  the simplest one on which it fails.
Only then do we start debubugging.
<p>
Job #1 in debugging is finding the location of the error.
Once we know which statement contains a wrong instruction (wrong not
  because of syntax, but because it is not the right statement for the
  program to execute), finding how to fix it is often much simpler.
The typical way to find the problem is to <b>instrument</b> the program with
  calls to <b>print</b> that display the current state of the "relevant"
  objects bound to names.
We can build complicated programs that trace themselves: we can use an
  <b>if</b> statement testing a <b>trace</b> variable to determine whether
  to print information (for a <b>boolean</b>) or what level of information
  (for an <b>int</b> trace level) to print as the program executes.
Eventually, we will find that some name is bound to the wrong value and that
  is the location of the error.
<p>
When we write programs using iterative enhancement, each phase should display
  the names that it defines and/or changes, so we can see if the new
  parts of the program are binding names to objects correctly.
<p>
Sometimes a program gets into an infinite loop: the test controling
  termination of a <b>while</b> loop is wrong and the loop never terminates.
If we put a call to <b>print</b>  inside the body of the loop, and the loop
  becomes infinite, we will easily spot the error because that information
  will print out over and over and over again, indicating an infinite loop.
Typically such print functions print the values bound to names that are being
  used to determine when to terminate a loop.
<p>
Sometimes we write call <b>print</b> functions displaying no names, just
  literals.:
 <b>print('About to execute critical statement')</b>
but more frequently, they look like
    <b>print('After update: x =',x);</b>
Always uniquely label your prints so you know from where in the program each
  piece of information is printed.
The amount of time you spend typing-in such statements is dwarfed by the
  amount of time you spend studying them; so make the the effort to show the
  output clearly.
<p>
Printed values will always appear in the order the program executed them.
But sometimes Python will show the results of a call to print and ther result
  of unhandled exception in a muddled order.
So don't get too confused by such lack of sequentiality.
<p>
Once we find a bug (the hard part), it is often takes much less work to fix
  it.
Often, we do some oval-diagram or hand-simulation to more closely analyze the
   problem.
Whenever we fix a bug, we should immediately hand simulate (or rerun) the
  new code to ensure that it now works correctly.
If it does not perform as expected, undo the change and go back to the old
  code to look for a different fix.
Often students first ideas are best, they just need a bit of polish.
We should not keep any change in our code unless we observe that the change
  improves the code: one change may not completely correct the code, but it
  should improve it.
If we make lots of changes that don't improve the code, we will degrade the
  code and make it harder to fix it: we will lose the original thread-of-thought
  we had when we wrote the code.
<p>
Again, the first effort of a programmer is often 80% correct.
Students have a tendancy to make unsupported changes in code they are
  debugging, often taking code from being close to correct to being further
   away.
Good programmers verify that each change improves their code; if a
  change does not improve things, remove it and go back to the original code.
They keep making improvements until the code is correct.
The measure of a good programmer is not necessarily how many bugs are
  initially present in his/her code, but how quickly he/she removes those
  bugs that are present.
<p>
Here are a few simple debugging tips.
Of course, using the Debug Perspective can help us do all of these tasks.
There are the kinds of things Sherlock Holmes would say when trying to track
  down a criminal.
<ul>
  <li>Eliminate obvious errors first: make sure the data is being read
       correctly from a file before trying to debug the code that processes
       it (if the data is not being read correctly, of course the processing
       code will produce incorrect results).
  <li>Ensure that every name is bound to a reasonable value before its value
        is used the first time.
  <li>If an expression is computing an incorrect value, display the values of
         all the names used in the expression (one of them may be wrong).
  <li>If you are unsure which part of an <b>if/else</b> is executing, put
        something like the following at the top of a block containing the
        statements the <b>if/else</b> controls:
<pre><b>  if test:
      print('if (test): test was True');
      real statements to do for True test
  else:
      print('if (test): test was False');
      realstatements to do for False test</b></pre>
  </ul>
Of course we can use single stepping to see how Python is executing our code
  in the Program window and see the values bound to the names in the Variables
  window.

<td width ="80%">
The Eclipse Debug perspective helps automate some of the hand simulation
  and program instrumentation needed to debug programs.
It allows us to do the equivalent of these without entering more code and
    then rerunning our programs.
Debuggers contain many powerful features allowing us to monitor the
  execution of a program: both the location of the statement that it is
  being executing, and the values bound to any names declared in the program.
<p>
Some programmers prefer to avoid using a debugger and instead instrument
  their code carefully as they write it.
Others prefer to master the debugger, which they can use quickly to locate and
   help correct many kinds of errors.
A blend of the two approaches is probably best (but it takes some experience
   to do that well).
