<P>Inversion is a very useful symmetry operation on circles, generalizing 
mirror reflection through a line.  An inversion is performed with respect 
to a particular center point and choice of scale; then each point in the 
plane is transformed to another point, forming the same angle to the center 
but with distance inversely proportional to its original distance.

<P>The center and scale can be specified as a single circle (shown in red 
in the animation below).
To invert a point outside this circle, such as the blue one in the bottom 
right of the animation, draw a circle (yellow) having as its 
diameter the segment from the given point to the inversion circle's center;
this circle crosses the inversion circle in two points; connect those 
points by a line and also draw the perpendicular line from the given point to the 
inversion center (also yellow).  These two lines cross at the inverse of 
the point.  To invert a point inside the circle, simply reverse these steps.
The animation below depicts several geometric figures 
(blue) and their images (green) under inversion through the red circle.

<P>The key properties of inversion are that it transforms circles to 
circles, and preserves the angles of crossings between circles; in 
particular inversion preserves the tangencies of a collection of circles, 
such as the <A HREF="three-circles.html">three tangent circles</A> shown 
in the animation.  Note that the blue line through two points is inverted into a circle, 
through the center of the inversion.  When interpreting geometric figures 
using inversion, lines should be viewed as infinite-radius circles that go 
through a special "point at infinity" which is the image under inversion of 
the inversion circle's center.

<P>Many geometric constructions and proofs can be simplified by using 
inversion to transform the figure into a more symmetric situation.
