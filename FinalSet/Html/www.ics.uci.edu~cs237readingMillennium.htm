<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Abstract</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>We believe it is time to reexamine the operating system&#8217;s role 
in computing. Operating systems exist to create an environment in which 
compelling applications come to life. They do that by providing abstractions 
built on the services provided by hardware. We argue that advances in hardware 
and networking technology enable a new kind of operating system to support 
tomorrow&#8217;s applications. Such an operating system would raise the level of 
abstraction for developers and users, so that individual computers, file 
systems, and networks become unimportant to most computations in the same way 
that processor registers, disk sectors, and physical pages are today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Introduction</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The users, operators, and programmers of distributed systems 
face many problems. Users of the World Wide Web are subjected to random 
performance and service disruptions. Replacing or upgrading a personal computer, 
workstation, or server is very difficult. Even a moderate size computer network 
requires significant expertise to configure and maintain. The principal 
programming abstractions available today&#8212;processes, threads, files, and 
sockets&#8212;do not adequately address the problems of managing locality, 
availability, or fault tolerance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>We believe that a distributed operating system, based on a few 
principles pervasively applied, could address these problems. Such a system 
would enforce extreme location transparency&#8212;any code fragment might run 
anywhere, any data object might live anywhere&#8212;and the system would manage the 
locality, replication, and migration of computations and data. The system would 
be self-configuring, self-monitoring, and self-tuning. And of course, it would 
be scalable and secure.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>As part of the Millennium project at Microsoft Research, we are 
attempting to design and build such a system. We do not harbor the conceit that 
it will be possible to be fully successful in such an endeavor, but we do feel 
that the time is right for radical experimentation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This position paper describes our goals for the system and some 
principles that support those goals. We then discuss relevant technology trends 
and consider some examples of what such a system would be like. Finally, we 
discuss related research efforts and conclude.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Goals</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Our goal is to dramatically improve users&#8217; computational 
experience. To that end, the system should have at least the following 
properties:</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Seamless distribution.</B> The system should determine 
  where computations execute or data resides, moving them dynamically as 
  necessary. Users should be able to use any computing device that is part of 
  the distributed system as naturally and productively as they would use the 
  machine on their desk or in their den at home.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Worldwide scalability.</B> Logically there should be only 
  <I>one</I> system, although at any one time it may be partitioned into many 
  pieces. For example, disconnected or weakly-connected operation creates 
  temporary network partitions.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Fault-tolerance.</B> The system should transparently 
  handle failures or removal of machines, network links, and other resources 
  without loss of data or functionality. This should hold true for both the 
  system itself and for its applications. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Self-tuning.</B> The system should be able to reason about 
  its computations and resources, allocating, replicating, and moving 
  computations and data to optimize its own performance, resource usage, and 
  fault-tolerance.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Self-configuration.</B> New machines, network links, and 
  resources should be automatically assimilated.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Security.</B> Although a single system image is presented, 
  data and computations may be in many different trust domains, with different 
  rights and capabilities available to different security principals. Like the 
  Internet, the system should allow non-hierarchical trust domains with no 
  central authority necessary.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Resource controls.</B> Both providers and consumers may 
  explicitly manage the use of resources belonging to different trust domains. 
  For instance, while some people might be content to allow their data and 
  computations to use any resources available anywhere, some companies might 
  choose, for instance, not to store or compute their year-end financial 
  statement on their competitor&#8217;s machines.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Principles</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>To achieve these goals, we propose a distributed operating 
system built on the principles of aggressive abstraction, storage-irrelevance, 
location-irrelevance, just-in-time binding, and introspection:</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Aggressive abstraction.</B> The level of abstraction 
  should be raised to the point that application programmers are freed from the 
  mechanics of distributed programming and the exigencies of physical computing 
  components. This would allow them to focus on application concerns&#8212;actually 
  solving a problem for a user&#8212;rather than system concerns such as communication 
  or fault tolerance. To the greatest extent possible, the system should handle 
  difficult issues like data placement, resource location, fault-tolerance, and 
  load-balancing.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Storage-irrelevan</B><STRONG>ce.</STRONG> There should be 
  no storage hierarchy. Once created, information should be accessible until it 
  is no longer needed or referenced.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Location-irrelevance. </B>Objects should be allowed to 
  reference each other and invoke operations without regard for their current 
  location or replication state. The system should have a seamless appearance 
  despite its underlying distributed nature. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Just-in-time binding. </B>Bindings to particular 
  computations, data, and hardware resources should be made only when actually 
  required, preventing applications from creating bindings that would interfere 
  with distribution or fault tolerance. Computations or data could be 
  arbitrarily duplicated and bindings made to one instance would be equivalent 
  to bindings to other instances. Just-in-time binding would enhance resource 
  access and management as the operating system could redirect access to a 
  resource at any time or for any reason to an equivalent entity.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Introspection. </B>The system should possess some aspects 
  of self-examination and reflection. It should pervasively monitor itself and 
  its applications, and reason about configuration and performance issues. Its 
  models of its own configuration and operation should suggest opportunities for 
  self-tuning as well as generate suggestions for physical configuration changes 
  or upgrades that would improve performance. </FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2>Aggressive abstraction addresses a number of the goals that we 
have laid out. The system should provide applications with highly abstract 
virtual machine semantics. Defining computations in software terms, independent 
of any particular platform or configuration, would allow state to be maintained 
in an abstract form and only be compiled to an efficient executable form at the 
last possible moment. Because the operating system would retain ultimate control 
over computation, typical applications would not even be able to express access 
to low-level system resources. This would allow the operating system to protect 
computations from each other, transparently migrate and distribute them, and 
intercede in their access to resources.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Storage and location irrelevance address the issue of seamless 
interaction with information independent of its properties. Interactive users 
could walk up to any computer anywhere and have their active applications and 
personal data follow them. Programs should work the same regardless of how their 
components are distributed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The Internet provides good examples today of the kind of 
just-in-time binding we would extend to all object interactions. Server names 
and addresses on the Internet often do not refer to specific resources but to 
collections of systems that take on an Internet "identity" or address for a 
particular collection of users. Users are becoming accustomed to what can best 
be described as "binding-by-search" as information is referenced not by name but 
by keyword or attributes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Introspection guarantees that the system should take 
responsibility for determining where a computation executes or data resides. The 
programmer should not have to decide whether code will execute at a "client" or 
"server." Instead the system&#8217;s assessment of its hardware resources and usage 
patterns should determine the placement of computations and data. This would 
allow the operating system to provide fault tolerance, high availability, and 
self-tuning behavior for applications.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Technology Trends</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>While it might seem extreme to pervasively apply these 
principles to the point of removing from programmers many of the decisions 
currently seen as important in application development, this approach to 
operating system design is really just an extrapolation of current trends. 
Throughout the history of computer science, advances in operating system and 
programming language design have raised the level of abstraction and removed 
control from application programmers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This trend is inevitable. It is driven by the continuing 
exponential increase in the performance of computing hardware. In any software 
project, there is a tradeoff between the amount of programming effort, the 
application functionality, and the resulting performance. Better hardware means 
that there is more performance available to be spent on increased functionality 
and reduced development cost. Furthermore, the relationship between more 
powerful abstractions and development cost is non-linear. It is hard to imagine 
any amount of engineering effort producing a system like today&#8217;s World Wide Web 
using only 1950&#8217;s software technology, even if it were running on modern 
hardware. (Admittedly, there are occasional setbacks to this trend in which 
people focus on bypassing abstractions for improved performance.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Many advances in operating systems and networking both 
demonstrate this trend and provide some technical underpinnings for another step 
forward. Distributed file systems [e.g.,&nbsp;Anderson et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96, 
Kistler&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Satya&nbsp;92] have succeeded in providing efficient 
location-transparent access to data. Some recent file system work 
[Wilkes&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96, Neefe&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96] focuses on 
auto-configuring and self-tuning for different loads. Network auto-configuration 
at the LAN level [Rodeheffer&nbsp;&amp; Schroeder&nbsp;91, Thomson&nbsp;&amp; 
Narten&nbsp;96] is increasingly possible. Distributed garbage collection remains 
a difficult problem, but progress is being made [Ferreira&nbsp;&amp; 
Shapiro&nbsp;94]. Systems for distributing parallel work now exist 
[Geist&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;94, Livny&nbsp;95].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Programming languages and compilers provide evidence of a 
similar evolution. What were once programmer decisions have increasingly been 
automated. Where once it was routine to write in assembly language, now in most 
cases a compiler for a higher level language like C++ does almost as well. 
Debugging, portability, and maintainability are improved, and the compiler is 
better able to analyze a myriad of details to optimize instruction selection and 
scheduling, register allocation and spilling, etc. Today, this trend is 
continuing with the popularity of easy-to-use environments like Java, Visual 
Basic, and Delphi. The emphasis in the tools industry is shifting from code 
efficiency to rapid application development with wizards that automatically 
generate scaffolding or framework code. Virtual machine environments with 
just-in-time compilation [Adl-Tabatabai&nbsp;96, Arnold&nbsp;&amp; 
Gosling&nbsp;96] extend the programmer&#8217;s insulation from processor architecture 
details, delaying that binding until run time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>What would such a system be like?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Given a distributed system with the properties described above, 
how might it function in practice? In this section, we present several scenarios 
that highlight the major aspects of our position.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>A New Machine</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>A user purchases and installs a new personal computer or 
workstation. The hardware vendor has done a good job with the cables and 
connectors, so plugging the system together is easy. The user plugs the power 
and network cables into the wall and flips the power switch. From the moment 
that a boot ROM, or perhaps a boot loader on disk, downloads code from the 
network, the new machine joins the Millennium system. The user has full access 
to Millennium with no human-managed configuration activities required. 
Millennium evaluates the hardware resources of the new computing device that it 
has acquired and starts to shift computations and data in response.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>A New Network</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>An administrator sets up a new office network. After connecting 
the various computers, links, and routers, the network is initially quiescent. 
The administrator inserts a Millennium installation DVD disk into one of the 
machines and the system propagates across the network. After evaluating the 
network topology and hardware resources, Millennium might suggest that one of 
the more powerful machines (a "server") be moved to a different network location 
for best performance. At some point, the administrator connects the office 
network to the Internet, and the office instantiation of the Millennium system 
merges with the worldwide system.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>Hardware Failure</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>An office computer goes down&#8212;perhaps a power supply has burned 
out. The Millennium system reconfigures around the missing machine. While the 
computer still ran, computations and data stored on it were either automatically 
replicated to other systems or logged so that they could be rerun or recomputed. 
At the time of the failure, Millennium identifies unique state that was not 
replicated and must be reconstructed and initiates those computations 
automatically. In general, users may detect a hesitation as the system moves or 
recreates data they attempt to access, but otherwise they are unaware of the 
change. An interactive user of the failed machine shifts to another machine and 
resumes work immediately or simply plugs in a replacement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>Web Service</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>A little-known web site suddenly achieves popularity, perhaps 
with a link from Cool Site of the Day<SUP>SM</SUP> or a mention in a prominent 
news story. Word of mouth spreads, and soon the web site&#8217;s servers are 
overwhelmed. Or rather, would have been overwhelmed except that heuristics in 
the Millennium system had noticed the new link and already started replicating 
the site for increased availability. Monitored traffic increases confirm the 
situation and soon the site&#8217;s data has been "pre-cached" across the Internet. As 
the site&#8217;s usage drops over the following weeks, Millennium reallocates 
resources to meet new demands.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>Distributed Programming</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Consider a simple fragment of pseudo-code:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>for (p = first(S); p not null; p = 
  next(S))<BR>if (p-&gt;age == 18 and p-&gt;height &lt; 6 and p-&gt;weight &lt; 
  180)<BR>count++;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>When executed in a distributed environment, the most efficient 
strategy for code like this is unclear: Should code or data be replicated or 
moved? Should loop iterations be executed in parallel? And what happens to error 
handling? In general, making such decisions requires knowledge of network and 
system parameters plus knowledge of current conditions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Millennium network operations intrinsically carry code to 
execute remotely, but the programmer does not deal with this explicitly. Instead 
the Millennium system automatically and dynamically exploits locality and 
concurrency opportunities. In the example code fragment, we believe that it is 
feasible for compiler techniques to identify the conditional test as code that 
should execute at the object </FONT><FONT face="Courier New" 
size=3>p</FONT><FONT size=2>&#8217;s location, in most circumstances. In more 
complicated scenarios, variations at run-time make it desirable to perform these 
optimizations dynamically or just-in-time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Related Work</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Several current projects share some of our goals or 
directions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The WebOS project [Vahdat&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96, 
Vahdat&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;97] addresses the goal of bringing distributed 
computing to the World Wide Web. The heart of the WebOS system is WebFS, a 
global file system. WebFS provides secure cache-coherent access to data. WebOS 
also includes a remote execution service. WebOS can be used to build highly 
available and self-tuning web services.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The Inferno&#8482; system [Lucent&nbsp;96] integrates an operating 
system and language environment with the goal of making it easier to create 
distributed services. Like Java [Arnold&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Gosling&nbsp;96], 
Inferno creates a virtual-machine environment for applications. However, Inferno 
also includes network protocols and services for distributed programming and a 
stand-alone implementation suitable for minimal hardware environments. (Sun is 
moving Java in this direction with the development of JavaOS 
[Mitchell&nbsp;96].)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The Globe project [Steen&nbsp;96, 
Homburg&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96] investigates distributed shared objects as a 
technique for building large-scale distributed systems. Local object 
representatives hide details like replication and mobility. Local objects have a 
standard internal structure that makes it easier to reuse code components. One 
of Globe&#8217;s major features is a hierarchical distributed location service that 
adapts dynamically to different usage patterns.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Legion [Grimshaw&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;97] proposes using an 
extensible object model to provide a single-system model for a worldwide network 
of computers. Legion emphasizes high-performance parallel computing. It supports 
legacy codes by encapsulating them in Legion-style object oriented wrappers. 
Legion automatically manages object replication and migration and supplies a 
single, persistent, global name space.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Conclusion</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>We have described our goals for a new distributed operating 
system. Improvements in hardware and networking technology, coupled with 
continuing operating system and programming language advances, enable the 
creation of an operating system that raises the level of abstraction presented 
to its applications. The operating system should provide seamless distribution, 
worldwide scalability, fault-tolerance, self-tuning, self-configuration, 
security, and resource controls.</FONT></P>
