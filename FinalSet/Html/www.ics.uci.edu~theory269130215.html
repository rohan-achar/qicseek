Criticality without frustration for quantum spin-1 chains
</h1>
<h2>

<p>
Frustration-free (FF) spin chains have a property that their ground
state minimizes all individual terms in the chain Hamiltonian. We ask
how entangled the ground state of a FF quantum spin-<i>s</i> chain with
nearest-neighbor interactions can be for small values
of&nbsp;<i>s</i>. While FF spin-1/2 chains are known to have unentangled
ground states, the case <i>s</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 remains less explored. We
propose the first example of a FF translation-invariant spin-1 chain
that has a unique highly entangled ground state and exhibits some
signatures of a critical behavior. The ground state can be viewed as the
uniform superposition of balanced strings of left and right parentheses
separated by empty spaces.  Entanglement entropy of one half of the
chain scales as (1/2)&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;O(1),
where <i>n</i> is the number of 2 spins. We prove that the energy gap
above the ground state is polynomial in 1/<i>n</i>. The proof relies on
a new result concerning statistics of Dyck paths which might be of
independent interest.
