Funny you should ask.

My great-aunt Ethel Blau passed away last Monday at 95.  On Wednesday her
remaining sister, Nedra Glasser, 84; Nedra's daughter, Abbe; and I buried
her at Mt. Hebron in Queens.  (Unfortunately it was the coldest day of the
week and had a biting wind to boot so it was a short ceremony.)

While we were there Abbe and I visited the office to see which other family
graves are in that cemetery and came up with quite a few in the Bnei Joseph
Degel area of Block 11, Path 14, Section 6.  I imagine that you have been
there.  Seeing so many Blaus, Dillers and Langsams side by side makes me
think that there probably is a real connection, but Nedra, 84, does not
really know what it is.

Anyway, what we particularly noted was the grave of a Gitel Blau.  Gitel is
Nedra's middle name.  I saw from your website that the name also occurs in
the Langsam family.

Abbe and I plan to return in the spring when it is warmer.

Do you have any information to share on Bnei Joseph Degel?

Thanks for keeping in touch!

Naomi

Your Langsam material is very impressive.  I wish I could tell you how I fit 
in but I don't know.  My great aunt says that there was a family named 
Langsam that she remembers from childhood and whom she believes were related 
to either the Blaus or the Dillers of Sanok, Galicia.  I will look through 
your material and see if I spot possible connections.
     
Thanks for writing to me!

Hi,
Wanted to touch base again. I know you were in contact with Suzan Wynne at
some point. I just wanted to flesh out what part of the tree you come from.
Can you target the two oldest generations of &quot;Langsam&quot; that you are aware
of?
Thanks!

We're not anywhere in particular yet.  You'll hear.
