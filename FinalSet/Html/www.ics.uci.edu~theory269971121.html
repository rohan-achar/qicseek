<h2>21 November 1997:<br>
Approximate Minimum Weight Triangulation of Convex Polygons<br>
Brad Hutchings, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p> Today in Theory Group, I'll be presenting a paper by
Levcopoulos and Krznaric that describes their heuristic for finding
a 1+e approximation of the minimum weight triangulation of convex
polygons in O(n) time. This result is theoretically quite practical
because it beats the best known exact algorithm's time of
O(n<sup>3</sup>) while not yielding a terribly bad triangulation.
Their result can be applied to speed up many heuristics for
triangulation of general point sets.</p>
