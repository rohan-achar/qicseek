<a href="http://www.drak.com/~david/">The Mathesons</a> had returned to 
Palo Alto in January after living in England and Boston, so we hadn't seen 
them for years.<br>
When they heard we were in town, they invited us over for 
a barbecue with some other old friends.<br>
I hadn't intended to take any 
photos, but it turned out David had also recently gotten a digicam,<br>
so of course we had to take them out and compare...
