The repetitive processes of thought are not confined, however, to
matters of arithmetic and statistics.  In fact, every time one
combines and records facts in accordance with established logical
processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the
selection of the data and the process to be employed, and the
manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter
to be relegated to the machines.  Not so much has been done along
these lines, beyond the bounds of arithmetic, as might be done,
primarily because of the economics of the situation.  The needs of
business, and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the
advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as
production methods were sufficiently advanced.

<p>

With machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for
there was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of
manipulating data are a very small part of the population.  There are,
however, machines for solving differential equations - and functional
and integral equations, for that matter.  There are many special
machines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides.
There will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the
scientist and in small numbers.

<p>

If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of
arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical
world.  One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely
by the use of the mathematics of probability.  The abacus, with its
beads string on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration
and the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world;
and it was a useful tool - so useful that it still exists.

<p>

It is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting
machine.  It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the
future.  But even this new machine will not take the scientist where
he needs to go.  Relief must be secured from laborious detailed
manipulation of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to
free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed
transformations in accordance with established rules.  A mathematician
is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot.  He
is not even a man who can readily perform the transformation of
equations by the use of calculus.  He is primarily an individual who
is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and
especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the
manipulative processes he employs.

<p>

All else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as
confidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the
intricate mechanism under the hood.  Only then will mathematics be
practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics
to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry,
metallurgy, and biology.  For this reason there will come more
machines to handle advanced mathematics for the scientist.  Some of
them will be sufficiently bizarre to suit the most fastidious
connoisseur of the present artifacts of civilization.
