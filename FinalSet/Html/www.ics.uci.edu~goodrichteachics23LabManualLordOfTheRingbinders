<p class="title">Introduction</p>

<p>Consider a major Web site, such as <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>.  At any given time,
they're storing a tremendous amount of information, e.g., book
inventory, and making it available via the Web.  Further, the
information is fairly fluid; every minute, many thousands of requests
pour in, each causing information to be accessed, changed, added, or
deleted.</p>

<p>Companies like these store their information in <i>databases</i>.  A
database is a collection of data, which can be visualized as
a table consisting of
rows and columns.  
Each row corresponds to a <i>data record</i> and reach column
corresponds to an <i>attribute</i> that the data can have.
For example, in a database of books, each data record (row)
would correspond to an individual book, and each attribute (column)
would correspond to an attribute that a book can have, such as its
author, title, or ISBN number.
In the case of books, the ISBN is a <i>unique</i> attribute, which is
different for each book.
In particular, each ISBN number contains a prefix that identifies the
originating country and publisher, and additional digits that
uniquely identify the book.
Thus, one could enumerate all books for a certain country or
publisher just by reporting all the data records (rows) in a book
database that have ISBN numbers with a certain prefix.

</div>

<div class="section">

<hr />

<p class="title">Tables, rows, and columns</p>

<p>For the purposes of this project, our <i>database</i> 
is a collection of <i>records</i>, each of which corresponds to a book.  
Each book record consists of five attributes, as shown below:
</p>

<table class="normal">
  <tr class="top">
    <td>ISBN Number (key)</td>
    <td>Author(s)</td>
    <td>Title</td>
    <td>Publisher</td>
    <td>Year</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0471128457</td>
    <td>Schneier, Bruce</td>
    <td>Applied Cryptography</td>
    <td>John Wiley & Sons</td>
    <td>1996</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0471469831</td>
    <td>Goodrich, M., and Tamassia, R.</td>
    <td>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</td>
    <td>John Wiley & Sons</td>
    <td>2004</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0618517650</td>
    <td>Tolkien, J.R.R.</td>
    <td>The Lord of the Rings</td>
    <td>George Allen & Unwin</td>
    <td>1954</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Importantly, one of the attributes (i.e., a column) 
contains a <i>key</i> value, which
is used to uniquely identify the record.
No two records will
ever have the same key.</p>

<p class="title">The program</p>

<p>Your program for this project is not intended to be
anywhere near a production-quality database management system (DBMS).  
Many of the ideas that I've
introduced above are simply to provide you enough background to
understand the larger context into which your work fits.  Your program
will be a prototype of a very simple database system, capable of
storing book data, searching that data by keys,
updating that data, and removing it.  
For simplicity, all of the data
will be character strings.  
</p>

<p>Your program will read a sequence of commands from the console
(presumably using a BufferedReader wrapped around an InputStreamReader
wrapped around System.in) and print output to System.out as directed by
the specification below.  Your program should <i>not</i> print out any
prompts such as "Please enter your next command."  It should simply
read commands blindly typed into the console, process them, and produce
output.  Many of the commands, in fact, will produce no output.  The
reason for this design decision is two-fold.  Firstly, this is intended
to be a prototype, meaning that it's not intended to be used by anyone
who is not familiar with the details of the project, so the user
interface need not be all that friendly.  Secondly, directly reading
commands from the console allows us to redirect input from a file into
the program, then redirect output into another file, for ease of
automated testing.  (I'll talk more about this aspect of the project
later in the write-up.)</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<hr />

<p class="title">The commands</p>

<p>Your program needs to support the following commands:</p>

<table class="normal">
  <tr class="top">
    <td>Command</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>INSERT</b> - Inserts a new book record into your database,
      with the given ISBN key and the required data values.  
      </p>

      <p><pre>INSERT <i>ISBNKey</i> author="<i>authorName</i>" title="<i>bookTitle</i>" publisher="<i>publisherName</i>" year=<i>yearValue</i> </pre></p>
      <p>
      where all of the fields are character strings, even the ones
      not in quotes (quotes cannot be used inside names or titles)
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><pre>INSERT 0471469831 author="Goodrich, M., and Tamassia, R." title="Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" publisher="John Wiley & Sons" year=2004</pre>
        <li><pre>INSERT 0618517650 author="Tolkien, J.R.R." title="The Lord of the Rings" publisher="George Allen & Unwin" year=1954</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>This command should generate no output.  
      The value placed into the ISBN key attribute must be unique in the database (i.e. no book may already exist with that value for is
      ISBN key).  
      </p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>LOOKUP</b> - Retrieves all the books in the database having
      a specified prefix in their ISBN keys, ordered by ISBN keys.</p>
      <p><pre>LOOKUP <i>ISBNPrefix</i></pre> </p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><pre>LOOKUP 0471</pre></li>
	<p>Looks up and prints the attributes of all books whose ISBN
	key has the prefix 0471 (which corresponds to the publisher
	John Wiley & Sons).</p>
      <p>The above command should generate output that looks like this:</p>
      <p> 
<pre>
0471128457 author="Schneier, Bruce" title="Applied Cryptography" publisher="John Wiley & Sons" year=1996
0471469831 author="Goodrich, M., and Tamassia, R." title="Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" publisher="John Wiley & Sons" year=2004
</pre>
        <li><pre>LOOKUP 0618517650</pre></li>
	<p>Looks up and prints the attributes of all books whose ISBN
	key has the prefix 0618517650 (which corresponds to the one Tolkien
	book).
	</p>
      <p>The above command should generate output that looks like this:</p>
<pre>
0618517650 author="Tolkien, J.R.R." title="The Lord of the Rings" publisher="George Allen & Unwin" year=1954
</pre>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <p>This command should print all the retrieved 
      book records as space-delimited
      lists of key-value pairs, ordered by their ISBN keys.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>DELETE</b> - Removes a book record with a particular key.</p>
      <p><pre>DELETE <i>ISBNKey</i></pre></p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><pre>DELETE 0471128457</pre>
	Deletes the book record with ISBNKey 
        equal to 0471128457, that is, the "Applied Cryptography" book.
      </ul>
      <p>This command should generate no output, unless the desired
      record is not present (in which case the output should simply
      be ERROR.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>EXIT</b> - Exits the program.</p>
      <p><pre>EXIT</pre></p>
      <p>This command should generate no output, and should end the program immediately.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

<p class="title">Handling erroneous commands</p>

<p>Since your program is intended to be a rudimentary prototype, it
need not report specific error messages to indicate specific problems.
Instead, any command that is not understood or does not follow the
rules above should cause your program to simply print the word "ERROR"
by itself on a line.  
</p>

</div>

<p class="title">Implementing the Database</p>

<p>You can think of our database as
a data structure that is commonly called a <i>map</i>.
A map is a set of key/value pairs,
where each key uniquely identifies a particular value.  In our case, we
can conceptually think of each record in the table as a key/value pair,
where the key is the string value of the ISBN key for that record, and the
value is the set of values for the remaining attributes.</p>

<p>Since our database may contain a very large collection of
book records, it will be necessary for us to build an efficient implementation,
which will provide fast insertions, lookups, and deletions.
For this project, you <b>must</b> implement the database as a
random <b><i>skip list</i></b>, ordered by ISBN keys.
Because it is fundamentally necessary to have your skip list working before
you can build any of the other pieces, you should write and test this
part of your project before moving on to the rest.

<p class="title">Redirection of input and output</p>

<p>Recall that you can execute a Java program from the command line by using the <b>java</b> command, like this:</p>

<pre>
java MyProgram
</pre>

<p>where MyProgram is the name of the class that contains a main( ) method.  Ordinarily, a Java program reads its "standard" input from the console, and writes its "standard" output to the console.  In other words, when you use the System.out.println( ) method, the output goes to the console.</p>

<p>Most operating systems -- Windows, Unix, and Linux, for example -- allow you to <i>redirect</i> the standard input and output when you execute a program.  The contents of an existing file may be redirected into the standard input, meaning that, rather than allowing the user to type input into the console, the program proceeds as though the user has typed the next line of the file each time the program requires input.  Similarly, the standard output can be redirected into a file, meaning that all of the output to System.out will be stored in a file, rather than displayed on the console.</p>

<p>The typical mechanism for redirection is to use the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operator on the command line, like this:</p>

<pre>
java MyProgram &lt;my-input.txt &gt;my-output.txt
</pre>

<p>Using the command above, every time the program needs input, it will read it from the file <b>my-input.txt</b>.  Every time it writes output, it will write it to the file <b>my-output.txt</b>.  It is possible to redirect the standard input without redirecting the standard output, and vice versa.  Note that the operating system deals with the <b>&lt;my-input.txt</b> and <b>&gt;my-output.txt</b> arguments itself before executing the program, so these will not end up in the array of Strings passed to the main( ) method.  In fact, the Java program will not even be aware of the redirection!  As far as the program is concerned, it's reading input from the console and writing output to the console.  The operating system handles the redirection transparently.</p>

<p>This powerful and simple technique will allow you to write test input and reuse it many times while testing this program, so that you can test your database with large sets of data.</p>

<p class="title">Deliverables</p>

<p>You must turn in all of the <b>.java</b> files.
Please do not include any <b>.class</b> files or other files
generated by your development environment.

<p class="title">Limitations and advice</p>

<p>You may not use the predefined Java "collection" classes, such as java.util.TreeMap, in your solution.  (The "collection" classes are the ones that store a collection of data, and include such classes as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Vector, Hashtable, and TreeMap.)</p>

<p>I can't stress enough the need to <i>start early</i>.  The previous two projects involved a lot of conceptual thinking, but not very much coding.  This project, on the other hand, will require you to write more code.  It's actually not as big as you may believe, but I would allocate plenty of time to work on it, so that you can get your questions answered early on, and still have plenty of time to write the code.</p>
