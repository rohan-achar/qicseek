<h3>
Due in Class/Discussion Two Weeks from your Prototype Demonstration Date</h3>

<h4>
Assignment Requirements</h4>
This assignment consists of two parts: 1) an update to the requirements
document (see below) and 2) an in-class presentation on the design. The
in-class presentations will begin on March 2.
<h4>
Purpose and Content</h4>
The Requirements Document focused on <b>what </b>your system will do.&nbsp;
The design document describes <b>how</b> it will be done, giving the overall
picture of how your system is organized.
<p>The design document should also be an evolving document, or a living
document.&nbsp; You should begin by documenting the conceptual model of
your system.&nbsp; As you continue working, this model will be refined
to include more detail, and some things will change.&nbsp; By the time
you turn in your design document, it should contain a reasonably accurate
description of your final system.&nbsp; You will also be asked to turn
in a final version of the document at the end of the quarter that will
include changes made to the requirements and design during the later stages
of implementation.
<p>The design document will consist of the following sections.&nbsp; Sections
1-4 and 8-13 are updates of what you turned in for the Requirements Document.&nbsp;
The remaining sections, 5-7 and 14, are new to the Design Document.
<ol>
<li>
<b>Title Page</b></li>

<li>
<b>Summary</b></li>

<li>
<b>Glossary</b></li>

<li>
<b>Use Cases, Scenarios, Mock-up's</b></li>

<br>(whichever you focused on in Assignment 2)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Architecture Overview</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Architectural Style</li>

<br>What style of architecture did you adopt? Provide a reference to a
defining document.
<p>Shaw and Garlan have identified the following list of architectural
styles:
<p>&nbsp; 1.Data Flow Style
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Batch Sequential
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pipes and Filters
<br>&nbsp; 2.Call and Return Style
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Program and Subroutines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hierarchical layers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object-oriented (client/server)
<br>&nbsp; 3.Independent Components
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicating processes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event systems
<br>&nbsp; 4.Virtual Machines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule-based systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpreters
<br>&nbsp; 5.Data-Centered Systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transactional Database Systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackboard Systems
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
System Architecture Overview</li>

<br>This is the place for your "one great diagram" that shows how your
system is built. You might want to use more than one diagram, to show,
e.g., some different abstractions of the design (such as a data flow view,
a layers of abstraction view, an object view, or an OS process view)
<li>
Subsystem Narrative</li>

<br>What each subsystem means
<li>
Major limitations on the current design</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Modules Specification</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
List of Modules within your system</li>

<li>
For each module, provide a Module Specification</li>

<ul>
<li>
Name</li>

<li>
Definition/Purpose - what it is/does</li>

<li>
Narrative/Comment - how it works</li>

<li>
What are the interfaces or APIs? E.g., using Java terminology</li>

<br>public
<br>private
<br>protected
<li>
Data - What state does it keep, what variables?</li>

<li>
Access - Who has access to the module/object/data?</li>

<li>
How does it fit into the inheritance/with/uses heirarchy?</li>

<li>
Constraints - what constraints are there for this object/module?</li>

<li>
Cardinality - How many will there be?</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Team Specific diagrams</b></li>

<br>See your TA but likely notations include Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams
for Database Projects, UML Sequence Diagrams for the Error Injection Projects
<li>
<b>Deliverables</b></li>

<li>
<b>Delivery Platform</b></li>

<li>
<b>Terms and Authorization</b></li>

<li>
<b>Development Platform.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Milestones and Effort</b></li>

<br>Provide milestones and effort in a tabular or bulleted form. Show former
estimates of time next to current estimates (or actual time in the case
of achieved milestones). This will enable you to recognize shortcomings
of your own ability to estimate and the difficulty in general of estimations.
<li>
<b>Acceptance Test Plan</b></li>

<br>To be more specific in the update of your Acceptance Test Plan, create
a script (2-4 pages) of your intended final presentation. The script may
be in the form of an outline or bulleted list. In some cases, it will be
close to your prototype demonstration. It should tell a choherent and convincing
story that will make your client enthusiastic about signing off on your
project!
<br>You may refer to figures in other parts of your document such as use
cases and / or mock-up's.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Unit and Integration Test Plans</b></li>

<br>Enumerate several key tests for evaluating individual modules and combinations
of modules in your system.
<br>For each test
<ul>
<li>
Test ID</li>

<li>
Purpose of Test</li>

<li>
Item(s) being tested</li>

<li>
Input specification or specific data being tested</li>

<li>
Output specification</li>

<ul>
<li>
Expected Results or Test Oracle Mechanism</li>
</ul>

<li>
Test environmental needs or special test procedures</li>
</ul>
</ol>
