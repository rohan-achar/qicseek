<h2>General Course Information</h2>

<p>Coursework will consist of biweekly homeworks, including a
homework due in finals week. There will be no exams. Group work on
homeworks is permitted; each student should turn in his or her own
copy of the homeworks. The course texts will be <i>Network
Flows</i> (Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin) and <i>Graph Drawing</i> (Di
Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and Tollis). The course meets Tuesdays
and Thursdays, 2:00 - 3:20 in ICF 101.</p>
