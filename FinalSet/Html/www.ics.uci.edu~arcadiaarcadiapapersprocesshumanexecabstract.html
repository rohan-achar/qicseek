"<b>Human-Executed Operations in the Teamware Process Programming
System</b>"</A>,

<H2> Abstract </H2>

The Teamware process programming system is designed to support the
coordination and control of software engineering teams.  In a
traditional computer language the program is executed by the computer.
In contrast, in Teamware the process program is primarily exeucted by
humans.  The Teamware interpreter supports execution by keeping team
members informed of their work assignments, by providing access to
information on the context of individual work assignments, and by
coordinating transfer of artifacts and tools.  Providing a language
for specifying processes executed by humans rather than computers has
profound implications on language design.  This paper identifies key
requirements on languages and systems designed to specify and support
human-executed processes.  It then discusses how Teamware addresses
these requirements.  The paper concludes with a brief discussion of
validation exerciese performed on Teamware and with a short comparison
to related research.
