<span><p>Effective use of sensor data is critical to the fruition of "embodied virtuality", first envisioned by Mark Weiser in Computing for the 21st Century.  Realistically speaking, however, we are far from the point where sensor based computation has seamlessly integrated with either the physical or social worlds, if such integration is even possible.  The current physical world is one with gaps in the computational infrastructure, heterogeneous hardware platforms, and emergent situations that cause sensor breakdown.  The current social world is one where issues of privacy and security complicate the use of sensor data in a pervasive manner.</p>
<p>SALi, short for Sensor Abstraction Layer, is a unique sensor framework written in Java that is designed to operate with the expectation of these pressing issues.  Acting as a nervous system for sensor based computation, SALi fills the gap of responsibility between sensors and the applications that use them, providing services such as graceful degradation in the event of sensor failure and end user transparency. At a high level, SALi uses a plug-in based architecture for integrating hardware sensors and a feed based mechanism for requesting sensor data over TCP/IP.  This allows SALi to create one to one, one to many, many to one, or many to many associations between sensors and the applications that use them.  SALi also provides a dashboard view of sensor activity, so that users can deal with privacy and security issues from an in context perspective.</p>
<p>The intent of SALi is to ease the development of sensor based applications by abstracting away both technical and social sensor management issues.   By decoupling the client application from sensor management, by creating a uniform interface for receiving sensor data, and by empowering users to take control of the manner in which sensors transmit data, hopefully SALi can advance the testing and development of sensor based applications.</p></span>
