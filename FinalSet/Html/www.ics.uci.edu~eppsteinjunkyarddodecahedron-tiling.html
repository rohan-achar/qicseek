</PRE><HR><PRE>
Just the usual regular dodecahedron, with 12 pentagonal faces.

There are 4 different pentagonal tetrominos that can be used to 
tile it. (As usual for these problems we don't consider reflected
tiles or tilings as different.)

Find a tiling that uses (a) 3 tetrominos of the same type;
find "    "     "    "  (b) "      "      " different types.

Not especially hard, but each solution is unique, which is amusing.
