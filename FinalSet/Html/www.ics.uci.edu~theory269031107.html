Envy-Free Auctions for Digital Goods

<p>
The authors study auctions in unlimited supply.  They show that no
constant-competitive truthful auction is envy-free.  They also show that
by relaxing the problem to instead being truthful with small probability
of being envy-free, or vice versa, auctions can be competitive.  
<p>
Definitions:
<p>
<I>Truthful</I>:  any bidder's best strategy is to bid the maximum value they are
willing to pay
<br>
<I>Envy-Free</I>:  after the auction is run, no bidder would be happier with the
outcome of another bidder
