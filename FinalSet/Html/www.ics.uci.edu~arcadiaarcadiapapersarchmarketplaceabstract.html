"<b>Software Architecture: Foundation of a Software Component 
Marketplace</b>"</A>,
by E. James Whitehead Jr, and Jason E. Robbins, Nenad Medvidovic,

for Software Systems</i>, Seattle WA, April 24-25, 1995.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

This paper provides a characterization of software architectures which
become the foundation for the establishment of marketplaces for
software components. A description is made of a framework of key
properties that a software architecture should exhibit to be the basis
of a component marketplace. As examples of existing software component
marketplaces, Unix filter and Visual Basic VBX marketplaces are
examined with respect to this framework. The Chiron-2 architectural
style is analyzed with respect to these properties to determine its
potential as a future software component marketplace in the user
interface domain.
