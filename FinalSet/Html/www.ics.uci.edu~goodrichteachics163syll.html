<ul>
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks,
two midterms, and a comprehensive final exam. The overall grade
will be determined 20% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and
30% from the final.
Group work on homeworks is permitted, but each
student must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
Late homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>
</li>

<li><b>Exam policy.</b>
Exam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration
is allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams 
will be considered cheating.
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a 
failing grade in the class.
