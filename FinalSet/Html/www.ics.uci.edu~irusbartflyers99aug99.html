The software industry has evolved at a very rapid pace in the last two
decades.  Many architecures, frameworks and platforms have served the
changing appetite for developing innovative software products targeted
for
horizontal as well as vertical market segments.  With the increasing
popularity of web-based internet software solutions a whole new set of
architectures, tools and components have emerged.  Often it is very
challenging as to what development, deployment, management and
integration
environment to embrace in order to support your architectural evolution.
There are at the minimum UNIX and Microsoft Windows camps.  The speaker
will
leverage his multi-platform experience with the operating systems,
distributed systems management, client-server applications,
datawarehousing,
and the internet software to share valuable insights into the direction
of
distributed software development.
 
<p>
<strong>Biography:</strong>
Mr. Tandon is the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology
Officer of MirrorPlus Technologies, a silicon valley Internet and
E-commerce
software start up. He has over 20 years of software engineering and
senior
management experience at well-known computer and software companies
including Hewlett-Packard, Amdahl, Unison Software (acquired by IBM)
and
Prism Solutions (acquired by Ardent Software). He has successfully led
the
architecture, design and development of several highly innovative
systems
software, client-server applications, datawarehousing, and Internet
software
projects. Mr. Tandon holds an M.S. in Computer Engineering from Case
Western
Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio and an M.Sc. in Physics from
Indian
Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India.

<em>
Practical Considerations for Deploying a Java Active Networking
Platform<br>

Active networks enable the introduction of user computing to network
devices to provide new and improved services and distributed
application functionality. Traditional networks deliver packets
between endpoints employing congestion control, output queue
scheduling, and routing protocol software which is bundled with the
hardware and does not support user customization or introduction of
new software protocols.
<p>
We discuss the real-world issues involved in safely and concurrently
running multiple non-interfering services on a Gigabit router using
Java as the platform for network programming.  The Active Networking
Working Group describes NodeOS, a model for providing active nodes on
a network with a resource manager to control the allocation of system
resources such as memory, CPU cycles, persistent storage, and access
to IO bandwidth.  We discuss the difficuties of providing resource
management within the Java framework.

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Robert F. Jaeger received the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
(Cum Laude) from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University in Blacksburg, VA.  He received an M.S. in Computer Science
from the John Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD and is writing his
dissertation in the area of Active Networking at the University of
Maryland, College Park.  Since 1987 Mr. Jaeger has been working with
communications networks including controlling equipment remotely over
HBIB, simulating networks, and building and verifying operation of ATM
and high performance IP and Optical Networks.  His main areas of
interest are networking and protocols. He is currently involved in
projects to provide QoS to IP networks, including experimenting with
IP Telephony.  The application of Active Networking is being
investigated as well as how to build an active networking platform on
which application services can be run.
