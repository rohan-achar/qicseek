Flipping Edges in Triangulations<br>
Jason Cahill, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

This talk is based on a paper by F. Hurtado, M. Noy, and J.
Urrutia, from Computational Geometry '96. This paper covers three
problems, so I plan on covering two of them in detail, and showing
some examples of the other. 

<p>In this paper we study the problem of flipping edges in
triangulations of polygons and point sets. We prove that if a
polygon Qn has k reflex vertices, then any triangulation T of Qn
can be transformed to another triangulation T' of Qn by flipping at
most O(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;k<sup>2</sup>) edges. We produce examples of
polygons with triangulations T and T' such that to transform T to
T' requires O(n<sup>2</sup>) flips. These results are then extended
to triangulations of point sets. We also show that any
triangulation of an n point set contains at least
(n&nbsp;-&nbsp;4)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 edges that can be flipped.</p>
