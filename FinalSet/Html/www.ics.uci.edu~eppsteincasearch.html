    <h1><span>Life Search Programs</span></h1>

    <p><span>It is possible to find small but interesting patterns
    in Life just by trying random seed patterns, or by manually
    setting up glider crashes, etc. But many lifenthusiasts have
    written search programs to aid in finding larger patterns. It
    may be more productive to write your own programs than to run
    the ones listed here, since that way you're more likely to find
    something nobody else could have found. But, sometimes there's
    already an available tool for what you want, and anyway it's
    hard to be original without knowing what's already been
    done.</span></p>

    <p><span>This page is intended as a catalog of these search
    programs: who wrote them, how do they work, what can they find,
    and how can one obtain them? I'm including even unobtainable
    programs here, for historical purposes and since it may be
    useful to have a description of their design
    principles.</span></p>

       <i>Description:</i> Forms seed patterns by setting cells on
      or off randomly within a small rectangular block in a larger
      field. If evolution of a seed reaches the field boundary, the
      resulting pattern is recentered and evolved again. Patterns
      that reach the boundary a second time are saved as possible
      gliders. Used by Bays to find gliders in several
      three-dimensional and triangular-lattice cellular
      automata.</span></dd>

      using a data structure to make sure that the placement will
      not interfere with previous steps of the
      reaction.</span></dd>

       <i>Description:</i> Searches for patterns consisting of a
      small perturbation "drifting" across a still-life background.
      Takes as input the perturbation and part of the background.
      Depth-first; simulates the evolution of the perturbation,
      making a choice whenever it needs the value of an unknown
      background cell, and backtracking whenever it finds an
      inconsistency in the background or the perturbation grows too
      large. Useful for finding high-period billiard-table
      oscillators, circuitry consisting of signals moving through
      static wires and components, and custom eaters.</span></dd>

      results in the same rows. Uses a fixed amount of depth-first
      lookahead per node to limit the breadth first queue size.
      Includes modes for finding symmetric patterns. Life evolution
      rule is hardcoded as a sequence of bit-parallel integer
      operations, multiple times throughout 25 pages of uncommented
      C (so not really possible to change without rewriting the

       <i>Description:</i> Depth first search for low-period
      spaceships. Extends partial patterns a column at a time,
      keeping track of columns in a single phase of the pattern. At
      each level of search, tries all possible choices for the next
      column, and for each choice performs the evolution rule p
      times on the last 2p+1 columns (where p is the desired
      period). If the result of the evolution matches a shifted
      copy of the original middle column, the search continues
      recursively. Stops and outputs a successful spaceship when
      the result of the evolution matches not just the middle
      column but also all later columns. Life evolution rule is
      hardcoded but only in a small number of easy to change
      lines.</span></dd>

      still lifes with up to 20 live bits. Design principles
      unknown. Niemiec apparently also wrote a brute force search
      program, which finds all oscillators or spaceships that fit
      in a given area (5x5 taking a few days as of 1994) based on a
      principle attributed by him to Raynham of simultaneously
      running two copies, one twice as fast as the other, and
      detecting when both reach the same state. (The same principle
      has been discovered by many other workers in other areas e.g.
      the Pollard rho factoring algorithm.).</span></dd>
