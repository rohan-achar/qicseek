They had 7 known children. Chaim Leib was able to obtain some land which he farmed successfully. This enabled him to further increase his holdings. and become known as a <i>gentleman</i> farmer. Of note is the fact that quite a few of his grandchildren bore the names of the <i>Bnei Yissoschur</i>, Tzvi Elimelech, and his wife, Chana Mindel. Perhaps Chaim Leib's wife was a descendant (daughter or granddaughter).</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
