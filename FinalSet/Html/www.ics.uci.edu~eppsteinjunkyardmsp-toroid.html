&gt;I once built models of all eight convex polyhedra composed entirely of

A related question that has bothered me for many years is whether it is 
possible to build a toroidal polyhedron out of equilateral triangles,
with six triangles at each vertex.

I suspect not but have been unable to settle it.

A similar question arises if the restriction to "six triangles at each vertex"
is removed. This seems likely to be true.
