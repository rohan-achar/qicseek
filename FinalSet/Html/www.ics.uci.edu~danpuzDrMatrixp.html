P   One can't help but wonder how some famous people
    might be in different careers if only they paid attention to anagrams.  For
    instance, Julie Andrews might have been a vagrant, as her last name is an
    anagram of WANDERS.  Can you match the celebrities on the left to their
    destined professions on the bottom? (A hint is available at location D.)
