<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due by noon on Wednesday,
February 25.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>You will do the main part of this assignment
(Part I) with the partner you chose at the end of the previous assignment.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part I</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>In the previous assignment, you identified
three applications that perform the same function.  For this part, pick
a single task (e.g., starting a new game, or setting the user preferences,
or initiating a chat with someone on the buddy list) that each application
performs with mouse or pointer movements.  (If there is no common task in
your applications that&#39;s pointer-based, talk to us right away to work
out an alternative.)  Try to identify a task that takes four or five different
movements, on the average.  (This is a rough guideline; don&#39;t pick a
task that requires a single click in every application and don&#39;t pick
one that requires a dozen steps, either.)  If you have difficulty identifying
an appropriate task, send Email to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="mailto:ics104@uci.edu">ics104@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Which of the three applications
lets the user perform the task most quickly?  Consider everything--recognition
time, movement time, anything else.  Which application makes the task slowest?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>(You&#39;ll need to decide on the characteristics
of the hypothetical user you&#39;re talking about here--beginning or experienced,
old or young or in between, whatever characteristics are relevant--and keep
those assumptions constant throughout.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Produce illustrations of the steps involved,
with the movements marked.  Describe and explain your conclusions in at
most half a (single-spaced) page (not counting the illustrations).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Use Fitts&#39; Law (P = C1 + C2
(log2(2D/W))) to analyze the speed of performing the task on each system.
 For each step in the task, measure the distance and the target size and
apply the formula.  You&#39;ll have to make some assumptions and adopt some
conventions (Is W the width of the target or its area?  Will you use inches,
centimeters, or pixels as your unit?  What&#39;s the user&#39;s starting
point at the beginning of the task?); just keep those decisions consistent
as you analyze the three systems so your results should be valid for comparison
purposes, even if the numbers might need some scaling to produce actual
times.  Don&#39;t bother with the constants C1 or C2, either.  (If there&#39;s
some reason that you think your systems aren&#39;t comparable in this way,
talk to us.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Show your calculations and analysis (probably
a spreadsheet would be best, with a row for each step in the process), keyed
to the illustrations in part <B>(a)</B>.  State clearly what results this
analysis produced.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B>  Did your Fitts&#39; Law analysis
of part <B>(b)</B> reach the same conclusion as your holistic analysis of
part <B>(a)</B>?  Unless the results were identical in every respect, describe
and explain the differences.  (Half a page is the maximum here.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B>  Take your best-performing application
and redesign the screen(s) for the task you analyzed to make that task even
faster.  (If you think your winning application is perfect, choose one of
the other applications and redesign it to improve it, maintaining consistency
with the rest of the original application (i.e., don&#39;t just redesign
it to look like the winner).)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d.1)</B>  Sketch out your redesign on
paper.  You and your partner should each walk through the redesign, looking
for problems and making improvements.  There&#39;s nothing to turn in for
this part.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d.2)</B>  After you&#39;re satisfied with
your redesign, create a mock-up using a WYSIWYG GUI builder (e.g., Visual
Basic, Visual C++, Dreamweaver (for web pages), Interface Builder or OmniGraffle
(on the Mac)).  Some of these tools are available on the lab machines or
for free trial download.  You just need to show the new screen(s); you don&#39;t
need to implement the functionality.  This is a mock-up, not a polished
design, so don&#39;t spend more than an hour or two putting this together.
 Incorporate your finished illustrations into the electronic document that
you turn in.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d.3)</B>  Describe your redesign and explain
how it improves the original.  (Half a page maximum.)</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Combine all your answers into one electronic
document and submit it via Checkmate.  (The guidelines about hand-drawn
illustrations also apply.)  Just one member of your group should submit
the work, but of course both group members&#39; names must appear clearly
in the body of the assignment itself.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Download and install the program
Denim, from the Berkeley Group for User Interface Research (</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://guir.berkeley.edu/projects/denim/">http://guir.berkeley.edu/projects/denim/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>).
 Spend a few minutes reading about Denim on their web page, viewing one
of the introductory videos there, and playing around with the program itself.
 Skim through the tutorial that comes with the software, but don&#39;t go
through it in detail at this point.</FONT></P>
