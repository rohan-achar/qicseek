Smooth Orthogonal Layouts
</h1>
<h2>

<p>
We study the problem of creating smooth orthogonal layouts for planar
graphs. While in traditional orthogonal layouts every edge is made of a
sequence of axis-aligned line segments, in smooth orthogonal layouts
every edge is made of axis-aligned segments and circular arcs with
common tangents. Our goal is to create such layouts with low edge
complexity, measured by the number of line and circular arc segments.
We show that every biconnected 4-planar graph has a smooth orthogonal
layout with edge complexity 3. If the input graph has a complexity-2
traditional orthogonal layout, we can transform it into a smooth
complexity-2 layout. Using the Kandinsky model for removing the
degree restriction, we show that any planar graph has a smooth
complexity-2 layout.
