&gt;Most of these are OK, but "Stableness of versions" is a repository

  It seems to me that the desire that a <em>versioned</em> URL be stable is
inherent to the notion of versioning, and can be a protocol requirement
(ie. assumption that users of the protocol are entitled to make). However,
since URLs are not guaranteed to be stable, we still have a problem,
because if the base URL is re-used, the versions should obviously not have
to be persistent. Perhaps we can simply say "If the document addressed by a
base URL (we don't have a proper name for this concept) remains the same,
then the versions of that document will be stable.

   I think this is important, as a stability guaranteee (even a weak one)
allows versioning to be used to provide intelligent caching, distribution,
and so on. And a server implementer is free to strengthen the guarantee if
they want to, by <em>not</em> re-using base URLs.
