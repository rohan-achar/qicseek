			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Status:<br />
</strong>We have a working local application that can function with our desired methods and has great translate functionality and adding objects interface. The client-server, which has been a problem since the beginning, continues to be a problem til the last day. We are still researching the code to implement the code and send the involved clients updated files successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:<br />
</strong>We have been working like crazy today to finish all the debugging of the client-server. We finished the powerpoint presentation as well as the documentation and the document with all the information (team members, inspiration, programming languages used, etc.). The debugging took up the majority of the time as a basic semi-functioning application was working yesterday. Today we tried to debug for over 7 hours and it was exhausting, exhilaration, and annoying. We were working on ID&#8217;s of objects, sending objects to users, and adding users. We wrapped up well and are awaiting tomorrow for our presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges:<br />
</strong>The biggest challenge was and always will be the very complicated server-client relationship. It is very difficult to send users specific data. The database had to be updated accordingly and this was a difficult thing to manage. It is apparent that this needs focused time and research. Finally, we are working on a presentation for tomorrow.<strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
We currently have a working application locally. It creates objects and allows text, and the objects connect to one another as desired for the application. The GUI is completely done and it is working well with the touch interface and tapping. We have figured out the way to do the Client-Server and pushing notifications using XMPP and PHP.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:<br />
</strong>We spent hours and hours today spending time on figuring out the XMPP and PHP coding in order to send notification to the clients once a map was updated. We needed to implement a method that would send a new map to all involved clients and not just all the clients that are registered with the map. This proved to be difficult as well as we have a SQL server that is storing all the data in terms of ID, Title, and JSON Information. This Data all needed to be received and sent and the code for this written in PHP. We worked on this for greater part of the day as well as the Android based code.<strong></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:<br />
</strong>We have completed the greater part of the project and are prepared for the due date tomorrow. We are half way through the document and have created a great powerpoint document. The application itself needs some PHP and Android coding to interact with the client-server but this is minimal. We need to fix some minor bugs and work on efficiency tomorrow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong>The main part of the app is complete, and works quite nicely on Android. The whole team is now shifting focus to the sharing/social feature of the application. We have made a module design for the sharing/social feature.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met in the Courtyard Study Lounge with most of the team. We implemented what was left of the GUI. The screen rotation bug was fixed that was created problems before  and the client side of the coding has begun. We researched the different options we have to implement our sharing/social feature, and eventually decided on one. We spent a lot of time in this research of sharing because we had to see the best way of pushing information to clients when the application data would be updated.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
A challenging aspect of our program was representing data on a server and being able to allow the client-server to communicate efficiently. Another challenge was with subversion conflicts, but that was quickly solved after a member stopped reformatting the braces. We are going to meet again tomorrow in the Couryard Lounge and work on setting up a client-server relationship with the updated data being sent immediately to the desired clients.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
We have a basic program implemented that compiles and works correctly, tested on Android 2.1 device and Android 4.0 device. We haven&#8217;t tested the connectivity with JSON or anything with the PHP server yet, but in terms of GUI we have made a major leap. We continue to search on going from Android to PHP and then sending data from the server to the Android device upon request.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:<br />
</strong>We met in the Science Library throughout the day with the entire team getting together starting at 3pm. We made some good research on the PHP and Android with HTTP Post. Also from the client, or Android side, some good information and implementation of using HTTP Post to get the data, then converting the stored JSON file and parsing it to fit the Android platform was found. The interface of the application itself was updated based on team collaboration and what would be least cumbersome for all users. A major accomplishment after hours and hours of research and debugging was the ability to draw shapes onto an infinitely “scrolling” canvas. The gradient and shadow effects were also coded. The actual send receiving of the file was further discussed in terms of updating files on the server and then resending to all users. We also looked into and found a solution to identify the identity of the Android device using email address.</p>

<a href='http://student-council.ics.uci.edu/appjam/winter2012/blog/index.php/day-5/imag0274/' title='IMAG0274'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://student-council.ics.uci.edu/appjam/winter2012/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMAG0274-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="IMAG0274" title="IMAG0274" /></a>

<p><strong>Challenges:<br />
</strong>While we have been researching and reading tutorials we are still trying to implement the JSON format and then actually implement it onto the server and back to the user. This will prove to be a difficult task as client-server things are never easy. The actual GUI is about complete but still needs a little bit of work. The program will deal with connected objects and notifying users of updates so the implementation of notifying users based on Android ID still needs to be researched. We are planning on meeting for the majority of the day on Saturday and hope to make a lot of progress individually as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong>We have been using Google Docs and created a Facebook Group in order to better communicate with each other on the progress of each team. Meeting in person has become difficult with the varying schedules and midterm week but through Facebook we can still maintain contact.  Our applications purpose and function has been decided and the purpose it will serve for the users is finalized, now we will have to work on implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today</strong>:<br />
The team could not get together today because of conflicting schedules but we resolved to meet on Friday and spend all weekend together. Today, individually, team members continued their research in order to facilitate the meetings over the weekend. The coding behind finger gestures as well as the different variations that will be possible in terms of touch screen and coding behind it was worked on. The application will be dependent on notifying specific users of any updates and the data will be on the server so the notification of client through C2DM was researched. The Post/Get for PHP was also researched. We also received confirmation of the creation of our webspace and access to MySQL from our Team Advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
We have to solidify our understanding of the PHP, C2DM, and Code implementation and we will work on that so that the weekend code session goes smoother. The Canvas and JSON is proving to be difficult but we are going to work long hours on Saturday and Sunday to hopefully have a finished project by Sunday night.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
We are still in research mode since several team members are still learning various different languages, like PHP and JSON. Meanwhile, others are trying to learn how to manually draw shapes and lines onto the screen. We already came up with the navigational flow of the app so we’ll try to stick to that plan as best as we can. We have subteams set up in order to most efficiently use the skills we all currently possess. The idea for the app is well thought out and now the implementation and coding of it is being strategized. There are many factors involved such as the Design, GUI Interface, Server synchronization, and programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.appjam.roboteater.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PHP.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-608" src="http://blog.appjam.roboteater.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PHP-300x133.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="133" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:<br />
</strong>Team members are reporting good progress after reading several tutorials on web server administration. After we get webspace, we hope we can start applying what we learned right away. Vincent tried to implement zoom and translate functionality but failed and will try another approach. Then, he will attempt to draw various shapes on to the screen. The PHP part of the application and what is required was studied and is ultimately finished. The echo command is a very useful command in PHP <img src='http://student-council.ics.uci.edu/appjam/winter2012/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . Various group members met throughout the day in the Science Library to brainstorm ideas on improvements and concerns. We also worked more on the coding and implementation of the base app. All team members installed Subclipse plugn as well as the AVD Device 4.0 to work on. Finally, we requested webspace to deploy PHP scripts which will be an integral part of our application.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
Currently designing the c2ddm implementation for our application is a challenge and will require some time and effort. The preliminary JSON format is still being decided. Also the actual implementation of the program, meaning the code, obviously is still being written and worked on. Zoom/translating a view is proving harder than we thought.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Current Project Status:<br />
We have developed an idea on a self-improving app. We are coordinating times on when to meet through Google Calendar and the invitation/event function of it.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
Today we met in Courtyard Study Lounge Room 12 at 3:30 PM and brainstormed on the implementation of the application. We figured out the framework and registered for Android Cloud to Device Messaging. We determined the basic interface required and the components of user to server, etc. After determining the basic interface, we further split up the main team into three smaller teams dealing with web server (php), Android to Network communication (C2DM), GUI interface (representation of objects). We have decided to use Subversion to work with version control and to share and synchronize our work.</p>

<p>Challengers:<br />
The teams will research on the designated topics and will collaborate with each other on the creation and attributes of objects and communication of data with server and client. The structure and attributes of object will be worked on. JSON will then be implemented. Work on PHP Hello World.</p>
