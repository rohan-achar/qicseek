An Optimal Randomized Algorithm for Maximum Tukey Depth
<br>
Kevin Wortman 
</h2>
<p>
We present the first algorithm to compute the maximum Tukey 
depth  for a non-degenerate point set in the plane.  The algorithm is 
randomized and requires <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) 
expected time for <i>n</i> data points.
In a higher fixed dimension <i>d</i>, greater than or equal to 3, 
the expected time bound is <i>O</i>(<i>n<sup>d-1</sup></i>), 
which is probably optimal as well.  The result is obtained using an 
interesting variant of the author's randomized optimization
technique, capable of solving "implicit" linear-programming-type problems.
