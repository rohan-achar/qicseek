<P><FONT SIZE="2">Note: Start this homework early. You may have to use the computers at school but you can download the free open-source Weka software</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2">Also read over all the questions before you start, otherwise you may have to repeat some experiments.</FONT></P>
<P>In this homework you will use the Weka software to analyze the iris data set, a standard data set used to evaluated statistical algorithms. This data set is provided with Weka. 
<P>For each of the algorithms below, report the accuracies using 2-fold and 10-fold
cross-validation. 
<ol>
<li> 
<ol>
<li> ZeroR which is the dumbest algorithm of all. It�s the baseline.</P>
<li>k-Nearest-Neighbor (Ibk) with k = 1, k=3, and k = 5. In the IBL folder.</P>
<li> j48: the decision tree algorithm. In the Trees folder.</P>
<li> Part: the algorithm for generating rules. In the Rules folder.</P>
<li> Na&iuml;ve Bayes: a statistical approach using Bayes Rule. In the Bayes folder</P>
</ol>
<li>
<OL Type="a" STYLE="List-Style-Type : Lower-Alpha">
    <LI>Do you expect that 2-fold or 10-fold CV will yield a <B>higher</B> estimate of the accuracy of the algorithm?
    <LI>Why?
    <LI>Does your data support this conclusion? Be specific.
    
</OL>
<li> Which learning methods produced interpretable results?
<li> From the 10-fold CV data, order the algorithms by accuracies. 
<li> For the remaining questions, only consider the decision tree algorithm with 10 fold CV. Report the confusion matrix for the decision tree algorithm
    <LI>List, in order, the classes predicted with highest precision, i.e. the probability that the example was
    of class &quot;a&quot; given that the algorithm predicted it was of class &quot;a&quot;. Show how the probabilities were computed.
    <LI>List, in order, the classes predicted with highest recall, i.e. the probability that the example was
    predicted to be of class &quot;a&quot; given that it was of class &quot;a&quot;. Show how the probabilities were computed.
