We study novel combinatorial properties of graphs that allow us to
devise a completely new approach to dynamic all pairs shortest paths
problems. Our approach yields a fully dynamic algorithm for general
directed graphs with non-negative real-valued edge weights that
supports any sequence of operations in
<I>O</I>(<I>n</I><sup>2</sup>poly(log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)) amortized
time per update and unit worst-case time per distance query, where n
is the number of vertices. We can also report shortest paths in
optimal worst-case time. These bounds improve substantially over
previous results and solve a long-standing open problem. Our algorithm
is deterministic and uses simple data structures.
