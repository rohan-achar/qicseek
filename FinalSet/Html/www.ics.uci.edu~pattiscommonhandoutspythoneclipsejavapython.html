You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Python.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Python on Windows 7 in Fall 2013.

<h2>Python: Version 3.3.2</h2>
<p>

The Python download requires about 20 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,
  in case you need to re-install Python.
When installed, Python requires about an additional 50 MB of disk space.

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Click
    <a href="http://www.python.org/getit/" target = "_blank">
      Python Download</a>.
    <p>
    The following page will appear in your browser.

    <p>
    Read after <b>Download Python</b> to find the implementation that you want
      to install: in this handout we will download
      <b>Python 3.3.2 Windows x86 MSI Installer</b>.
    Even if you have a 64-bit operating system, I'd still suggest installing
      this version (to be compatible with Eclipse).
    <p>

<li>Click the bulleted item <b>Python 3.3.2 Windows x86 MSI Installer</b>
     (Windows binary -- does not include source).
    <p>
    The file named <b>python-3.3.2.msi</b> should start downloading into your
      standard download folder.
    This file is about 20 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 30 seconds over a
      cable modem).
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/msifile.jpg">

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>
<p>

<h3>Installing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the icon labeling the file <b>python-3.3.2.msi</b>.
    <p>
    An <b>Open File - Security Warning</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/openfilesecuritywarning.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Run</b>.
    <p>

    A <b>Python 3.3.2 Setup</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetup.jpg">
    <p>
    Ensure that the <b>Install for all users</b> radio button is pressed.

<p>
<li>Click <b>Next &gt;</b> button.
    <p>

    A new <b>Python 3.3.2 Setup</b> pop-up window will appear
    (<b>Select Destination Directory</b>).
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetup2.jpg">
    <p>
    The default directory will appear in the bottom as <b>C:\Python33\</b> and
      unless you have a good reason to use another directory, use this one.


<p>
<li>Click the <b>Next &gt;</b> button.
    <p>

    A new <b>Python 3.3.2 Setup</b> pop-up window will appear
    (<b>Customize Python 3.3.2</b>).
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetup3.jpg">
    <p>
    Use the default customization, which selects the Python Interpreter
      and all its libraries (about 29 Mb).
     

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Next &gt;</b> button.
    <p>

    In a few seconds a pop-up window titled <b>User Account Control</b> will
      appear, posing the question <b>Do you want the following program to
      install software on this computer?</b>
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/useraccountcontrol.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Yes</b> button.
    <p>
    A new <b>Python 3.3.2 Setup</b> pop-up window will appear
    (<b>Install Python 3.3.2</b>).
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/installpython.jpg">
    <p>
    During installation, it will show the various operations it is
      performing and a progress bar for each one.
    <p>
    Eventually a new <b>Python 3.3.2 Setup</b> pop-up window will appear
    (<b>Complete the Python 3.3.2 Installer</b>).
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetup5.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Finish</b> button.
</ol>
<p>
Python should now be installed.
To try to verify installation, navigate to the directory
   <b>C:\Python33</b> (or to whatever directory on which you installed Python)
   double-click the icon/file <b>python3.2.exe</b>.
The following pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonrunning.jpg">
    <p>
A pop-up window with the title <b>C:\Python33\python.exe</b> appears, and inside
  the window on the first line is the text <b>Python 3.3.2 ...</b>.
Inside the window, at the bottom left, is the prompt <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>: type
  <b>exit()</b> to this prompt and press <b>enter</b> to terminate Python.
<p>
You should keep the file <b>python-3.3.2.msi</b> somewhere on your computer in
   case you need to reinstall Python (not likely necessary).
<p>
You may now follow the instructions to download and install Java (if you have
  not already done so), and then the instruction to download and install the
  Eclipse IDE (for Python, Java, or both ).
Note: you you need to download/install Java even if you are using Eclipse only
  for Python)
