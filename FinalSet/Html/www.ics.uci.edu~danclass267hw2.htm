<LI> Consider the following two codings with source alphabet
     {a,b,c,d,e,f} and code alphabet {0,1}.
     For each code,
   <UL>
   <LI> Is it uniquely decodable?
        If not, prove it by giving two source messages that encode
        to the same code message.
   <LI> If it is uniquely decodable, is it a prefix code?
        If not a prefix code, give an equivalent prefix code with the same
        lengths of code words changing as few codings as possible.

  <LI> In a comma code, one code-symbol is used to end every codeword
     and is used in no other way.  Suppose for <I>a</I>-ary encoding of
     an <I>m</I>-letter alphabet, that the <I>m</I> words consist of the
     <I>m</I> shortest distinct strings of non-comma code letters
     followed by a comma.  Such a code is plainly prefix-free.
     Verify that it satisfies the Kraft inequality.

<LI> A full binary tree is <I>right justified</I> if, at each level of
the tree, all the nonterminal vertices appear to the right of all the
leaf vertices.  Show that there must be a lossless encoding method which
employs fewer than 0.85<I>N</I> codebits to encode each right justified
tree having <I>N</I> leaves, if <I>N</I> is sufficiently large.

<LI> Compact codes come from conservative expansions of a trivial code.
  <UL type=a>
  <LI> Prove that, for each compact code <I>C</I>, there exists exactly
      one expansion sequence from a trivial code to <I>C</I>, in which
      each expansion <I>S</I> &rArr; <I>S'</I>
      is an expansion of either the longest codelength, <I>L</I>,
      or the codelength <I>L</I>-1 in <I>S</I>.
