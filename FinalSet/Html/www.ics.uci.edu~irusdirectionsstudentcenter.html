<H1>Parking Information and Directions to the <br>
UC Irvine Student Center</H1>

If this is your first visit to the UCI campus, you should be aware that
it is not easy to figure out the campus. We recommend that you get a
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html">
map</a> with building numbers.
 
<p>
Parking permits are required at UCI.
<p>
 
If your company is an
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsors.html">
IRUS sponsor</a>,
then <b> <font color=red>prior to the meeting </font color></b>
you should obtain a preferred IRUS
parking permit from your
<A HREF="directions_uci.html#Corp_Reps"/">
corporate representative</A>.
 
<p>
Otherwise, you can purchase a permit at the Student Center parking
structure.
<p>
 
Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space, and to allow time to purchase a permit (non-sponsors) and
to walk to the meeting room in the Student Center.

<b>Parking</b>

<p>

If your company is an 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsors.html">
IRUS sponsor</a>, then as mentioned above, you should
obtain a preferred IRUS parking permit from your 
<A HREF="directions_uci.html#Corp_Reps"/">
corporate representative</a> prior to the meeting.

<p>

IRUS permits enable you to park in 
spaces with red AR signs in addition to unmarked spaces. Even when the 
parking structure gets filled, there are still usually red AR spaces.  
Please park in those spaces to leave the unmarked spaces free for people
who purchase permits. In the parking structure, AR spaces are on the
<b>first</b> and <b>lower</b> levels.

<p>

If your company is not a sponsor of IRUS, you may purchase a permit at the
parking structure. Use this permit to park in the unmarked spaces. If
the parking structure is full, the attendant will direct you to
alternate parking lots. You can purchase a permit from the attendant for
use in the other lots.
