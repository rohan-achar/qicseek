<h1>
Anonymous Card Shuffling and its Applications to Parallel Mixnets
</h1>
<h2>
Mike Goodrich
</h2>

<p>We study the question of how to shuffle <i>n</i> cards when faced
  with an opponent who knows the initial position of all the
  cards <i>and</i> can track every card when permuted, <i>except</i>
  when one takes <i>K</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>n</i> cards at a time and
  shuffles them in a private buffer &ldquo;behind your back,&rdquo;
  which we call <i>buffer shuffling</i>. The problem arises naturally in
  the context of parallel mixnet servers as well as other security
  applications. Our analysis is based on related analyses of
  load-balancing processes. We include extensions to variations that
  involve corrupted servers and adversarially injected messages, which
  correspond to an opponent who can peek at some shuffles in the buffer
  and who can mark some number of the cards. In addition, our analysis
  makes novel use of a sum-of-squares metric for anonymity, which leads
  to improved performance bounds for parallel mixnets and can also be
  used to bound well-known existing anonymity measures.</p>
