<p>

Widespread adoption of massively parallel deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing instruments has prompted the recent

development of de novo short read assembly algorithms. A common shortcoming of the available tools is their inability to

efficiently assemble vast amounts of data generated from large-scale sequencing projects, such as the sequencing of individual

human genomes to catalog natural genetic variation. To address this limitation, we developed ABySS (Assembly By

Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled

3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately

2.76 million contigs $100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68% of the

reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human

reference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.
