Dear moishe, 

I hope this note finds you and the best of health and in great spirits. 

I received your e-mail a while back,  sorry I did not respond earlier. 

The "Langsam Family" they you ask me about, in which I am a member of, 
it is absolutely 100 percent positively not related to you, or to anyone 
in your family tree. 

the reason is as follows,  our family name was changed, when my grandparents 
left the former Soviet Union, my grandparents more very righteous, and 
courageous people, they put their lives in danger to help others, one of the
ways Jewish people were able  to escape from Russia in that time, was by 
having fake documents, and that's what my grandmother did, when the Russian 
government was informed about this, and was looking to put her in jail, they 
received a passport from a family in Poland whose name was  Langsam, and they 
kept that named for good. 

if there's anything else I can help you with,  feel free to e-mail me,  All 
the best and good luck on your family tree. 

Chaim...

 my family lives in Brooklyn New York, but I have brothers that are in Ukraine, 
 Toronto Canada, Peoria Illinois, and much more. 

just wondering,  what's the difference if we come from Canada.
