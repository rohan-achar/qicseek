<h1>Outline for ICS-21 Written Midterm Exam</h1>
<p>
</center>
<hr align="left" width="100%">
<p>

I have collected together in this one handout the list of topics that we
  have covered in the first half of ICS-21.
This list is quite extensive (it is quite astounding how much material we
  have covered), and there is no way that I can ask questions covering all
  of it; likewise, there is  no way that you can learn all this material
  starting now (I'm assuming that you've been learning it during the entire
  quarter).
<p>
Therefore, you should concentrate on reviewing the most important analysis
  and synthesis skills that we have studied.
Use the quizzes (and to a lesser extent the programming assignments and daily
  homework assignments) as a guide for what material is of primary importance.
Understand the material on its own terms, and how to use this material when
  writing code.
<p>
My written exams are not designed to determine if you understand obscure
  material; instead, they are designed to determine if you understand
  important material, and can use your knowledge to understand and answer
  questions <b>quickly</b>.
My exams are long (some students will not finish them): it you don't
  immediately know the answer to a question, skip it, and come back to it
  later, if you have time (sometimes working problems later in the exam will
  remind you of something relevant to the answer to earlier questions).
