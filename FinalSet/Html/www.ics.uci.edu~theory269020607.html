Title: Online Strategies for Power Savings
<br>
Speaker: Sandra Irani</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
This talk is a survey of recent work in power saving strategies.
We address two different mechanisms for saving power. The first
is the ability to transition a device or system into a sleep state
if it is idle. The trade-off is that a fixed amount of energy is
needed to transition the device back into an active state in which
it can begin to process jobs. We extend previous work on this problem
and develop online algorithms for devices with multiple levels of
sleep states. Each sleep state has a different power consumption level
and different cost in transitioning back to the active state.

The second way in which power savings can be achieved is by varying
the speed at which jobs are run. We utilize a power consumption curve 
which indicates the power consumption level given a particular speed. 
The problem is to schedule arriving jobs in a way that minimizes total
energy use so that each job is completed by its deadline. Our work 
addresses systems whose speed can be varied and which have a sleep state. 
We devise both offline and online algorithms for this problem.
