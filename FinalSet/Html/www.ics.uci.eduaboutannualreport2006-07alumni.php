<br />
<p><strong>OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVOLVEMENT</strong> <br />

  paired with alumni and industry mentors who understand the process of   
  developing an idea into a viable product. To find out about the competition, visit

  students through the ICS Mentor Program. Students are able to select mentors <br />
  from a diverse pool of alumni. Mentors and students are matched for the duration <br />
  of the academic year, with the hope that both alumni and students will be able to <br />
  form long-lasting relationships.  </p>
