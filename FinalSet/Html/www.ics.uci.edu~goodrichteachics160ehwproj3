<p>
In this project you are to build a Java 
program that schedules simulated CPU jobs.
Your program should run in a loop, 
each iteration of which corresponds to a <b>time slice</b> for the CPU.
Each job is assigned a priority, which is an integer between -20
(highest priority) and 19 (lowest priority), inclusive.
From among all jobs waiting to be processed in a time slice, the CPU must
work on a job with highest priority.
In this simulation, each job will also come with a <i>length</i>
value, which is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, 
indicating the number of time slices that are needed to process this
job. For simplicity, you may assume 
jobs cannot be interrupted--once it is scheduled on the CPU,
a job runs for a number of time slices equal to its length.
Your simulator must output the name of the job running on the CPU in
each time slice and must process a sequence of commands,
one per time slice, each of
which is of one the following forms:
<ul>
<li> add <i>name</i> <i>n</i> <i>p</i>
<br>
which adds the new job, <i>name</i>, with length <i>n</i> and
priority <i>p</i>. For example, the following command adds a job
DogFace of length 15 and priority 5:
<pre>
add DogFace 15 5
</pre>
<li>
continue
<br>
which indicates that there is no new job for this time slice.
<li>
kill <i>name</i>
<br>
which kills the job, <i>name</i>, that is, it removes it from the collection
of waiting jobs.  If the job, <i>name</i>, is the one currently
running, it stops it and starts performing the next highest-priority
job waiting to be performed.
</ul>
<p>
Note: you may use the following class in your program:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">
java.util.Scanner</a>
<li>
<a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html">
java.util.PriorityQueue</a>
</ul>
You should read commands from System.in and output the name of the
job running in each time slice to System.out.
