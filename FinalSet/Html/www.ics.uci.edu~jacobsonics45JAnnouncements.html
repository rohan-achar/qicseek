After class tonight -
<p>
* A student said s/he had trouble sending a message
to ics45j@ics.uci.edu, the class email alias. I've checked
it out, including sending messages to it, and it appears
to be working ok now. If it acts up again, please
let me know.
<p>
* A student reported that Lab 1 was giving compile
time errors that seemed to indicate that a file was
missing from the project. I checked it out, and
somehow a couple of old versions of files
crept into the Lab 1 project file I posted, leading
to the errors. I've replaced the files with the correct
versions. I think things are ok now--but if not, again please
do let me know.
