<OL>
<P><LI>List three things you think computers can now do better than you, and three 
things you think you can do better than computers.</P>

<P><LI>Is there a (whole number) value of x that would cause an 
infinite loop in the procedure described below? Explain why or why not.
(Hint: Try it with a few small numbers to see what happens.)</P>

<PRE>
    Read a number x.
    Initialize a counter to zero.

    While x is greater than zero, perform the following steps:

        Increase the counter by one.
        If x is odd, replace x by (x+1)/2;
        otherwise (if x is even) replace x by x-2.

    Once the loop terminates (if it does),
    output the value of the counter and halt.
</PRE>

<P><LI>In the imaginary country of Binaria, the currency is based on the 
centina, which is worth approximately the same as a penny.  The coins of 
Binaria have values that are powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 
centinas.</P>

<P>(a) What coins should you use to make change for the following amounts of 
money?  (In each case answer with the smallest possible set of coins that 
adds up to the correct value.)</P>

<OL>
<LI>15 centinas
<LI>29 centinas
<LI>39 centinas
<LI>108 centinas
</OL>

<P>(b) Why might it be useful for Binarian cash registers to display 
amounts of money using binary notation?
