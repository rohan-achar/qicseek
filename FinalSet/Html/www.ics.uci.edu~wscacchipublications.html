Understanding the Social, Technological, and Policy Implications of Open
 Source Software Development</a>. Interest in open source software
development has emerged in many different research communities. Much of
this interest   has focused attention primarily onto the products of
open software development   (source code), and secondarily onto the
processes and productive units that   facilitatre such development. This
position paper identifies what I believe   are areas, topics, or basic
questions requiring further research in the arena  of open source
software development. Position paper presented at the <a href="http://cip.umd.edu/osagenda.htm"> NSF Workshop on Advancing the

Understanding the Requirements for Developing Open Source Software
Systems</a>. This study presents an initial set of findings from an
empirical study  of social processes, technical system configurations,
organizational contexts,    and interrelationships that give rise to
open software. The focus is directed    at understanding the
requirements for open software development efforts,   and how the
development of these requirements differs from those traditional   to
software engineering and requirements engineering. Four open software 
development communities are described, examined, and compared to help
discover what these differences may be. Eight kinds of software
informalisms are found to play a critical role in the elicitation,
analysis, specification, validation,  and management of requirements
for developing open software systems. Subsequently,    understanding
the roles these software informalisms take in a new formulation    of
the requirements development process for open source software is the 
focus of this study. (<i>IEE Proceedings--Software</i>, 149(1), 24-39,

Development Practices in Open Software Development Communities</a>. This
study presents an initial set of findings from an empirical study of
social  processes, technical system configurations, organizational
contexts, and interrelationships that give rise to open software. "Open
software", or more narrowly, open source software, represents an
approach for communities of like-minded participants to develop software
system representations that  are intended to be shared freely, rather
than offered as closed commercial  products. While there is a growing
popular literature attesting to open software,   there are very few
systematic empirical studies that informs how these communities
produce software. Similarly, little is known about how people in these
communities coordinate software development across different settings,
or about what  software processes, work practices, and organizational
contexts are necessary  to their success. To the extent that academic
research communities and commercial  enterprises seek the supposed
efficacy of open software, they will need grounded  models of the
processes and practices of open software development to allow
effective investment of their resources. This study investigates four
communities engaged in open software development. Case study methods are
used to compare  practices across communities. (Position paper

Modeling and Simulating Software Acquisition Process Architectures</a>. (with S. James Choi),
In this paper, we describe our efforts to support the modeling and
simulation of processes associated with software system acquisition
activities. Software    acquisition is generally a multi-organization
endeavor concerned with the    funding, management, engineering, system
integration, deployment and long-term    support of large software
systems. We first describe a language for modeling    software
acquisition processes at the architectural level. We then describe
our approach supporting the simulation of software acquisition processes
within a process architecture. Along the way, we introduce how we
employ  the High-Level Architecture (HLA) and Run-Time Infrastructure
(RTI) to support   the distribution, concurrent execution and
interoperation of multiple software   process simulations to address
the complexity of software acquisition process architectures. In
addition, we also introduce the design and prototyping  of a Web-based
environment which supports the modeling and simulation of acquisition
process architectures. (appears in <i>Journal of Systems and Software</i>

Specifying Process-Oriented Hypertext for Organizational Computing</a>. (with John Noll),
Organizations deploy intranets to provide access to documents for those 
who use them. But the web of computing comprises more than just
documents: people, tools, and processes are critical to organizational
function. In particular, people may need guidance on how to perform
tasks, as well as access to information necessary to carry out those
tasks. In this paper, we present a language for describing
process-oriented hypertexts. A process-oriented hypertext links
information, tools, and activities into a seamless organizational web.
Using such a hypertext, and process performer can enact a process by
browsing, and receive guidance on how to perform the process
activities, where to and relevant information, and what tools to use.
The PML process modeling language provides a way for process engineers
to specify process models in terms of activities, and the sequence in
which they should be performed. The specifcation can be elaborated with
descriptions of resources and tools required and provided by activities,
and the skills necessary to carry out an activity. The resulting models
are then translated into one or more process-oriented hypertexts that
represent instances of the process currently being performed. PML
includes features that allow the modeler to specify how the process
activities should be dynamically linked to information and resource
nodes at the time the process is performed.  This enables processes to
be described as abstract models that can be instantiated as
process-oriented hypertexts in different organizational settings. We
used PML to model processes in a case study of the grants management
process at the US Office of Naval Research. We describe some of our
experiences applying PML to this study, and conclude with lessons
learned and directions for future study. (appears in<i> Journal of

Redesigning Contracted Service Procurement for Internet-based Electronic
 Commerce: A Case Study</a>. This paper describes a case study focused
on redesigning procurement processes for research grants at the Office
of Naval  Research. These processes focus on the procurement of research

Web-based capabilities.   By examining these processes, we gain insight
into issues and challenges  to be addressed in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
redesigning service procurement with Internet-based  Electronic
Commerce capabilities. In collaboration with other participants  in
this effort, we found that we could contribute to a substantial 
reduction  in process cycle time and operational costs associated with

An Environment for Research in Software Systems Acquisition</a>. (with A. Valente, J. Noll, and J.S. Choi),&nbsp; In this
 paper, we present initial results from basic research and exploratory
studies in the area of software systems acquisition. This research
sought to design    a web-based, computer-supported work environment
that facilitates research    and development in the area of software
systems acquisition. This environment    supports the capture,
representation, and operationalization of various  forms of knowledge
associated with a new vision for virtual system acquisition,    called
VISTA. The schemes for organizing and managing knowledge rooted in
software feasibility heuristics and informal/formal models of software
acquisition and systems engineering processes are called knowledge webs.
Accordingly, the environment that provides the mechanisms for capturing,
 representing,  interlinking and operationalizing access to these
knowledge webs is called  a knowledge web management system (KWMS).
Thus, the environment  that is the  focus of this research effort is
designed to provide a KWMS capability  that  provides access to an
incrementally evolving knowledge web for software  acquisition research
and practice in line with the VISTA vision. This environment for 
software acquisition web management is called SAWMAN (submitted for

Experience with Software Architectures and Configured Software

experience in the specification,    design, implementation and
evolution of software engineering environments    and process-driven
software environments. Along the way, we have developed    or used a
variety of alternative architectural notations to support these
efforts. We also have employed architectural design concepts and
notations to specify, "code" and evolve a variety of configured software
descriptions,    including software life cycle documents, software
hypertexts, software processes,   and others. In this regard, we have
found it useful to explore alternative   schemes for combining software

overview of research results from  business process redesign to help
draw attention to the importance of treating  process redesign as a

Supporting Software Development in Virtual Enterprises</a>. (with John Noll), This paper
presents recent   developments in a distributed semantic hypertext
framework called DHT that   supports software development projects
within virtual enterprises. We show   how hypertext functionality
embodied in DHT solves the practical problems   of project coordination
including, collaborative sharing data in a virtual   enterprise of
distributed teams, integrating existing tools and environments,   and
enacting software processes to coordinate development activities for
teams across wide-area networks. In particular, we describe how software
process enactment can be achieved within a virtual enterprise without
centralized    mechanisms. This is when the process description is

system acquisition more agile  and adaptive,  through the evolutionary
modeling, simulation, and development  of the system  being acquired. We

Experience with Software Process Simulation and Modeling</a> . This paper
 describes an approach taken and experiences encountered in developing

Processes   for both software development and use have been
investigated. As such, the    focus of this paper is aimed at addressing
three aspects of software process    simulation and modeling. First, I
describe an approach and examples of software simulation and modeling
as investigated with the Articulator environment developed at USC.
Second, I describe how by focusing on process modeling,   analysis, and
simulation, we are led to expand the scope of work with software  
processes toward a more comprehensive software process life cycle
engineering.   Third, I describe some of the lessons learned from
applying modeling and  simulation concepts, techniques, and tools to
software processes in a variety  of organizational settings.
Conclusions then stress the complementary value arising from the use of
both qualitative and quantitative technologies for  software process
simulation and modeling. (<i> Journal of Systems and Software</i> ,

Computational Business Process Components for Electronic Commerce</a>.
In this position paper, I focus on addressing computational business
processes as software components for&nbsp; Electronic Commerce. These
components can   be configured into an organizational process
architecture that serves as  a reusable framework for developing an EC
information infrastructure. Process-driven   Intranets then serve as a
distributed development and run-time support environment   for the
framework. Since PDIs can span organizational boundaries, and since
PDIs in different organizations may be interconnected, then
process-driven extranets can be created and deployed. PDIs and PDEs
enable the design, integration, and enactment of virtual enterprises.
When a community of virtual enterprises emerges and begins to support
business transactions among these enterprises, then virtual markets can
appear, as can different kinds of computational   economies. With the
exception of this last item, I have experience in developing   and
applying these capabilities in different organizational settings. My
experience leads me to believe that CBPs are viable components for EC.
Furthermore, such components address an orthogonal set of issues
compared to those addressed   by other potential EC technologies such as
CORBA/DCOM, EDI X12 transaction   standards, Java/ActiveX, UML, and
others. Subsequently, the potential value   of CBPs can be assessed
independent of choices made in using or evolving  other EC technologies.
Thus, CBPs merit consideration as a foundational software   technology
for EC. (Presented at the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/%7Ecitm/CEC/program1.html"><i> 1998</i> <i>

Comparative Case Analysis for Understanding Software Processes</a>. This
paper provides   an exploration of the analysis and use of comparative
case studies as an  approach to understanding software processes in
complex organizational settings.  Case studies are well suited to
capture and describe how software  processes  occur in real-world
settings, what kinds of problems emerge, how they are  addressed, and
how software engineering tools, techniques, or concepts are  employed.
The overall purpose of comparative case analysis is to discover   and
highlight second- or higher-order phenomena or patterns that transcend
the analysis of an individual case. Comparative case analysis provides a
strategy that enables the development of more generalizable results and
testable  theories  than individual or disjoint case studies alone can
provide. This  study incorporates  an examination and review of four
empirical studies of  processes involved  in developing, using, or
evolving software systems that  employ comparative  case analyses.
Finally, a meta analysis of these four  studies then highlights  the
strengths and weaknesses of comparative case  analyses when used to
empirically examine and understand software processes.  (Draft for

A Meta-Model for Formulating Knowledge-Based Models of Software
Development</a>.(with P. Mi),  In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-based
meta-model which serves  as   a <i>unified resource model</i> for
integrating characteristics of major   types of objects appearing in
software development models (SDMs). The URM   consists of a taxonomy of <i>resource
classes</i> and a <i>web of relations</i> that link different types of
resources found in different kinds of models   of software development.
The URM includes specialized models for software  systems, documents,
agents, tools, and development processes. The URM has   served as the
basis for integrating and interoperating a number of process-centered  
CASE environments. The major benefit of the URM is twofold: First, it
forms   a higher level of abstraction supporting SDM formulation that
subsumes many   typical models of software development objects. Hence,
it enables a higher   level of reusability for existing support
mechanisms of these models. Second,   it provides a basis to support
complex reasoning mechanisms that address  issues across different
types of software objects. To explore these features, we describe the
URM both formally and with a detailed example, followed by a
characterization of the process of SDM composition, and then by a
characterization of the life cycle of activities involved in an overall

The SMART Approach to Software Process Engineering</a>. (with P. Garg, P. Mi, and G. Thunquest), In this paper,
we describe  a methodology for software process engineering and an
environment, SMART, that supports it. SMART supports a process
life-cycle that includes   the modeling, analysis, and execution of
software processes. SMART's process   monitoring capabilities can be
used to provide feedback from process execution   to the process model.
SMART represents the integration of three separately   developed process
mechanisms, and it uses two modeling formalisms (object-oriented   
data representation and imperative-style programming language) to
bridge   the gap between process modeling, analysis, and execution.
SMART demonstrates    the meta-environment concept, using a process
modeling formalism as input    specification to a generator that
produces Process-Centered Software Engineering Environments (PSEEs).
Furthermore, SMART supports a team-oriented approach    for process
modeling, analysis, and execution. (appears in, <span style="font-style: italic;">Proc. 16th. Intern. Conf. Software Engineering</span>, IEEE Computer

Understanding the Requirements for Information System Documentation: An
Empirical Investigation</a>.(with A. Jazzar), Software and Information Systems (IS)
documents are a common product of large IS development efforts. These
documents are   produced and consumed through a variety of documentation
processes. These&nbsp;   processes involve developers and users working
within complex organizational   settings, as well as with the focal
system under development. These organizational   settings facilitate
and constrain IS documentation and development efforts   in complicated
ways. Accordingly, we present, analyze, and compare cases from field
studies of three different IS development efforts in a large industrial
corporation. Based on these studies, we identify a new set of variables

requirements   for IS documentation products and processes in different

for Software Production</a>. (with A. Karrer),&nbsp; Researchers who create software production
 environments face considerable problems. Software production
environments are large systems that are costly to develop. Furthermore,
software production  environments which support particular software
engineering methods may not  be applicable to a large number of
software production projects. These conditions  have formed a trend
towards research into ways which will lessen the cost  of developing
software production environments. In particular, the trend has been
towards the construction of meta-environments from which specific
software production environments can be created. In this paper, we
attempt to categorize more than 60 meta-environment efforts. For each of
the categories, we review research efforts which illustrate different
approaches within that category. We conclude by presenting an emerging
common thread of requirements which links this field together. (appears

Process Integration in CASE Environments</a>.(with P. Mi), Integrated CASE

In this paper,   we present a new type of integration called process

argue that the major benefits of   process integration to software

integration which form the backbone of a process-centered  CASEE. These
components include software process models, a process enactment

Furthermore,   our strategy implements process integration by merging

Articulation: An Integrated Approach to the Diagnosis, Replanning, and

plan when a diagnosed failure  occurs and reschedules changes that
ensure the plan's continuation. In implementing  articulation, we
combine knowledge-based diagnosis, replanning, and rescheduling  into a
powerful mechanism supporting process-based software development. Use of

A Knowledge-Based Software Process Library for Process-Driven Software

technique for software  production, in which a conceptual knowledge
representation. called a software  process, is used to represent and
guide development activities.  Management  and reuse of software
processes therefore becomes a requirement  for process-driven  software
development. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based  process
library (SPLib) that supports the organization, access and reuse  of
software processes. SPLib consists of a knowledge base of software
process representations.  It also provides a set of process operations
that support  browsing, searching  composition and abstraction. These
operations reason  about the content of  software processes as well as
maintain proper interdependency  relationships  among the software
processes. To demonstrate the use of SPLib  in process-driven  software
development, we provide a usage scenario where  SPLib facilitates  the

Modeling Articulation Work in Software Engineering Processes</a>.(with P. Mi),
Current software process modeling techniques do not generally support
articulation work. Articulation work includes the diagnosis, recovery,

integral part of software    process enactment since software processes
can sometimes fail or breakdown.    This paper presents a
knowledge-based model of articulation work in software    engineering
processes. It uses empirically grounded heuristics to address    three
problems in articulation work: diagnosing failed development activities,
determining appropriate recovery, and resuming software process
enactment,    We first investigate the role and importance of
articulation work with respect   to planned software development
activities. We then outline a knowledge-based    model of articulation
work. The model has been implemented in a knowledge-based    software

an approach to resolving some of the conceptual and technical problems

approach provides a formal basis for existing notions of system

provide the underpinnings for a rigorous notion of system integrity,
and mechanisms to control the evolution of configurations. This
