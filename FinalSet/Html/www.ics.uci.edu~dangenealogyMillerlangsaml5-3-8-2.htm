Dear Moishe

How clever to try all those email addresses and succeed in getting through
to me.

I have had a look at your website and I was extremely impressed.  My only
information on Langsam comes from the family tree  put together by Susan
Wynne et al.  But, while it is very broad reaching, I found yours easier to
follow  obviously because of its narrowness but also because there is more
detail. For the first time I was able easily to go straight back to Pesach
through Chaim Lieb.

 My grandmother was Cila Raff,  her mother was Ethel Fish,  Ethels father
was Mendel  Fish who was  Miriam Langsam's son,

My grandmother had a number of siblings. Some of whom are in the Fish and
the Langsam.Spira  family tree. However her father married twice and there
were other siblings from the second marriage whose names we do not know.
Cila had a brother who ended up in the USA . His name mayhave been Martin
Raff.

This is all very exciting and I shall keep watching your pages for more
developments.

Incidentally, despite my Irish name, I am a sabra born in Haifa in 1943 but
lived most of my life in Australia.

I am writing a novel at the moment and part of it is  set in the forests of
easter Poland  during World War II. As you probably know there were a
number of Jewish partisan camps and if you know of anybody who would help
me with experiences of this time and place - I would  be extremely
grateful.

Kind regards
Eileen Naseby

Thanks for this Moishe

My info at this stage  has been the Langsam family tree. I went to Poland 
in October ( a long way from Sydney) and visited Dynov where my grandmother 
was born. The Jewish cemetries were, of course, empty of headstones. Yet it 
was a very moving experience. I intend to go back to do some further 
research so maybe  I will come up with further information when I  have 
more time. I  am writing a novel which is totally fiction but the 
characters are loosely based on my mother and grandmother. So because the 
novel  research was my main purpose in going to Poland ( and then to 
Jerusalem) I had little time for things of a genealogical nature.

According to yours and Susanne's family tree the following is my lineage

Pesach Langsam
Chaim Leib
Miriam Langsam
Mendel Fish
Ethel Fish - Hirsch Raff
Cila  Raff - Solomon Singer
Ursula Singer - Anthony Piercy
Eileen Piercy - David  Naseby
Nigel and Toby Naseby

My mother, Ursula's, second marriage to Nigel Hall produced five children
Diana, Charmian, Stephen, Naomi, Michael


I can see this all could become very addictive
Cheers and Happy New Year
Eileen Naseby

Hi,
All of us are researching the Langsam family. I have a website at
www.langsam.com
which some of you have seen.
I would appreciate any feedback, insight, additional info that you can
supply to supplement the site as well as connect us more firmly together.
Thanks!

You are on the right track.  My grandfather's 1st cousin was Abraham RAFF
(watchmaker) and his father was Hirsh Raff.  He last lived in Prsymersyl
(excuse spelling - too lazy to look it up). Eileen told me that good old
Hersh RAFF was married twice, but knows nothing of the first marriage.


I made contact with my dad's first cousin a couple of year's ago.  In our
phone conversation, he mentioned that my grandfather had told him that the
RAFFs were once known as FISH/FISCH.  The story made no sense, and I decided
the whole thing was pretty 'fishy'.  I than chanced on this Ethel FISH RAFF,
and the story seemed to have more credence.  I now think that maybe this
Abraham RAFF, not my grandfather, told the cousin that story.  I guess it
turned out to be true, but I don't think for my branch of the family.  My
RAFFs were associated with the SICHERMAN name.


According to Eilenn Naseby of Australia at eileen@filmworld.com.au , many of
her relatives were watchmakers, also.  She has a Bukowsko connection, so I
figured there must be a relationship of some type.  I didn't see her family
tree, until I met her in L.A.  Her RAFF branch seems to have made a pitstop
in Israel before immigrating to Australia.  She was born in Palestine.


So, it looks like you have a new email address to add.  Eileen is a real
interesting person.  She was to have completed her first novel in January,
which is loosely based on her grandmother.  She was not brought up in a
religious home and her sister and her mom seem to have become members of the
Bahai faith.  I don't know if she has ever been in a synagogue.  She owns a
film company, which rents historical video footage to film productions, etc.

I happened upon your site tonight, and found our ongoing "conversation".  I found 
it pretty strange, actually, to be reading all of this.  One of those "Twilight 
Zone" moments.  I still wish I could figure out my connection to the grand scheme 
of the Langsam world.  I did note that I mentioned that my grandfather's cousin, 
Abraham RAFFs father was named Hersch, yet as I now recall, I think I settled on 
Henoch in the end.  So, my prior info. that he may be the "lost" brother to Eileen, 
the Aussie's grandmother, may or may not be the case.  Eileen was to ask some 
questions on this matter after our L.A. meeting, but I don't know if this ever 
happened.
 
Anyway, I just thought I would touch base.  BTW, will you be going to London?  If 
so, let me know, and I will be on the look-out for you.  I did go to the Boston 
convention years ago, and always had the intention of going to others, but my summer 
vacations seemed to get in the way.
