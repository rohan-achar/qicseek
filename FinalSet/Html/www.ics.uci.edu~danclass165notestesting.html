<H3> Testing </H3>

You may choose your own format for test input.&nbsp;
Be sure that you document such decisions:&nbsp;
your reasons for your choices over others,
and any significant/relevant side-effects of your choices.&nbsp;
Efficiency is the primary consideration,
but ease and clarity of coding should not be overlooked.&nbsp;
Document and justify all of your decisions.
<P>
The main concern is that your algorithms (sorts, multipliers, etc.)
should be independent of the source of data, timing routines,
debugging, testing routines, I/O, etc.&nbsp;
I should be able to take your code for the
function(s) that perform some job and use your code
without having your routines waste space copying the input
(unless the algorithm requires it), waste time performing timing
operations, or produce annoying debugging or testing printouts.&nbsp;
All of these tasks should be performed by your testing functions
before and after calling the lab function, for whatever algorithm
is being tested.&nbsp;
Obviously this means that the functions should not be passed anything
but what they need to do the job they are written for:&nbsp;
not structures to record testing information or
switches for testing-related control.&nbsp;
The set of functions that perform a task may share global data if you
find it absolutely necessary,
but should not share any global data with the other portions of your
lab (I/O, testing, etc.).
<P>
It is not sufficient to state that there are no error conditions just
because your testing functions always generate correct tests.&nbsp;
Your functions should do something reasonable if the data passed
to them cannot be processed properly.&nbsp;
You may even want to have your tester throw some errors at your
functions to demonstrate their reactions.&nbsp;
Possible errors include (but are not necessarily limited to)
having a negative dimension passed as a parameter,
getting an illegal result during arithmetic calculation
(such as overflow),
or being unable to allocate scratch memory needed.&nbsp;
If you read from a file, you should be able to gracefully handle errors
related to file access.
<P>
The output of your program should not contain lengthy
"dumps" of all variables evaluated by the various
functions in your program.&nbsp;
Instead, your test procedures should call your functions
and then use a simple (and possibly slower) method of verifying
the accuracy of your results.&nbsp;
Thus, the only output (other than statistics) should be
short indications from the test procedure that your
inner project procedures are working correctly.&nbsp;
I should have to check only the correctness of your test
procedures in order to be convinced of the correctness of your lab.

<H3> Verification </H3>

In the simplest sense, verification means demonstrating that your
program works.&nbsp;  Verification runs should show that
subroutines, subparts, and the final product work.&nbsp;
These runs must show that:

<UL>
<LI> your program meets the lab specifications
<LI> your program handles end conditions
<LI> your program sensibly recovers from user errors
<LI> any special features you claim to have, actually work
</UL>

<P>
Verification runs should include:
<UL>
<LI> a description of how the run was generated
     (compilation, execution commands)
<LI> an echo of all input
<LI> a description of what the test is supposed to indicate
</UL>
<P>
