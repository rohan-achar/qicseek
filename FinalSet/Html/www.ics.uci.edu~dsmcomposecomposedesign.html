    <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Ensuring 
    correctness in a purely reflective model involves reasoning about system 
    level interactions by characterizing the semantics of shared distributed 
    resources and understanding what correctness of the overall system means.&nbsp; 
    The <b>TLAM </b>(Two Level Actor Machine) model was presented as a first 
    step towards providing a formal semantics for specifying and reasoning about 
    properties of and interactions between components of ODSs. In the <b>TLAM</b>, 
    a system is composed of two kinds of actors, <b><i>base actors</i></b> and
    <b><i>meta actors</i></b>, distributed over a network of processing nodes. 
    Base level actors carry out application level computation, while meta-actors 
    are part of the runtime system, which manages system resources and controls 
    the runtime behavior of the base level.&nbsp; Meta-actors communicate with each 
    other via message passing as do base level actors, but they may also examine 
    and modify the state of the base actors located on the same node.&nbsp; </span>
    <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; layout-grid-mode: line">The TLAM 
    uses reification (base object state as data at the meta object level) and 
    reflection (modification of base object state by meta objects) with support 
    for implicit invocation of meta objects in response to changes of base level 
    state. It provides for full actor-style interaction of meta level objects.
    </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the TLAM model, meta-level 
    controllers define protocols and mechanisms that customize various aspects 
    of distributed systems management. In practice, multiple system and 
    application activities occur concurrently in a distributed system, e.g. 
    scheduling, protocol processing, stream synchronization etc., and can 
    therefore interfere with each other. </span></p>

    <font face="Times New Roman">To ensure non-interference and manage the 
        complexity of reasoning about components of ODSs in general, our 
        strategy is to identify key system services where non-trivial 
        interactions between the application and system occur, i.e. base-meta 
        interactions.&nbsp; We refer to these key services as <i>core services</i>.&nbsp; 
        Core services are used in specifying and implementing more complex 
        activities within the framework as purely meta-level interactions.&nbsp; 
        The development of suitable non-interference requirements allows us to 
        reason about the composition of multiple system services; these services 
        have constraints that must be obeyed to maintain composability (i.e. 
        safe concurrent execution). We use commonly observed patterns in 
        distributed systems to identify three meta level core activities (See

      remote creation are managed by remote creation meta-actors (RCM) residing 
      on every node in the system. A remote creation request has four parameters

      system during the migration process, we classify the migration process 
      into 3 phases with respect to the actor being migrated and the node to 
      which it is being migrated. The first phase is the initiation phase and 
      specifies the state of the system when the migration request received can 
      be processed. It determines the computation to be migrated by suspending 
      the computation of the actor and noting its current description. In the

      This work illustrates the use of TLAM services in the design of mechanisms

      environment. We extend the basic meta-architectural framework to provide 
      QoS based services to applications.&nbsp; The base level component of the meta 
      architecture implements the functionality of the distributed session and 
      deals with (a) data, which includes objects of varying media, types, e.g., 
      video and audio files and (b) requests to access this data via sessions. 
      The meta-level component deals with the coordination of multiple requests 
      and sharing of existing resources among multiple requests.&nbsp; To provide 
      coordination at the highest level and perform admission control for new 
      incoming sessions, a meta-level entity called the <i>QoS broker</i> is 
      being developed. The organization of the meta-level services in CompOSE|Q

    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The two main functions of 
    the QoS broker are (a) data management and (b) request management. The <i>

    distributed system, i.e. it decides when and where to create additional 
    replicas of data. It also determines when additional replicas of data actors 
    are no longer needed and can be garbage collected/dereplicated.&nbsp; We 
    implement adaptive admission control mechanisms in the 
    request-scheduling module that assigns requests to servers and ensures 
    cost-effective utilization of resources. The <i>message-scheduling</i> 
    module ensures QoS constraint satisfaction of requests that have already 
    been initiated. The data and request management functions in turn require 
    auxiliary services such as clock synchronization, replication, dereplication

    among the auxiliary services that are used to provide QoS, the specific 
    mechanisms implemented for placement and scheduling must be designed not to 
    conflict with each other. Currently, placement and dereplication operate on 
    the basis of a (conservative) snapshot of the current resource allocation 
    and use.&nbsp; The placement and dereplication services do not consider the exact 
    times at which requests arrive; in contrast, an adaptive request scheduling 
    process makes decisions based on the exact arrival times of requests. 
    However, without appropriate constraints on the usage of these services, 
    inconsistencies can arise due to their interaction.&nbsp; The broker coordinates 
    the service interaction by constraining the behavior of the auxiliary 
    placement and scheduling services.&nbsp; For instance, the dereplication service 
    does not dereplicate a replica that the request scheduling process is making 
    an assignment to. Furthermore a replica assigned to an active request should 
    not be physically dereplicated.&nbsp; The broker also ensures that the 
    dereplication and placement metalevel services do not cancel one another 
    out.&nbsp; While the interaction between dereplication and placement is not a 
    functional correctness issue, it has to do with cost-effective performance

    to provide correct composition of communication services to QoS-based 
    applications in a transparent and scalable fashion, while ensuring 
    correctness of basic middleware services in a meta level architecture for 
    distributed resource management (<i>e.g.</i> garbage collection, remote 
    creation), the TLAM model is extended with a composable reflective 
    communication framework (CRCF), which customizes the base level 
    communication services among a group of objects as follows . Each base level 
    actor has a meta level actor, called <i>messenger</i>, which serves as the 
    customized and transparent mail queue for that base level actor.&nbsp; There is 
    one <i>communication manager</i> in every node of the distributed system, 
    which implements and controls the correct composition of communication 
    services specified by the messenger. The messenger has four message queues: 
    the up and down queues are used to communicate with its base level actor, 
    serving as the actor�s send buffer and customized mail queue respectively, 
    while the in and out queues are used for interaction with the communication 
    manager, requesting communication services that satisfy QoS constraints. The 
    up and down queues hold raw messages from and to base level actors, while 
    the out and in queues hold processed messages, which are messages with the 
    required protocols enforced. Furthermore, the communication manager has a 
    set of communication protocol actors, each of them implementing a particular 
    communication service provided by the framework (<i>e.g.</i> reliable 
    protocol, in-order protocol). </font>
    <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Communication services can be added 
    (<i>plugged in</i>) or removed (<i>plugged out</i>) dynamically without side 
    effects. The above scheme allows us to abstract a core set of communication 
    services and share it between the different messengers on a node, 
    simplifying the synchronization and composition process, while encouraging 
    separation of concerns in the process of message transmission and reception. 
    In order to maintain accurate semantics and provide an efficient 
    implementation of the architecture, the communication manager implements a 
    set of meta level representatives, called <i>pool-actors</i>. At any 
    instance, the pool-actor handles the communication services requested by a 
    messenger for an individual message.&nbsp; In other words, every message 
    requiring communication services is assigned a pool actor.&nbsp; The pool actor 
    assures the correct order of composition of required services and provides a 
    coordination mechanism between the messenger that requires the services and 
    the protocols that provide it. This concept of reusable pool-actors is an 
    efficient way to handle the service request of each messenger without having 
    to pay the bottleneck associated with the centralization of the services in 
    the node communication manager.&nbsp; In summary, the notion of pool actors 
    provides separation of concerns and manageable concurrency in the 
    communication process.</span></p>

      Each node running CompOSE|Q has one NodeManager to manage actors on that 
      node, as well as to start-up and shutdown various other modules of the 
      run-time system.&nbsp; When a new actor is created it registers itself with the NodeManager and is identified by an Actor ID (aid).&nbsp; The NodeManager 
      enters the new actor into a local-table which helps keep track of the 
      actor for activities such as node checkpointing and node shutdown and 
      notifies the MessageQmanager entity, which allocates a message queue that 
      serves as the �in� Queue for the actor. The MessageQManager is responsible 
      for managing mail queues for all actors on a node. To start CompOSE|Q on a 
      node, the NodeManager has to be started first.&nbsp; It in turn, initiates the 
      various other modules and communication components.</span></li>

      </span></b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The NodeInfoManager is 
      a repository of information as well as an interface to the main directory 
      service in the distributed architecture. Currently, the NodeInfoManager 
      implements basic functionality to: 1) Register an actor with the directory 
      service so that it is accessible to all other nodes 2) Search for a 
      particular actor to find out which node that actor is currently on and 3) 
      Search for an actor object given the class name (a rudimentary naming 
      service). </span><font face="Times New Roman">The NodeInfoManager has a 
      local-table, which contains references to all local actors (updated and 
      maintained by the NodeManager) and a remote-actor cache that contains 
      information about recently accessed remote actors.</font></li>

      Communication Subsystem:<i> </i></span></b>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The communication transport layer 
      and the CRCF module(above the transport layer), together compose the node 
      communication subsystem. The message transport layer provides a framework 
      for sending the outgoing messages to the appropriate node (routing) and 
      resolving incoming messages to their appropriate actor queues 
      (message-resolution). The CRCF module is responsible for the 
      implementation of communication services (and their composition). 
      Separation of these layers allows for independent customization of 
      protocol implementations and the messaging runtime. This facilitates 
      correct composition of protocols without interfering with the runtime 
      communication semantics. </span><font face="Times New Roman">The 
      communication transport layer consists of the following components: a <i>
      Router</i>, a <i>Postman</i> and a <i>RemoteMessageReceiver</i>. <i>&nbsp;</i>The 
      transport layer maintains two message queues on a node for incoming and 
      outgoing messages (on that node) called <i>SendPot</i> and <i>ReceivePot</i> 
      respectively. The <i>Router</i> consults the<i> NodeInfoManager</i> to 
      obtain the current location (node) of the target actor. If the location of 
      the target actor is local (i.e. on the same node), the <i>Router</i> puts 
      the message directly into the node's <i>ReceivePot</i>. Otherwise, it 
      sends the message to the remote node. The <i>RemoteMessageReceiver</i> (RMR) 
      on the target node extracts the incoming message and puts it into the 
      node's ReceivePot.&nbsp; The <i>Postman</i> then picks up the message and adds 
      it to the target actor's �in� Queue. </font>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The communication manager is 
      instantiated in each node during system startup.<span style="color:black"> 
      When an actor is created and protocol composition services are not desired 
      or required </span></span><font face="Times New Roman">
      <span style="color: black">ts <i>messenger</i> is not created and</span> 
      the actor sends and receives raw messages using the transport layer<span style="color:black">. 
      When flexible communication is required or desired, an independent <i>
      messenger</i> is created for every base level actor and the entire CRCF 
      functionality is invoked. The overhead of the CRCF module is minimized in 
      case of communications with no protocols attached. In this scenario, we 
      tunnel raw messages through the actor's messenger directly to the 
      transport layer.</span></font></li>
