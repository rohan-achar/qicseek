<H1>Computer Law Seminar Readings
</H1>
<P>This list will grow as the quarter progresses.
Many of these materials were written for lawyers, which means
they presume some familiarity with legal terms and concepts.
Of course I encourage you to note unfamiliar terms and bring
them to class so I can (try to) clarify them.
</P>
<P>
I have made the non-Web references
listed below available in the grad course materials file
(the upper left drawer in the filing cabinet outside the ICS kitchen).
</P>
There won't be as many readings on other topics as there are on 
intellectual property;
there's more settled computer law in IP than in most other areas.
