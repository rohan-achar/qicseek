<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due on Monday, February
7, by 7:00 p.m. in the locking box in CS 189.  Turn in everything you have
completed at that time; we can&#39;t grade straggling assignments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B>  In this assignment you will
work with some realistic functional programs.  You&#39;ll also get experience
with BNF and with issues of scoping and binding.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Readings and review questions:</B>  This
assignment covers more of Sebesta, chapters 3 and 4.  You should know the
answers to the review questions listed below, but you do not have to turn
them in.  This list should help you identify some of the more important
concepts in the text.  (On the other hand, don&#39;t infer that the topics
we skip or omit are entirely <I>un</I>important.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Chapter 3:  1, 7, 8, 14</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Chapter 4:  1, 2, 4, 6-14, 16, 18-23.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part I:</B>  Syntax description</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  In the Sebesta text, do the following
problems in the problem set starting on page 152: pick one of the five parts
of problem 2; pick two of the four parts of problem 4; problem 6; problem
8; problem 10; and problem 11 (which, as written, is a trick question).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Write an EBNF grammar for HTML
documents.  You don&#39;t have to cover all of HTML; just handle about ten
of the most popular tags (including &lt;A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;) in their basic
forms.  Use <U>|&#160;boxed text |</U> instead of &lt;angle brackets&gt;
for your nonterminals, so you don&#39;t get confused with the angle brackets
that are part of HTML itself.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part II:</B>  Scoping and binding</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>In the Sebesta text, do the following problems
in the problem set starting on page 189 (this is labeled &quot;problem set,&quot;
not &quot;review questions.&quot;): 2, 4, 6, 9.  Draw two contour models
for problem 9 (one for static scoping, one for dynamic), as we did in class;
it will help a lot.  The other problems in the section aren&#39;t required,
but if you don&#39;t feel comfortable with the scoping issues you should
try to work them out.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Part III:</B>  Functional programming in
real programs</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Attached to this assignment is
a simple Scheme program to maintain a database of restaurant objects.  It&#39;s
available on the lab server.  Load the program into EdScheme (click the
lambda button) and play around with it for a while:  Evaluate </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">(restaurants)</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
in the transcript window and give commands to add, remove, print, and search
for restaurants.  (Represent restaurant names either as double-quoted strings
or as Lisp lists of symbols--just keep to one representation consistently.)
 You don&#39;t have to turn anything in to demonstrate your experimentation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a.1)</B>  Modify the program code so that
it gives the user an additional menu choice:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">&#160;&#160; c:  Clear all the restaurants from
the collection</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>When the user types &#39;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">c</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&#39;,
the program should remove all the restaurants from the collection (so that
if the next command were &#39;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><TT>p</TT></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&#39;,
for example, nothing would be printed).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This will require modifications or additions
in a few places; you can do the main part of the work very easily indeed,
with a single function call.  The key is to think functionally, not of changing
values but of describing or creating the new value.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a.2)</B>  The search command currently
allows the user to search only for restaurants by name.  We know that </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">collection-select</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
allows much more flexible searching, however.  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Modify the </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">search-collection</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
routine in the main program to give the user a choice of searching by name
or by cuisine.  If the user chooses to search by cuisine, prompt for the
type of cuisine and perform the requested search with appropriate calls
to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">collection-select</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.
  [Hint:  Consider using some of the code on the second page of the &quot;Notes
on Scheme&quot; handout.]</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a.3)  </B>Now, ask yourself how much code
it would have taken to accomplish the same thing in C++.  You don&#39;t
have to write an answer, but it&#39;s worth thinking about.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Also attached to this assignment
is an implementation of binary search trees in Scheme.  It, too, is available
on the server.  Load it and experiment with it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.1)</B>  What happens when you add a
duplicate item (an item whose value is already in the tree)?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.2)  </B>Enhance the implementation by
adding a &quot;count&quot; field to each node, so that when a duplicate
is added, the count is increased, and when an item is deleted, its count
is decreased (and the node isn&#39;t actually deleted until the count reaches
zero).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.3)</B>  After saving a copy of your
code from <B>(b.2)</B>, modify it to implement &quot;lazy deletion&quot;
of nodes:  Instead of actually removing a node from the tree when its count
gets to zero, just mark it as deleted (and alter the routines for searching
and adding appropriately).  This is useful in situations where the same
values enter and leave the tables repeatedly.  Turn in your final code for
this part on paper and electronically, to the ICS 141 dropbox on the Masterhit
server in the lab, labeled clearly with your name and student ID.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.4)</B>  Go back to the original binary
search tree code, before you made your modifications for parts <B>(b.2)</B>
and <B>(b.3)</B>.  Note that </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">bst-add</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
and </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">bst-delete</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
have a common structure.  Combine them, as we did with </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">find-all-matches</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
and </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">remove-all-matches</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
in the &quot;Notes on Scheme&quot; handout.  You can do this on paper; you
do not have to turn it in electronically.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.5)</B>  (extra credit)  Once lazy deletion
and a count field are implemented, handling normal (non-lazy) deletion is
just a question of doing something different when the node&#39;s count gets
to zero.  Modify your code from <B>(b.3)</B> to let the user specify when
creating the tree whether it should use lazy or normal deletion.  You&#39;d
need to modify the &quot;constructor&quot; to take another parameter (whose
value would be either </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">&#39;lazy</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
or </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">&#39;normal</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>--or,
you could make it an <I>optional</I> parameter, using normal deletion as
the default case).  You&#39;d store with each new tree an indication of
which kind of deletion it uses, and you&#39;d do that kind of deletion when
called for.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.6)</B>  (extra credit)  Allow for more
complex values (like structures) in the tree, in essence building a &quot;templated
class.&quot;  You&#39;ll need to supply key-selector and key-comparison
functions when you create a tree.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b.7)</B>  (extra credit)  Implement your
favorite tree-balancing algorithm.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c)  </B>(extra credit)  Find as many indications
as you can in the Sebesta text that Sebesta doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot;
functional programming or Scheme--that he doesn&#39;t treat Scheme as completely
or seriously as other popular languages.  Look for omissions and subtleties
in the wording. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B>  For some examples of the practical
applications of functional programming, check out the web site <A HREF="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~wadler/realworld/">Functional Programming in the Real World</A>,
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~wadler/realworld/">http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~wadler/realworld/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.
 You should also take a look at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.scheme.com">www.scheme.com</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,
which describes a Scheme implementation that claims to generate code with
the same performance as C.  There&#39;s nothing to turn in for this.</FONT></P>
