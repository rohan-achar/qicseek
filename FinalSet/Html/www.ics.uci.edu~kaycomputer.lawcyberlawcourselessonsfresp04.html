Three Levels of Protection</FONT></H1></CENTER><P><P>
 
 Say the government is acting as sovereign. The power it has to restrict speech depends on which of the three categories the speech falls into:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> -  CONSTITUTIONALLY VALUELESS SPEECH: Some speech has (close to) no constitutional protection, because the Supreme Court has concluded that it lacks constitutional value. This generally includes:<P>

<UL>
<LI>False statements of fact said by people who know the statements are false (or who show reckless disregard of the possibility of falsehood).<BR>
<LI>Obscenity (more about that later).<BR>
<LI>Child pornography.<BR> 
<LI>Statements that are intended to, and likely to, incite more or less immediate lawless conduct.<BR>
<LI>Threats.<BR>
<LI>Criminal solicitation or conspiracy.<BR>
</UL>
-  SPEECH GIVEN INTERMEDIATE PROTECTION: Some speech is protected to some extent, but not entirely:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Commercial advertising is unprotected if it's false (even negligently false) or misleading; it may also be unprotected in some other cases.<BR>
<LI> Speech that is not obscene but quite sexually explicit also has some protection, but in some respects not as much protection as "fully protected" speech.<BR>
</UL>
-  FULLY PROTECTED SPEECH: All other speech has maximum constitutional protection. This includes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Speech about politics, society, religion, philosophy, and science.<BR>
<LI>Art, literature, music, poetry.<BR>
<LI>Jokes, gossip, entertainment, and casual chit-chat.<BR>
<LI>Pretty much anything else that doesn't fall into the valueless or intermediate categories.<BR>
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
 Common MYTH: "Only political speech is fully protected." No; to be fully protected, speech doesn't have to be political or in any way exalted -- it just has to be outside the valueless or intermediate boxes.<P>
