Geometric Topology
</H2>
This area of mathematics is about the assignment of geometric structures
to topological spaces, so that they "look like"
geometric spaces.  For instance, compact two dimensional surfaces
can have a local geometry based on the sphere
(the sphere itself, and the projective plane), based
on the Euclidean plane (the torus and the Klein bottle), or based
on the <A HREF="hyper.html">hyperbolic plane</A> (all other surfaces).
Similar questions in three dimensions have more complicated answers;
Thurston showed that there are eight possible geometries,
and conjectured that all 3-manifolds can be split into pieces having
these geometries.
Computer solution of these questions by programs like SnapPea
has proved very useful in the study of <A HREF="knot.html">knot theory</A>
and other topological problems.
