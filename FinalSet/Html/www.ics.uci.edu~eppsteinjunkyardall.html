triangle so they each touch the other two and two triangle sides. This
problem has a curious history, described in Wells' <i>Penguin Dictionary
of Curious and Interesting Geometry</i>: Malfatti's original (1803)
question was to carve three columns out of a prism-shaped block of
marble with as little wasted stone as possible, but it wasn't until 1967
that it was shown that these three mutually tangent circles are never
the right answer.

The associahedron represents the set of triangulations of a hexagon,
with edges representing flips; the permutahedron represents the set of
permutations of four objects, with edges representing swaps.
This strangely asymmetric view of the associahedron (as an animated gif)
shows that it has some kind of geometric relation with the permutahedron:
it can be formed by cutting the permutahedron on two planes.

in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; <A HREF="tripack.html">my answer</A>
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, <A HREF="tripack.ps">shown below</A>.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see F&aacute;ry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

<P>Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.

a solid torus out of circles, and one can then pack tori to fill space,
leaving some uncovered gaps between the tori.)  The geometry center has

<li><a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0604.html">Packing rectangles into similar rectangles</a>.
A problem of the month from Erich Friedman's Math Magic site:
how small an aspect-ratio-r rectangle can contain n unit-area
aspect-ratio-r rectangles?
As you might hope for in a problem dealing with aspect ratios
of rectangles, the golden rectangle does show up, as one of the
breakpoints in the size function for packing five smaller rectangles.

<li><a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0903.html">Pairwise
touching hypercubes</a>.  Erich Friedman asks how to partition the unit cubes
of an a*b*c-unit rectangular box into as many connected polycubes as
possible with a shared face between every pair of polycubes.
He lists both general upper and lower bounds as functions of a, b, and
c, and specific constructions for specific sizes of box.
I've seen the same question asked for d-dimensional hypercubes
formed out of 2^d unit hypercubes; there is a lower bound of roughly
2<sup>d/2</sup> (from embedding a 2*2<sup>d/2</sup>*2<sup>d/2</sup> box
into the hypercube)
and an upper bound of O(2<sup>d/2</sup>&nbsp;sqrt&nbsp;d)
(from computing how many cubes must be in a polycube
to give it enough faces to touch all the others).

This is clearly
polynomial time: the decision problem can be solved by finding
the intersection of O(n<sup>2</sup>) shapes, each the union of two disks, so doing this
naively and applying parametric search gives O(n<sup>4</sup> polylog),
but it might be interesting to push the time bound further.

idea seems to be to define geometry-like structures (having objects

that are non-uniform in some strong sense: every Euclidean axiom
(and why not, every Euclidean theorem?) should be true at some point of
the geometry and false at some other point.

<A HREF="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg/">Greg Kuperberg</A>
discusses an algorithm for constructing the Voronoi cells in a planar
lattice of points.  This problem is closely related to some important
number theory: Euclid's algorithm for integer GCD's, continued
fractions, and good approximations of real numbers by rationals.
Higher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form
zonotopes) are much harder -- one can find a basis of
short vectors using the well-known LLL algorithm, but this doesn't
necessarily find
the vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according
to Senechal's <I>Quasicrystals and Geometry</I>, although the set
of Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not
known whether this set always contains a basis.)
