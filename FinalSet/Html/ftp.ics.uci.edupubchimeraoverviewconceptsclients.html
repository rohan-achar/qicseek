<H1><CENTER>Clients</CENTER></H1>

<P>Clients play an integral role in the Chimera architecture. They provide
users access to Chimera's hypermedia services. While clients typically contain
only one viewer, Chimera places no restrictions on the number of viewers
a client can contain. This strict separation between the notion of client
and the notion of viewer allows Chimera to efficiently model a wide variety
of application architectures ranging from single-threaded single-purpose
clients to multi-threaded commercial applications.</P>

<P>The <A NAME="obligations"></A>responsibilities of a client are distinct
from the <A HREF="viewers.html#obligations">responsibilities</A> of a viewer.
These responsibilities are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Establishing and maintaining a connection with the Chimera server.
  This includes notifying viewers of changes in the state of the connection.
  <LI>Activating viewers as appropriate in response to a user's actions.
  For instance, requesting a chart be generated from a range of spreadsheet
  data will necessitate the invocation of a chart viewer.
  <LI>Routing hypermedia events to the appropriate viewer. Hypermedia events
  arrive from the Chimera server tagged for a particular viewer. It is the
  client's responsibility to see that the event is delivered to the correct
  viewer.
</UL>

<H2>Developer Information</H2>

<P>The operations used by clients are listed below. The type <CODE>concept</CODE>
used in some of the operations below indicates that these operations are
available on all of the previous hypermedia concepts (viewers, objects,
views, anchors, and links). For more information see the <A HREF="../../dev/docs/index.html">on-line
documentation</A>.</P>

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>connect(String)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Establishes a connection to a Chimera server. The string specifies the name
of the client. The name of the client is currently unused by the system.
It is here to serve as a placeholder for potential future use by the system.
(In particular, since clients can contain multiple viewers, it must be possible
to map viewer names to their associated client name in order to invoke the
appropriate client during a delayed link traversal.)</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>connectApplet(String, String, String)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Establishes a connection to a Chimera server in the case where the client
is a Java applet. Due to the security restrictions on applets additional
information is required. In particular, the first string specifies the name
of the host from which the applet was downloaded, the second string specifies
the name of the applet's user (which the applet may have to query its user
for), while the third string specifies the name of the client, as before.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>connectHyperwebManager(String)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Once you are connected to a Chimera server, the viewer needs to connect
to a Chimera 2.0 website in order to access Chimera 2.0 hyperwebs. This
routine connects the Chimera server to the website specified by a URL passed
as a string to this routine. Note, all of a user's clients share the same
Chimera server, thus this routine determines which site is accessed by all
of a user's clients. Thus, this operation will generate an activeSite event
to all of the user's other clients informing them of the change.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>disconnect()</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Disconnects the client from its Chimera server.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>disconnectHyperwebManager()</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Disconnects the Chimera server from its currently active Chimera 2.0 website.
This will generate an activeSite event to all of the user's other clients
informing them of the change.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>clearWeb()</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Deselects the currently active hyperweb. All of the user's other clients
will be informed of the change via an activeWeb event.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>getWeb()</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Returns the name of the currently active hyperweb.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>getWebs()</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Returns the names of the available hyperwebs for the active Chimera 2.0
website. These names can then be used to select hyperwebs for manipulation
via the <CODE>setWeb()</CODE> operation.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>isHwmConnected()</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE> if the client is connected to a Chimera 2.0 website.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>lockConcept(concept)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">A client must lock a concept before performing an operation which would
change its state. This prevents two different clients from modifying the
concept at the same time. This operation is non-blocking. It will either
lock the concept and return <CODE>TRUE</CODE> or it will return <CODE>FALSE</CODE>.
If the latter, the client must enter a polling loop to determine when the
concept is available for locking. <I>The inadequacy of this locking mechanism
is well known by its developers. This mechanism is one of the primary targets
for improvement in the Chimera 2.0 beta release.</I></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>locked(concept)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE> if the specified concept is locked.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>setWeb(String)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Activates the specified hyperweb. All of a user's clients may now manipulate
this hyperweb. The user's other clients will be notified of the change by
an activeWeb event.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" NOWRAP><B>unlockConcept(concept)</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Unlocks the specified concept.</TD></TR>
