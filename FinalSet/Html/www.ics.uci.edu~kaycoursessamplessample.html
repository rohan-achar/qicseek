<TITLE>Short Sample of HTML Code</TITLE>
<!-- November 1995, Hung Tran (hungt@ics.uci.edu)
        Many thanks to Stephen Franklin for his support.
     
     These lines between <!-- and --&gt; and comprise an HTML comment.
     Like comments in Pascal, they are annotations for the human reader 
     of the source code.  Nothing in these comments appears on the 
     interpreted Web page.

Above are examples of first-level (largest) and
second-level (next-largest) headings.
<HR>
<H3>Some Examples of Lists</H3>
Here's a list of items, without numbers ("unordered"):
<UL>
<LI>The number of sites on the Web is doubling every year.
<LI>If you'd like to see
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay">David G. Kay's 
home page</A>, you can click on the hypertext link shown.
</UL>
We can have ordered or numbered lists also.<P>
<B>Top Five Reasons You're Taking ICS 1P:</B>
<OL>
<LI>What?  What's ICS 1P?
<LI>The TELE guy's smooth voice made you do it.
<LI>You heard a rumor that one of OJ's lawyers was teaching the class.
<LI>PE classes no longer give units, there's no Basketweaving 101, so this 
was the next best thing.
<LI>The School of Social Sciences made you an offer you couldn't refuse.
</OL>
<H3>General Information on HTML</H3>
<!-- The rest of this document was adapted from Stephan Franklin's
        ICS 1C sample HTML document.

<P>Paragraphs are bounded by &LT;P&GT at the start and (optionally)
&LT;/P&GT at the end.</P>
<P>Of course, lots of folks just begin paragraphs and don't
worry about ending the previous one.  That's fine.  It works.
Part of why/how it works is that lots of things in effect
end paragraphs.  Things like lists and ``Horizontal Rules.''
Here ``Rule'' just means a straight line as one sees below.
<P> The general format of bounding something by &LT;XXX&GT at the start and
&LT;/XXX&GT at the end works for setting physical styles of print as well:
<UL>
<LI><B>XXX = B for Bold</B>
<LI><I>XXX = I for Italic</I>
<LI><TT>XXX = TT for fixed width ``TeleTypewriter''</TT>
</UL>
