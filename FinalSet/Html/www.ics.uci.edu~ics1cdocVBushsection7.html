All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of
present-day mechanisms and gadgetry.  If affords an immediate step,
however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a
provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately
and automatically another.  This is the essential feature of the
memex.  The process of tying two items together is the important
thing.

<p>

When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in
his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard.  Before him are the
two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions.  At
the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a
pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item.  The user taps a
single key, and the items are permanently joined.  In each code space
appears the code word.  Out of view, but also in the code space, is
inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these
dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.

<p>

Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other
can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the
corresponding code space.  Moreover, when numerous items have been
thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn,
rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning
the pages of a book.  It is exactly as though the physical items had
been gathered together to form a new book.  It is more than this, for
any item can be joined into numerous trails.

<p>

The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and
properties of the bow and arrow.  Specifically he is studying why the
short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in
the skirmishes of the Crusades.  He has dozens of possibly pertinent
books and articles in his memex.  First he runs through an
encyclopedia, finds and interesting but sketchy article, leaves it
projected,  Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and
ties the two together.  Thus he goes, building a trail of many items.
Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into
the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item.
When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available
materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a
side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables
of physical constants.  He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his
own.  Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of
materials available to him.

<p>

And his trails do not fade.  Several years later, his talk with a
friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations,
even of vital interest.  He has an example, in the fact that the
outranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow.  In fact he
has a trail on it.  A touch brings up the code book.  Tapping a few
keys projects the head of the trail.  A lever runs through it at will,
stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions.  It is an
interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion.  So he sets a
reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it
to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into
the more general trail.
