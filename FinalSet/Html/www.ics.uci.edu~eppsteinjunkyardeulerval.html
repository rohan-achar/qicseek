<h1>Euler's Formula,
Proof 17: Valuations
</H1>

<P>This proof comes from
<a href="refs.html#KR">Klain and Rota</a>,
who develop it as part of a more general theory of
invariant measures on Euclidean spaces.
Thanks also to Robin Chapman for helping explain it to me.

<P>Let U<sup>d</sup> be the vector space of functions from <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>
to <b>R</b>, and V<sup>d</sup> be the subspace of U<sup>d</sup>
generated by characteristic functions of compact convex sets
in <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>.
We define a function &chi;<sub>d</sub> that maps V<sup>d</sup> to real numbers,
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>If d=1, for any function f in V<sup>d</sup>, let
<br><br>
<div align=center>
D&nbsp;f(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;f(x)&nbsp;-&nbsp;lim<sub>y->x<sup>+</sup></sub>f(y),
<br><br>
&chi;<sub>1</sub>(f) = sum D&nbsp;f(x)
</div>
<br><br>
(Note that this sum always has only a finite number of nonzero terms.)
<br><br>
<LI>If d>1, partition the coordinates of <b>R</b><sup>d</sup> into sets
of d-1 and 1 coordinate:
<br><br>
<div align=center>
<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<b>R</b><sup>d-1</sup>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<b>R</b>.
</div>
<br>Thus we can represent any point in <b>R</b><sup>d</sup> as a pair
(x,z) where x in <b>R</b><sup>d-1</sup> and z in <b>R</b>.
For any function f in V<sup>d</sup>,
and any z in <b>R</b>, let f<sub>z</sub> denote the restriction of f to
a (d-1)-dimensional cross-section:
f<sub>z</sub>(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;f(x,z),
so f<sub>z</sub> is a function in V<sup>d-1</sup>.
We then define
<br><br>
<div align=center>
&chi;<sub>d</sub>(f)&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum&nbsp;D&nbsp;&chi;<sub>d-1</sub>(f<sub>z</sub>).
</div>
</UL>
Because D and Sum are linear operators, &chi; is a linear function from V
to <b>R</b>.  It can also be shown by a simple induction on dimension
that, if f is the characteristic function of a compact convex set K,
then &chi;(f)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1: By induction, &chi;(f<sub>z</sub>) is the
characteristic function of a closed interval, from which it is clear
from the definition that sum&nbsp;D&nbsp;&chi;(f<sub>z</sub>) is&nbsp;1.
Thus also (since V has the characteristic
functions of convex compact sets as its basis) &chi; is well defined
independently of the choice of coordinates for <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>.

<P>If
g is the characteristic function of the relative interior of a polytope
K, it is in V<sup>d</sup> (by inclusion-exclusion of lower-dimensional
faces) and a similar induction shows that
&chi;(g)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(-1)<sup>m</sup>, where m is the dimension of K:
Because of the independence of &chi; from the coordinate system, we can assume m=d.  Each cross-section of K is itself a polytope, so by induction
&chi;(g<sub>z</sub>) is (-1)<sup>m-1</sup> times the characteristic function of an open interval, and the effect of the sum and D operators is to multiply by another factor of&nbsp;-1.

<P>Now we let K be a convex polytope, and evaluate &chi; on its characteristic function in two different ways, by partitioning K into the disjoint union of the relative interiors of its faces.  By linearity of &chi;, the sum of its values on these relative interiors must be the same as its value on all of K, that is,
<br><br>
<div align=center>
1&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum (-1)^m
</div>
<br>
where the sum is over the set of faces of K (including K itself).
Grouping the faces by their dimensions, we get a form of Euler's formula:
<br><br>
<div align=center>
1&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum&nbsp;(-1)<sup>i</sup>&nbsp;f<sub>i</sub>
</div>
<br>
where the sum runs from i=1 to the dimension of K.
