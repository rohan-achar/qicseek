Thathas happened this quarter: eachof our staff has adviser-requiredcommitments on Fridays from11 to noon and 3 to 4. Sostarting next Friday, therewill be no TA on duty Fridays11-noon or 3-4.  TAs will, as now, be on duty the rest ofthe time the Help Center is open.</p></td></table></body></html>
