<P><B>Abstract: </B>This paper introduces the problem of understanding
what software process redesign (SPR) is, and how software process modeling,
analysis and simulation may be used to support it. It provides an overview
of research results from business process redesign to help draw attention
to the importance of treating process redesign as a process of organizational
and process transformation. This in turn requires examining and practicing
SPR through an approach that combines organizational change management
together with process management technologies. A discussion follows which
then identifies a number of topic areas that require further study in order
to make SPR a subject of software process research and practice.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">1. Overview</FONT></B>

<P>Software process improvement (SPI) has traditionally been focussed on
addressing how to improve the capabilities of a software development organization
through maturing and comparative benchmarking of its software processes.
The Capability Maturity Model from the Software Engineering Institute is
the most visible SPI initiative of its kind. However, the CMM is targeted
to incremental improvement of existing software processes. The CMM top-most
level, Optimization (Level 5), characterizes those organizations whose
software processes are incrementally improved and refined through monitoring,
measurement and reflexive analysis of well-defined and well-managed processes.
Nonetheless, the CMM does not provide specific guidance or a maturity level
that implicitly prescribes how to fundamentally rethink how to optimize
software processes to achieve on the order of 10X improvement through radical
transformation. Are radical transformations of software processes the same
as incremental evolutionary improvements? Probably not, though they appear
to lie along a common dimension or metric that characterizes the scale
or scope of process change that is sought. As such, <I>software process
redesign</I> (SPR) merits investigation to determine whether and how it
might lead to dramatic improvements in process efficiency or effectiveness.

<P>The study presented in this paper introduces the topic of SPR. It describes
how concepts, techniques and tools for software process modeling, analysis
and simulation may be employed to support SPR studies. In particular, three
research questions that explore and elaborate these topics can be identified
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
what is software process redesign, and how does it relate to business process
redesign?</LI>

<LI>
how can modeling, analysis, and simulation help in redesigning software
processes?</LI>

<LI>
what approach is needed for acquiring, checking, and applying the knowledge
required to dramatically and continuously improve software processes?</LI>
</UL>
Accordingly, in the sections that follow, each of these questions is addressed,
elaborated and investigated in turn.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>2. What is software process redesign</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>SPR is concerned with identification, application and refinement of
new ways to improve software processes. Software processes of interest
include not only those associated with software development, but also those
for software system acquisition [SB98], use and evolution. Redesign heuristics
serve as the main source of knowledge for how to dramatically improve the
cycle time, defect prevention, and cost effectiveness of various kinds
of software/business processes [VS99]. However, where do these heuristics
come from? What can we learn from the results of business process redesign
(BPR) studies? Is the Web a useful source of SPR knowledge? Let us consider
each in turn.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">2.1 Where do SPR heuristics come from</FONT></I></B>

<P>SPR heuristics can be derived through empirical studies of before and
after focal processes have been redesigned [e.g., SN97]. The results of
these studies are often cast in forms such as experience reports, case
studies, lessons learned or best practices [DP98, O98], rather than from
controlled, carefully designed experiments [ZW98]. As the generalizability
of such studies is usually limited, the story, contexts and insights they
may convey can be enlightening or sensitizing. Accordingly, this is why
attention is drawn to <I>heuristic</I> knowledge to guide SPR. Nonetheless,
SPR heuristics can also be derived from theoretical propositions that characterize
how to most effectively redesign complex processes, or from patterns in
measurable properties of formal representations of processes for redesign.

<P>SPR heuristics may be domain independent and therefore applicable to
a large set of processes. Alternatively, SPR heuristics may be domain specific,
thus applicable to specific processes in particular settings. Both domain
independent and domain specific SPR heuristics are sought. In examining
how SPR heuristics are applied, we can learn the circumstances in which
different types of heuristics are most effective or least effective. Similarly,
we can learn which process redesigns are considered most effective and
desirable in the view of the participants working in the redesigned process,
or which redesigns are considered undesirable by the participants [SN97,
VS99]. However, part of the challenge in identifying SPR heuristics of
any kind is that unless they are explicit, most of these heuristics implicit.
This means they are likely to be found through comparison across a diverse
sample of redesign case studies, rather than conveniently found in a single
repository. This kind of comparative domain analysis can be a high-skill,
labor-intensive activity. Nonetheless, new technologies are creating options
that may make such activity more manageable.

<P>Therefore, it is useful to acknowledge that finding and ferreting out
SPR heuristics is a difficult task. However, a structured scheme for taxonomically
classifying SPR heuristics, or a repository populated with SPR heuristics,
are likely to be valuable assets for research purposes or commercial applications
of SPR. As such, there is motivation for finding more such heuristics,
as well as for building alternative classification taxonomies and repositories
for SPR.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">2.2 Lessons from Business Process Redesign</FONT></I></B>

<P>The work of Hammer, Davenport and their colleagues brought attention
to the problem of business process redesign (BPR) or process reengineering.
Following their advice, existing or legacy software processes should be
either (a) obliterated, not automated [H90], or else (b) understood and
measured [DS90]. In turn, innovative to-be software processes should be
designed and prototyped using leading-edge software engineering and other
information technologies (ITs) as a new foundation for coordinating software
development and use activities [DS90]. However, the ability to successfully
realize the benefits of radical IT-based changes in most business processes
has been elusive.

<P>Reflective studies of the problems, pitfalls and best practices of BPR
find that certain organizational variables, rather than IT, are key to
achieving successful BPR outcomes [BMR94, HRW93]. In many of the BPR projects
examined, BPR failure was reported to be the outcome about 70% of the time
[BMR94]. How can BPR failure be avoided when redesigning software processes?
Available research results from BPR studies indicate that critical conditions
to help realize success should include the participation and commitment
of top management executives, empowered workers, shared vision, realistic
expectations, changes in worker roles and responsibilities, new performance
measurements, worker incentives, and the like [BMR94, HRW93]. Conversely
if these organizational conditions are insignificant or missing, then we
should expect the application of BPR to software processes to fail.

<P>The dilemma of how to realize the benefits of a successful BPR project,
while avoiding the likelihood of failure, gave rise to a series of empirical
field studies and surveys to track down the source of variation and causality.
Results from representative investigations [CJS94, ESS95, GJ+95] emphasized
the importance of addressing BPR implementation within the broader context
of organizational change in a complex socio-technical environment [cf.
KS82]. For instance, some organizations may choose to reengineer a set
of processes (e.g., software life cycle processes) over time, in order
to learn from what succeeds and what fails [CJS94]. Applying a lesson learned
from Caron and colleagues [CJS94] to software process reveals that SPR
efforts should be implemented within an organization bottom-up by the process
end-users, rather than imposed top-down by senior management [cf. H90],
to succeed. Following this, senior management should provide the strategic
vision for an effort to redesign software processes that empowers process
staff to participate in directing and implementing the effort [ESS95].
Similarly, change management strategies and techniques, technological competence,
tactical planning and project management, and training personnel for to-be
processes, should be factors related to success when redesigning software
processes [GJ+97<A HREF="#GJKW95">GJKW95</A>

<P>].

<P>Drawing from the emerging theoretical basis of BPR [KG95], when redesigning
software processes, focus should be on the creation of an organizational
environment that support change management strategies. Central among them
are organizational commitments to foster a process learning and experimentation
environment, knowledge sharing supplemented with software technologies,
internal and external partnering, and measurable process improvements,
as prerequisites for BPR success. Similarly, when reengineering software
development processes, effort should be directed at enhancing the level
of team development, cooperative work, and collaborative learning [JW+97].

<P>Finally, recent studies of BPR establish ties between process change
and their consequence on organizational performance. For example, applying
the results of Guha and colleagues [GG+97], reengineering software processes
should require the creation of a learning organization where articulating
the interdependencies between the change environment, process management
and change management is the focus. Last, when redesigning software processes,
management control of organizational resources, such as software acquisition
and development process expenditures, must remain effective though perhaps
in a more streamlined manner [SN97a].

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">2.3 Can the Web help us learn about SPR?</FONT></I></B>

<P>We can all use the Web to conduct a global search and information retrieval.
Though we may find little matching a search for "software process redesign",
a search for "process redesign" or "process reengineering" will return
much more. Here we might find case studies, experience reports, best practices
or lessons learned as narrative documents posted on academic, non-profit,
or commercial sites. Clearly, the quality of the "knowledge" and results
gleaned from sources on the Web may be more erratic than those found in
system research studies. But in searching for SPR heuristics, when potentially
relevant source materials are found, hyperlinks can be used to label and
associate the connection between the materials and the heuristics they
instantiate. Subsequently, when a heuristic is potential candidate for
use in redesigning a software process, its source can be browsed and reexamined
to help determine its similarity, relevancy, trajectory or outcome. Subsequently,
as interest in SPR activities and outcomes grows, then more SPR case studies,
experience reports, lessons learned, best practices, counter-examples and
caveats may soon find their way onto the Web. Thus, SPR heuristics or SPR
knowledge repositories should be viewed as growth areas, rather than as
a topic that can be exhaustively analyzed with limited effort.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>3. How can modeling, analysis and
simulation help SPR</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>There is a growing body of studies and techniques that address the modeling,
analysis and simulation of software processes [P98]. Yet none of the extant
studies address the subject of SPR as their primary focus. However, SPR
is often implicit as a motivating factor in practical applications of software
process modeling and simulation. As such, how can modeling, analysis and
simulation of software processes be employed to directly support SPR?

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">3.1 Modeling process redesign knowledge</FONT></I></B>

<P>As already noted SPR knowledge is often cast as heuristics derived from
results of empirical or theoretical studies. These results may then be
coded as production rules for use in a rule-based system (i.e., a pattern-directed
inference system) [N97], or as tuples (records of relation attribute instance
values) that can be stored in a relational database [KS96]. Nonetheless,
these alternative representation schemes do not focus on what needs to
be modeled, which is the focus here.

<P>From a modeling standpoint, there is need to potentially model many
kinds and forms of SPR knowledge. These include (a) the process to be redesigned
in its legacy, "as-is" form before redesign, (b) the redesign heuristics
(or transformations) to be applied, (c) the "to-be" process resulting from
redesign, and (d) the empirical sources (e.g., narrative case studies)
from which the heuristics were derived. Furthermore, we might also choose
to model (e) the sequence of steps (or the "here-to-there" process) through
which different redesign heuristics were applied to progressively transform
the as-is process into its to-be outcome. Modeling the processes identified
in (a), (c) and (e) is already within the realm of process modeling and
simulation capabilities. However, (b) and (d) pose challenges not previously
addressed by software process modeling technologies. Furthermore, (b) and
(d) must be interrelated or interlinked to the process models of (a), (c)
and (e) to be of greatest value for external validation, traceability,
and incremental evolution purposes [VS99, ZW98]. Finally, software process
modeling will play a role in (f) facilitating the continuing evolution
and refinement of the SPR knowledge web.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">3.2 Analyzing processes for redesign</FONT></I></B>

<P>Software process models can be analyzed in a number of ways [MS90, SM97].
These analysis are generally targeted to improving the quality of the process
model, as well as to detect or prevent common errors and omissions that
appear in large models. Nonetheless, software process redesign poses additional
challenges when analyzing process models.

<P>First, it is necessary to analyze the consistency, completeness, traceability
and correctness of multiple, interrelated process models (as-is, here-to-there,
and to-be). This is somewhat analogous to what happens in a software development
project when multiple notations (e.g., for system specification, architectural
design, coding, and testing) are used, therefore requiring analysis across
as well as within a the software notations.

<P>Second, it is necessary to account for software process resources throughout
the redesign effort. For example, are resources that appear in an as-is
process replicated, replaced, subsumed, or removed in the to-be process?
SPR can change the flow of resources through a process, and thus we want
to observe and measure these changes on process performance.

<P>Last, one approach to determining when domain-independent process redesign
heuristics can apply results from measuring structural attributes of the
formal or internal representation (e.g., a semantic network or directed
attributed graph) of a process as index for selecting process redesign
heuristics [N97, N98, SN97]. Each of these challenges necessitates further
description and refinement, as well as characterizing how they can interact
in a simplifying or complicating manner.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">3.3 Simulating processes before, during and
after redesign</FONT></I></B>

<P>Software process models can be simulated in a number of interesting
and insightful ways using either knowledge-based, discrete-entity or system
dynamics systems [P98, S99]. However, is there still need for another type
of system to simulate processes performed by process users, and under their
control?

<P>When considering the role of simulation in supporting software process
redesign a number of challenges arise. For example, how much of a performance
improvement does an individual redesign heuristic realize? Will different
process workload or throughput characterizations lead to corresponding
variations in simulated performance in both as-is and to-be process models?
How much of a performance improvement do multiple redesign heuristics realize,
again when considered with different workloads or throughputs? Can simulation
help reveal whether all transformations should be applied at once, or whether
they should be realized through small incremental redesign improvements?
As such, simulation in the context of SPR raises new and interesting problems
requiring further investigation and experimentation.

<P>As suggested earlier, there is need to simulate not only as-is and to-be
processes but also the here-to-there transformation processes. Following
from the results in the BPR research literature, transforming an as-is
process into its to-be counterpart requires organizational change management
considerations. The process users who should be enacting and controlling
the transformation process can benefit from, and contribute to, the modeling
and analysis of as-is processes [SM97, S99]. Similarly, users can recognize
possible process pathologies when observing graphic animations of process
simulations. However, the logic of the process simulation may not be transparent
or easy to understand in terms that process users can readily comprehend.

<P>Conventional approaches to process simulation may not be empowering
to people who primarily enact software use processes [cf. SN97]. Instead,
another option may be needed: one where process users can interactively
traverse (i.e., simulate) a new to-be process, or the here-to-there process,
via a computer-supported process walk-through or fly-through. In such a
simulation, user roles are not simply modeled as objects or procedural
functions; instead, users play their own roles in order to get a first-person
view and feel for the new process. This is analogous to how "flight simulators"
are used to help train aircraft pilots. In so doing, user participation
may raise a shared awareness of which to-be alternatives make the most
sense, and how the transformations needed to transition from the as-is
to to-be process should be sequenced within the organizational setting.
As such, simulation for SPR raises the need for new approaches and person-in-the-loop
simulation environments.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>4. Approach and Results</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Given the challenges identified in the previous section on how to modeling,
analysis and simulation can support SPR, this section presents the approach
and initial results from an effort in each of these three areas.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">4.1 Modeling Approach and Results</FONT></I></B>

<P>In developing models of processes for SPR, we used two tools. First,
in order to represent SPR knowledge formally and reason with it, the Loom
knowledge representation system was selected [MB95]. Loom is a mature language
and environment for constructing ontologies and intelligent systems that
can be accessed over the Web [VR+99]. By using Loom to re-implement the
Articulator process meta-model ontology [MS90, MS96], formal models of
software (or business) processes, classification taxonomies and process
redesign heuristics can be represented and manipulated. In turn, process
knowledge can be analyzed, queried, and browsed, while relevant redesign
alternatives for processes can be identified and linked to source materials
on the Web. Nonetheless, Loom does impose a discipline for formally representing
declarative knowledge structures in terms of concepts (object or pattern
types), relations (link types that associate concept) and instances (concept,
link, attribute values).

<P>Loom's <I>deductive</I> <I>classifier</I> utilizes forward-chaining,
semantic unification and object-oriented truth maintenance technologies.
This enables it to compile the declarative knowledge into a network designed
to efficiently support on-line deductive query processing [MB95]. Further,
Loom's classifier can be used to taxonomically classify and update the
SPR knowledge base as new SPR cases are entered and formally modeled. This
in turn enables the SPR knowledge web to evolve with automated support
[VS99].

<P>Second, in order to support the visualization of the knowledge bases
and process models that have been constructed, a Web browser interface
to the Loom system called Ontosaurus is used [ON99]. Ontosaurus is a client-side
tool in which a Loom server loaded with one or more knowledge bases replies
to queries and produces Web pages describing several aspects of the knowledge
base. It is also able to provide simple facilities for producing general
queries and editing the contents of knowledge bases. Figure 1 shows a browser
window accessing Ontosaurus. The display consists of three window panels;
Toolbar (top), Reference (left side) and Content (right side). The Toolbar
panel consists of buttons to perform various operations such as <I>select
domain theory</I>, <I>display theory, save updates</I>, etc. The Reference
and Content panels are designed to display contents of a selected ontology.
Links in both panels display their contents in the Content window. This
facilitates exploring various links associated with a word or concept in
the Reference window without the need to continuously go back and forth.
The bookmark window holds user-selected links for Web pages to Ontosaurus
pages, and is managed by the buttons in the bottom of the bookmark window.

<P>We now describe how we built a knowledge-based system to represent and
diagnose models of SPR. The system is based on an ontology of business
processes expressed in Loom. Loom provides a semantic network knowledge
representation framework based on description logics. Nodes in a Loom semantic
network define <I>concepts</I> that have roles or slots to specify their
attributes. A key feature of description logic representations is that
the semantics of the representation language are very precisely specified.
This precise specification makes it possible for the classifier to determine
whether one concept <I>subsumes</I> another based solely on the formal
definitions of the two concepts. The classifier is an important tool for
evolving ontologies because it can be used to automatically organize a
set of Loom concepts into a classification hierarchy or taxonomy based
solely on their definitions. This capability is particularly important
as the ontology becomes large, since the classifier will find subsumption
relations that people might overlook, as well as modeling errors that could
make the knowledge base inconsistent.

redesign instance in the Contents window</CENTER>


<P>Overall, 30 process redesign heuristics have been identified and classified
so far. Six taxonomies have also been identified for grouping and organizing
access to the BPR cases found on the Web. These taxonomies classify and
index the cases according to:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Generic type of organization for process redesign: </I>financial, manufacturing,
research, software development, etc.</LI>

<LI>
<I>As-is "problems" with existing process: </I>off-line information processing,
workflow delays, lack of information sharing, etc.</LI>

<LI>
<I>To-be "solutions" sought for redesigned process: </I>automate off-line
information processing tasks, streamline workflow, use email and databases
to share information, etc.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Use of intranet, extranet or Web-based process redesign solutions: </I>build
intranet portal for project staff information, store version-controlled
software development objects on Web server, use HTML forms for data entry
and validation process steps, etc.</LI>

<LI>
<I>SPR how-to guidelines or lessons learned: </I>explicit methods or steps
for how to understand and model the as-is process, identify process redesign
alternatives, involve process users in selecting redesign alternatives,
etc.</LI>

<LI>
<I>SPR heuristics: </I>parallelize sequence of mutually exclusive tasks,
unfold multi-stage review/approval loops, disintermediate or flatten project
management structures, move process or data quality validation checks to
the beginning, logically centralize information that can be shared rather
than routed, etc.</LI>
</UL>
In turn, each of these taxonomies could be represented as hierarchically
nested indices of Web links to the corresponding cases. Navigation through
nested indices ("portals") is familiar to Web users. Typically, each taxonomy
indexes 60-120 cases out of the total set of more than 200 that were found
on the Web and studied. This means that some cases could appear in one
taxonomy but not another, while other cases might appear in more than one,
and still others might not appear in any of these taxonomies if they were
judged to not possess the minimal information needed for characterization
and modeling.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">4.2 Analysis Approach and Results</FONT></I></B>

<P>The first challenge in analysis processes for redesign point to three
types of problems that arise when modeling business processes. First, <I>consistency
problems</I> refer to conflicts in the specification of several properties
of a given process. For example, a typical consistency problem is to have
a process with the same name as one of its outputs (something that occurs
surprisingly often in practice, perhaps because the output is often the
most visible characteristic of a process). Second, <I>completeness problems</I>
cover incomplete specifications of the process. For instance, a typical
completeness problem occurs when we specify a process with no inputs (a
"miracle", which can produce outputs with no inputs) or no outputs (a "black
hole", where inputs disappear without generating any output). Third, <I>traceability
problems</I> are caused by incorrect specification of the origin of the
model itself: its author, the agent(s) responsible for its authoring or
update, and source materials from which it was derived. Subsequently, a
process model that is consistent, complete and traceable can be said to
be internally correct. Thus, solving these model-checking problems is required
once process models are to be formalized.

<P>One of the main reasons Loom is interesting as a formal process representation
language is its capability to represent the abstract patterns of data that
are the very definition of the problems discussed above. This capability
is useful in producing simple and readable representations of model-checking
analyses. For example, it is possible to define incomplete process model
in plain English as "a process with no outputs", or as a<FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">
black-hole</FONT>. This can be described in Loom as a process that provides
exactly zero resources:

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">(defconcept black-hole</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">:is (:and process</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">(:exactly 0 process-provide-resource)))</FONT>

<P>Using the process modeling representations discussed above, the user
describes a process model through Ontosaurus for processing by Loom. Then
the system diagnoses the model provided. One of the advantages of using
Loom is that once we define an instance, Loom automatically applies its
classifier engine to find out what concepts match and apply to that instance.
This offers a big advantage, since there is no need to specify an algorithm
for the analysis process: instead, process models are analyzed automatically
as a new model is specified. In addition, the classifier performs truth-maintenance.
Therefore, if process model is updated to correct a problem found by the
system, the classifier will immediately retract the assertion that the
problem applies to that process. Thus, the classifier automates this knowledge
maintenance activity.

<P>In order to provide a more direct interface to the diagnosis system,
the Ontosaurus browser was extended to display two new types of pages.
The first displays a description of process in a less Loom-specific way
(e.g., for reporting purposes). The second displays a list of all problems
found in the current process model we input. Figure 2 shows a screenshot
of the Web page constructed by the server to describe the problems found
in a model of a sample process.

<P>The other two challenges for analyzing processes to support SPR can
be addressed with a common capability that builds on the one just described.
Since a formal representation of a software process model can be viewed
as a semantic network or directed attributed graph, it is possible to measure
the complexity attributes of the network/graph as a basis for graph transformation,
simplification or optimization. This means that measures of a richly attributed
"process flow chart" could reveal attributes such as the number of process
steps, the length of sequential process segments, the degree of parallelism
in process control flow, and others [N97, N98]. Subsequently, redesign
heuristics can be coded as patterns in the structure of a process representation.
In turn, it then becomes possible to cast a process redesign heuristic
as a production rule (or pattern-directed inference rule) whose antecedent
stipulates a process complexity measure pattern, and whose consequent specifies
the optimization transformation to be applied to the process representation
[N98]. For example, when analyzing a software process model, if a sequence
of process steps has linear flow and the inputs and outputs of the steps
are mutual exclusive, then the process steps can be performed in parallel.
Such a transformation reduces the time required to execute the redesigned
process sequence.

<P>Thus, process analysis for SPR can focus on measurement of attributes
of a formal representation of a software process model that is internally
correct. This is similar to how compilers perform code optimizations during
compilation, after parsing and semantic analysis while prior to code generation.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">4.3 Simulation Approach and Results</FONT></I></B>

<P>Questions pertaining to simulated process throughput performance or
user workloads before/after process redesign can already be addressed by
process simulation tools and techniques [P98, S99]. No significant advances
are required for this. Similarly, knowledge-based simulation capabilities
can be employed to determine process performance improvements when multiple
redesign heuristics are used to create alternative scenarios for software
process enactment [cf. CJS94, S99]. Nonetheless, the challenge of how to
support the transformation of as-is software processes into to-be redesigned
alternatives is not addressed by existing process simulation approaches;
thus a new direction is required.

<P>One key requirement for managing the organizational transformation to
a redesigned software process is the engagement, motivation and empowerment
of process users. The goal is to enable these users to direct and control
process redesign efforts, as well as to select the process redesign alternatives
for implementation and enactment. As the direct use of available simulation
packages may present an obstacle to many process users, another means to
support process management and change management is needed.

<P>The approach we choose was to engage a process user community in a multi-site
organizational setting and partner with them in redesigning their software
use processes [SN97]. In particular, we developed, provided and demonstrated
a prototype wide-area process walkthrough simulator that would enable the
process redesign participants with a means to model, redesign and walkthrough
processes that span multiple settings accessed over the Internet. With
this environment, 10 process redesign heuristics were found applicable,
while the process users chose 9 to implement [SN97]. In so doing, they
eventually achieved a factor of 10X in cycle time reduction, and reductions
in the number of process steps between 2-1 and 10-1 in the software use
processes that were redesigned [SN97]. A process simulator played a central
role in the redesign, demonstration and prototyping of these processes.
How was this realized?

<P><I>Process prototyping </I>is a computer-supported technique for enabling
software process models to be enacted without integrating the tools and
artifacts required by the modeled process [SM97]. It allows process users
the ability to interactively observe and browse a process model, step by
step, across all levels of process decomposition modeled, using a common
Web browser as its graphic user interface. Creating a basic process execution
run-time environment entails taking a prototyped process model and integrating
the tools as helper applications that manipulate process task artifacts
attached to (manually or automatically) generated Web/intranet hyperlinks
(URLs) [NS99]. Consider the following example of a simple software development
process displayed in Figure 3.

<P><B>Figure 3</B>: A simple software development process depicted as a
directed graph

<P>This process can be modeled in terms of the process flow (precedence
relations) and decomposition. It can also be attributed with user roles,
tools and artifacts for each process step. Further, as suggested above,
the directed attributed graph that constitutes the internal representation
of the process can be viewed and browsed as a hyperlinked structure that
can be navigated with a Web browser. The resulting capability allows process
users the ability to traverse or walkthrough the modeled process, task
by task, according to the modeled process's control flow. This in turn
realizes a Web-based or intranet-based process simulator system. Figure
4 provides a view of a set of artifacts that might be associated with the
process in Figure 3. Figure 5 provides a similar view of a selected task
("edit"), tool (the Emacs editor), and artifact (loaded in the Emacs edit
buffer) associated with a user role as a "developer" (not shown). In addition,
the lower right frame in Figure 5 displays a record of the history of process
task events that have transpired so far.

<P>Using this process prototyping technology, we could work with process
users to iteratively and incrementally model their as-is or to-be processes.
Subsequently, modeled processes could then be interactively traversed using
a Web browser interface to the resulting process simulator. Process users,
independent of the time or location of their access to the process model,
could then provide feedback, refinement or evaluation of what they saw
in the Web-based process simulator.

<P>Simulators are successful in helping process users to learn about the
operational sequences of problem-solving tasks that constitute a software
process [cf. KG95, GG+97]. Flight simulators have already demonstrated
this same result many times over with flight operations process users (aircraft
pilots). Process walkthrough simulators can identify potential patterns
of software process user behavior, as well as potential performance or
workflow bottlenecks in their use. This information in turn can help to
identify parameter values for a discrete-event simulation of the same process.
However, this has not yet been attempted.

<P>Overall, discrete-event and knowledge-based simulation systems, together
with process walkthrough simulators, constitute a learning, knowledge sharing,
measurement and experimentation environment that can support and empower
process users when redesigning their software processes [cf. BMR94, KG95,
GG+97]. Therefore, these process simulation capabilities, together with
other organizational change management techniques, should help minimize
the risk of failure when redesigning software processes used in complex
organizational settings.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">5. Discussion</FONT></B>

<P>Given the introduction to the subject of SPR, explanation of what it
is, explanation of how software process modeling, analysis and simulation
fit it, and demonstrated how it can operate through examples, there is
still more work to be done. Thus, the purpose of this discussion is to
identify some of the future needs that have become apparent from this investigation.

<P>First, whether dealing with a real software process in a real-world
setting, or when browsing one found on the Web, capturing, formalizing
or otherwise modeling as-is processes is cumbersome. Part of the problem
at hand is that most organizations lack explicit, well-defined or well-managed
processes as the starting point for an SPR effort. Consequently, attention
is often directed to focus only on creation of to-be alternatives, without
establishing an as-is baseline. Without a baseline, SPR efforts will increase
their likelihood of failure [BMR94, DS90, GK95, HRW93]. Thus, there is
need for new ways and means for the rapid capture and codification of as-is
software processes to facilitate SPR.

<P>Second, there is need for rapid generation of to-be and here-to-there
processes and models. SPR heuristics, as well as the tools and techniques
for acquiring and applying them appear to have significant face value.
They can help to more rapidly produce to-be process alternatives. However,
knowledge for how to construct or enact the here-to-there transformation
process in a way that incorporates change management techniques and process
management tools is an open problem. Further study is needed here.

<P>Third, SPR heuristics or transformation taxonomies may serve as a foundation
for developing a theoretical framework for how to best represent SPR knowledge.
Similarly, such a framework should stipulate what kinds of software process
concepts, links and instances should be represented, modeled and analyzed
to facilitate SPR. Nonetheless, there is also a practical need to design
and tailor SPR taxonomies to specific software process domains and organizational
settings. At this point, it is unclear whether heuristics for redesigning
software use processes are equally applicable to software acquisition,
development or evolution processes. The same can be said for any other
combination of these types of software processes.

<P>Fourth, in the preceding section, software tools supporting the modeling,
analysis and simulation of software processes for redesign were introduced.
However, these tools were not developed from the start as a single, integrated
environment. Thus their capabilities can be demonstrated to help elucidate
what is possible. But what is possible is not practical for widespread
deployment or production usage. Thus, there is a need for new environments
that support the modeling, analysis and simulation of software processes
that can be redesigned, life cycle engineered [SM97], and continuously
improved from knowledge automatically captured from the Web.

<P>Last, as highlighted in the results from BPR research studies, and from
first-hand experience [SN97], process users need to be involved in redesigning
their own processes. Accordingly, the temptation to seek fully automated
approaches to generating alternative to-be process designs from the analysis
of an as-is process model must be mitigated. The question here is to understand
when or if fully automated SPR is desirable, and in what kinds of organizational
settings. For example, there can be SPR situations where automated redesign
may not be a suitable goal or outcome. This is in organizational settings
where process users seek empowerment and involvement in redesigning and
controlling their process structures and workflow. In settings such as
these, the ability to access, search/query, select and evaluate possible
process redesign alternatives through a through the system capabilities
described above may be more desirable [cf. SN97]. Thus the ultimate purpose
of support environment for SPR may be in <I>supporting</I> <I>and empowering</I>
process users to direct the redesign of their processes, rather than in
automating SPR.

<P>Beyond this, one of the goals of SPR should be to minimize the risk
of a failed SPR effort. Solutions that focus exclusively on development
technology-driven or technology-only approaches to SPR seemed doomed to
fail. Thus, there remains a challenge for those that choose the technology
path to SPR to effectively demonstrate how such an approach can succeed,
in what kinds of organizational settings, and with what kinds of skilled
process participants.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>6. Conclusions</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>This paper addresses three research questions that identify and describe
what software process redesign is, how software process modeling and simulation
fit in, and what an approach to SPR might look like. SPR is proposed as
a technique for achieving radical, order-of-magnitude improvements or reductions
in software process attributes. SPR builds on empirical and theoretical
results in the area of business process reengineering. However, it also
builds on knowledge that can be gathered from the Web. Though the quality
of such knowledge is more variable, the sources from which it is derived--experience
reports, case studies, lessons learned, best practices and similar narratives--can
be formally represented, hyperlinked and browsed during subsequent use
or reuse. A central result from the knowledge collected so far is that
SPR must combine its focus to both techniques for changing the organization
where software processes are to be redesigned, as well as for identifying
how software engineering and information technology-based process management
tools and concepts can be applied.

<P>Software process modeling, analysis, and simulation technology can be
successfully employed to support SPR. In particular, knowledge-based tools,
techniques and concepts appear to offer a promising avenue for exploration
and application in this regard. However, new process modeling, analysis
and simulation challenges have been also identified. These give rise to
the need to investigate new tools and techniques for capturing, representing
and utilizing new forms of process knowledge. Knowledge such as SPR heuristics
can play a central role in rapidly identifying process redesign alternatives.
Software process simulation techniques in particular may require support
for person-driven process simulations, which enable process users to observe,
walk-through or fly-through process redesign alternatives. Finally, software
process modeling, analysis and simulation capabilities that support SPR
activities, may be deployed so as to engage and facilitate the needs of
users who share processes across multiple organizational settings, using
mechanisms that can be deployed on the Web.

<P>Last, an approach to SPR that utilizes Web-based tools for software
process modeling, analysis, and person-driven simulation has been presented.
Initial experiences in using these tools, together with the business process
reengineering and change management techniques they embody, indicates that
the objective of order-of-magnitude reductions in software process cycle
time and process steps can be demonstrated and achieved in complex organizational
settings. Whether results such as these can be replicated in all classes
of software processes--acquisition, development, usage, and evolution--remains
the subject of further investigation. Similarly, other research problems
have been identified for how or where advances in software process modeling
and simulation can lead to further experimental studies and theoretical
developments in the art and practice of software process redesign.
