	The classic defined-word scheme was developed over 30 years
ago in Huffman's well-known paper on minimum-redundancy coding 
[Huffman 1952].  Huffman's algorithm provided the first solution 
to the problem of constructing minimum-redundancy codes.  
Many people believe that Huffman coding cannot be improved upon, that
is, that it is guaranteed to achieve the best possible compression 
ratio.  This is only
true, however, under the constraints that each source message is
mapped to a unique codeword and that the compressed text is the
concatenation of the codewords for the source messages.
An earlier
algorithm, due independently to Shannon and Fano [Shannon and Weaver
1949; Fano 1949], is not guaranteed to provide optimal codes, but 
approaches optimal behavior as the number of messages approaches
infinity.
The Huffman algorithm is also of importance because it has provided
a foundation upon which other data compression techniques 
have built and a benchmark to which they may be compared.  
We classify the codes generated by the Huffman and 
Shannon-Fano algorithms as variable-variable
and note that they include block-variable codes as a special case,
depending upon how the source messages are defined.
<P>
In <a href="#Sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a> codes which map the integers onto binary codewords
are discussed.  Since any finite alphabet may be enumerated, this type
of code has general-purpose utility.  However, a more common use of these
codes (called universal codes) is in conjunction with an adaptive 
scheme.  This connection is discussed in
<a href="DC-Sec5.html#Sec_5.2">Section 5.2</a>.
<P>
Arithmetic coding, presented in
<a href="#Sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>, takes a significantly 
different approach to data compression from that of the other static
methods.  It does not construct a code, in the sense of a mapping from
source messages to codewords.  Instead, arithmetic coding replaces
the source ensemble by a code string which, unlike all of the other
codes discussed here, is not the concatenation of codewords 
corresponding to individual source messages.  Arithmetic coding is
capable of achieving compression results which are arbitrarily close
to the entropy of the source.

<a name="Sec_3.1">
<H3> 3.1  Shannon-Fano Coding</H3> </a>

	The Shannon-Fano technique has as an advantage its simplicity.
The code is constructed as follows:  the source messages <VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) and their
probabilities <VAR>p</VAR>( <VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) ) are listed in order of nonincreasing probability.
This list is then divided in such a way as to form two groups of as
nearly equal total probabilities as possible.  Each message in the first
group receives 0 as the first digit of its codeword; the messages
in the second half have codewords beginning with 1.  Each of these
groups is then divided according to the same criterion and
additional code digits are appended.  The process is continued until
each subset contains only one message.  Clearly the Shannon-Fano
algorithm yields a minimal prefix code.

</PRE>

	Figure 3.1 shows the application of the method to a particularly
simple probability distribution.  The length of each
codeword <VAR>x</VAR> is equal to -lg p(<VAR>x</VAR>).  This is true as long as it
is possible to divide the list into subgroups of exactly equal
probability.  When this is not possible, some codewords may be
of length -lg <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>x</VAR>)+1.  The Shannon-Fano algorithm yields
an average codeword length <VAR>S</VAR> which satisfies  H &lt;= S &lt;= H + 1.
In Figure 3.2, the Shannon-Fano code for ensemble <VAR>EXAMPLE</VAR> is
given.  As is often the case, the average codeword length is the
same as that achieved by the Huffman code (see Figure 1.3). 
That the Shannon-Fano algorithm is not guaranteed to produce
an optimal code is demonstrated by the following set of probabilities:
{ .35, .17, .17, .16, .15 }.  The Shannon-Fano code for
this distribution is compared with the Huffman code in
<a href="#Sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

<H3> 3.2.  Static Huffman Coding</H3> </a>

	Huffman's algorithm, expressed graphically, takes as input
a list of nonnegative weights {<VAR>w</VAR>(1), ... ,<VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) } and constructs
a full binary tree [a binary tree is full if every
node has either zero or two children]
whose leaves are labeled with 
the weights.  When the Huffman algorithm is used to construct a code,
the weights represent the probabilities associated with
the source letters.  Initially there is a set of singleton trees, one for
each weight in the list.  At each step in the algorithm the trees
corresponding to the two 
smallest weights, <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) and <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>j</VAR>), are merged into a new tree whose
weight is <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>)+<VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>j</VAR>) and whose root has two children which
are the subtrees represented 
by <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) and <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>j</VAR>).  The weights <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) and <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>j</VAR>) are removed from the
list and <VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>)+<VAR>w</VAR>(<VAR>j</VAR>) is inserted into the list.  This process
continues until the weight list contains a single value.  If, at
any time, there is more than one way to choose a smallest pair
of weights, any such pair may be chosen.  In Huffman's paper, 
the process begins with a nonincreasing list of weights.  This
detail is not important to the correctness of the
algorithm, but it does provide a more efficient implementation [Huffman 1952].
The Huffman algorithm is demonstrated in Figure 3.3.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DC-fig33.gif" ALT="[FIGURE 3.3]">

Figure 3.3 -- The Huffman process: (a) The list; (b) the tree.
<P>
	The Huffman algorithm determines the lengths of the codewords
to be mapped to each of the source letters <VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>).  There are many
alternatives for specifying the actual digits; it is necessary only
that the code have the prefix property.  The usual assignment
entails labeling the edge from each parent to its left child with
the digit 0 and the edge to the right child with 1.  The codeword for
each source letter is the sequence of labels along the path from
the root to the leaf node representing that letter.
The codewords for the source of Figure 3.3,
in order of decreasing probability, are
{01,11,001,100,101,000,0001}.
Clearly, this
process yields a minimal prefix code.  Further, the algorithm is 
guaranteed to produce an <EM>optimal</EM> (minimum redundancy) code [Huffman 1952].  Gallager 
has proved an upper bound on the redundancy of a Huffman code of
<VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) + lg [(2 lg <VAR>e</VAR>)/<VAR>e</VAR>] which is approximately <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) + 0.086,
where <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) is the probability of the least likely source message
[Gallager 1978].  In a recent paper, Capocelli et al. provide new
bounds which are tighter than those of Gallagher for some probability
distributions [Capocelli et al. 1986].  
Figure 3.4 shows a distribution for which the
Huffman code is optimal while the Shannon-Fano code is not.
<P>
	In addition to the fact that there are
many ways of forming codewords of appropriate lengths, there are
cases in which the Huffman algorithm does not uniquely determine
these lengths due to the arbitrary choice among equal
minimum weights.
As an example, codes with codeword lengths of {1,2,3,4,4}
and of {2,2,2,3,3} both yield the same average codeword length
for a source with probabilities {.4,.2,.2,.1,.1}.
Schwartz defines a variation of the Huffman algorithm which
performs "bottom merging"; that is, orders a new parent node
above existing nodes of the same weight and always merges the last
two weights in the list.  The code constructed is the Huffman code
with minimum values of maximum codeword length (MAX{ <VAR>l</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) }) and 
total codeword length (SUM{ <VAR>l</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) }) [Schwartz 1964]. Schwartz
and Kallick describe an implementation of Huffman's algorithm with
bottom merging [Schwartz and Kallick 1964].  The Schwartz-Kallick
algorithm and a later algorithm by Connell [Connell 1973]
use Huffman's procedure to determine the lengths of the codewords,
and actual digits are assigned so that the code has the <EM>numerical
sequence property</EM>.  That is, codewords of equal length form a 
consecutive sequence of binary numbers.
Shannon-Fano codes also have the numerical
sequence property.  This property can be exploited to achieve a compact representation
of the code and rapid encoding and decoding.

  Both the Huffman and the Shannon-Fano mappings can be 
generated in <VAR>O</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) time,
where <VAR>n</VAR> is the number of messages in the
source ensemble (assuming that the weights have been presorted).  
Each of these algorithms maps a source 
message <VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) with probability <VAR>p</VAR> to a codeword of length <VAR>l</VAR> 
(-lg <VAR>p</VAR> &lt;= l &lt;= - lg <VAR>p</VAR> + 1).  Encoding and decoding times
depend upon the representation of the mapping.  If the
mapping is stored as a binary tree, then decoding the codeword for
<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) involves following a path of length <VAR>l</VAR> in the tree.  
A table indexed by the source messages could be used for
encoding; the code for <VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) would be stored in position <VAR>i</VAR> of
the table and encoding time would be <VAR>O</VAR>(<VAR>l</VAR>).  
Connell's algorithm makes use of the <EM>index</EM>
of the Huffman code, a representation of the distribution of
codeword lengths, to encode and decode in <VAR>O</VAR>(<VAR>c</VAR>) time where <VAR>c</VAR> is the
number of different codeword lengths.  Tanaka presents an implementation
of Huffman coding based on finite-state machines which can be realized
efficiently in either hardware or software [Tanaka 1987].
<P>
	As noted earlier, the 
redundancy bound for Shannon-Fano codes is 1 and the bound for 
the Huffman method is <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR> + 0.086 where <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) is the probability of the 
least likely source message (so <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) is less than or equal to .5, 
and generally much less).  It is important to note that in defining 
redundancy to be average codeword length minus
entropy, the cost of transmitting the code mapping computed by 
these algorithms is ignored.   The overhead cost for any method
where the source alphabet has not been established prior to 
transmission includes <VAR>n</VAR> lg <VAR>n</VAR> bits for sending the <VAR>n</VAR> source
letters.  For a Shannon-Fano code, a list of codewords
ordered so as to correspond to the source letters could be 
transmitted.  The additional time required is then SUM <VAR>l</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>),
where the <VAR>l</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) are the lengths of
the codewords.  For Huffman coding, an encoding of the shape of
the code tree might be transmitted.  Since any full binary tree may 
be a legal Huffman
code tree, encoding tree shape may require as many as lg 4^<VAR>n</VAR> = 2<VAR>n</VAR> bits.
In most cases the message ensemble is very large, so that the
number of bits of overhead is minute by comparison to the total
length of the encoded transmission.  However, it is imprudent to ignore
this cost.
<P>
	If a less-than-optimal code is acceptable, the overhead costs
can be avoided through a prior agreement by sender and receiver as to
the code mapping.  Rather than using a Huffman code based upon the
characteristics of the current message ensemble, the code
used could be based on statistics for a class of
transmissions to which the current ensemble is assumed
to belong.
That is, both sender and receiver could have access to
a <EM>codebook</EM> with <VAR>k</VAR> mappings in it; one for Pascal source, one for
English text, etc.  The sender would then simply alert the receiver
as to which of the common codes he is using.  This requires only
lg <VAR>k</VAR> bits of overhead.  Assuming that classes of transmission with
relatively stable characteristics could be identified, this hybrid approach
would greatly reduce the redundancy due to overhead without
significantly increasing expected codeword length.
In addition, the cost of computing the mapping would be amortized 
over all files of a given class.  That is, the mapping would be 
computed once on a statistically significant sample and then 
used on a great number of files for which the sample is 
representative.  There is clearly a substantial risk associated 
with assumptions about file characteristics and great care would 
be necessary in choosing both the sample from which the mapping 
is to be derived and the categories into which to partition 
transmissions.  An extreme example of the risk associated 
with the codebook approach is provided by author Ernest V. 
Wright who wrote a novel <EM>Gadsby</EM> (1939) containing no 
occurrences of the letter E.  Since E is the most commonly used 
letter in the English language, an encoding based upon a sample 
from <EM>Gadsby</EM> would be disastrous if used with "normal"
examples of English text.  Similarly, the "normal" encoding
would provide poor compression of <EM>Gadsby</EM>.
<P>
	McIntyre and Pechura describe an experiment in which 
the codebook approach is compared to static Huffman coding
[McIntyre and Pechura 1985].  The sample used for comparison
is a collection of 530 source programs in four languages.
The codebook contains a Pascal code tree, a FORTRAN code tree,
a COBOL code tree, a PL/1 code tree, and an ALL code tree.
The Pascal code tree is the result of applying the static Huffman
algorithm to the combined character 
frequencies of all of the Pascal programs in the sample.
The ALL code tree is based upon the combined character frequencies
for all of the programs.  The experiment involves encoding each
of the programs using the five codes in the codebook and the static 
Huffman algorithm.  The data reported for each of the 530 programs
consists of the size of the coded program for each of the five
predetermined codes, and the size of the coded program plus the
size of the mapping (in table form) for the static Huffman method. 
In every case, the code tree for the language class to which the 
program belongs generates the most compact encoding.  Although using
the Huffman algorithm on the program itself yields an optimal
mapping, the overhead cost is greater than the added redundancy
incurred by the less-than-optimal code.
In many cases, the ALL code tree also generates a more compact encoding
than the static Huffman algorithm.  In the worst case, an
encoding constructed from the codebook is only 6.6% larger
than that constructed by the Huffman algorithm.  These results
suggest that, for files of source code, the codebook approach
may be appropriate.
<P>
	Gilbert discusses the construction of Huffman codes
based on inaccurate source probabilities [Gilbert 1971].
A simple solution to the problem of incomplete knowledge of
the source is to avoid long codewords, thereby minimizing the
error of underestimating badly the probability of a message.
The problem becomes one of constructing the optimal binary
tree subject to a height restriction (see [Knuth 1971; Hu and 
Tan 1972; Garey 1974]).  Another approach involves collecting 
statistics for several sources and then constructing a code based 
upon some combined criterion.  This approach could be applied to the
problem of designing a single code for use with English, French, German,
etc., sources.  To accomplish this, Huffman's algorithm could be used to
minimize either the average codeword length for the combined source
probabilities; or the average codeword length for English,
subject to constraints on average codeword lengths
for the other sources. 

<a name="Sec_3.3">
<H3> 3.3  Universal Codes and Representations of the Integers</H3> </a>

A code is <EM>universal</EM> if it maps source messages to codewords
so that the resulting average codeword length is bounded by <VAR>c1</VAR>(<VAR>H</VAR> + <VAR>c2</VAR>).
That is, given an arbitrary source with nonzero entropy, a universal
code achieves average codeword length which is at most a constant times
the optimal possible for that source.  The potential compression offered
by a universal code clearly depends on the magnitudes of the constants
<VAR>c1</VAR> and <VAR>c2</VAR>.  We recall the definition of an asymptotically optimal
code as one for which average codeword length approaches entropy and remark
that a universal code with <VAR>c1</VAR>=1 is asymptotically optimal.
<P>
An advantage of universal codes over Huffman codes
is that it is not necessary to know the exact probabilities with
which the source messages appear.  While Huffman coding is not
applicable unless the probabilities are known, it is sufficient
in the case of universal coding to know the probability distribution
only to the extent that the source messages can be ranked in probability
order.  By mapping messages in order of decreasing
probability to codewords in order of increasing length, universality
can be achieved.  Another advantage to universal codes is that
the codeword sets are fixed.  It is not necessary to compute a codeword
set based upon the statistics of an ensemble; any universal codeword
set will suffice as long as the source messages are ranked.  The
encoding and decoding processes are thus simplified. 
While universal codes can be used instead of
Huffman codes as general-purpose static schemes, the more common 
application is as an adjunct to a dynamic scheme.  This type of
application will be demonstrated in
<a href="DC-Sec5.html#Sec_5">Section 5</a>.
<P>
Since the ranking of source messages is the essential parameter
in universal coding, we may think of a universal code as 
representing an enumeration of the source messages, or as
representing the integers, which provide an enumeration.
Elias defines a sequence of universal coding schemes which map the
set of positive
integers onto the set of binary codewords [Elias 1975].

	The first Elias code is one which
is simple but not optimal.  This code, <VAR>gamma</VAR>, maps an integer
<VAR>x</VAR> onto the binary value of <VAR>x</VAR> prefaced by floor( lg <VAR>x</VAR>)
zeros.  The binary value of <VAR>x</VAR> is expressed in as few bits as possible,
and therefore begins with a 1, which serves to
delimit the prefix.  The result is an instantaneously decodable code 
since the total length of a codeword is exactly one greater than 
twice the number of zeros in the prefix; therefore, as soon as the first
1 of a codeword is encountered, its length is known.  
The code is not a minimum redundancy code since 
the ratio of expected codeword length to entropy goes to 2 as 
entropy approaches infinity.  The second code, <VAR>delta</VAR>, maps
an integer <VAR>x</VAR> to a codeword consisting of
<VAR>gamma</VAR> (floor[lg <VAR>x</VAR>] +1)
followed by the binary value of <VAR>x</VAR> with the leading
1 deleted.  The resulting codeword has length
floor[lg <VAR>x</VAR>] + 2 floor[lg (1 + floor[lg <VAR>x</VAR>] ) ] + 1.  This
concept can be applied recursively to shorten the codeword lengths,
but the benefits decrease rapidly.  The code <VAR>delta</VAR> is asymptotically
optimal since the limit of the ratio of expected codeword length to entropy
is 1.  Figure 3.5 lists the values of <VAR>gamma</VAR> and <VAR>delta</VAR> for a
sampling of the integers.  Figure 3.6 shows an Elias code for string
<VAR>EXAMPLE</VAR>.  The number of bits transmitted using this mapping would
be 161, which does not compare well with the 117 bits transmitted by
the Huffman code of Figure 1.3.  Huffman coding is optimal under the static
mapping model.  Even an asymptotically optimal universal code cannot
compare with static Huffman coding on a source for which the 
probabilities of the messages are known.

A second sequence of universal coding schemes, based on the Fibonacci
numbers, is defined by  Apostolico and Fraenkel [Apostolico and 
Fraenkel 1985].   While the Fibonacci codes are not asymptotically
optimal, they compare well to the Elias codes as long as the number
of source messages is not too large.  Fibonacci codes have the
additional attribute of robustness, which manifests itself by the
local containment of errors.  This aspect of Fibonacci codes will
be discussed further in
<a href="DC-Sec678.html#Sec_7">Section 7</a>.
<P>
The sequence of Fibonacci codes described by Apostolico and Fraenkel
is based on the Fibonacci numbers of order <VAR>m</VAR> &gt;= 2, where the
Fibonacci numbers of order 2 are the standard Fibonacci numbers:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....  In general, the Fibonnaci numbers
of order <VAR>m</VAR> are defined by the recurrence:  Fibonacci numbers <VAR>F</VAR>(-<VAR>m</VAR>+1)
through <VAR>F</VAR>(0) are equal to 1; the <VAR>k</VAR>th number for <VAR>k</VAR> &gt;= 1 is 
the sum of the preceding <VAR>m</VAR> numbers.  We describe only the order 
2 Fibonacci code; the extension to higher orders is straightforward.

of the form <VAR>R</VAR>(<VAR>N</VAR>) = SUM(<VAR>i</VAR>=0 to <VAR>k</VAR>) <VAR>d</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) <VAR>F</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) (where <VAR>d</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) is in {0,1},
<VAR>k</VAR> &lt;= <VAR>N</VAR>, and the <VAR>F</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>)
are the order 2 Fibonacci numbers as 
defined above) such that there are no adjacent ones in the representation.
The Fibonacci representations for a small sampling of the integers
are shown in Figure 3.7, using the standard bit sequence, from high
order to low.  The bottom row of the figure gives the values of the
bit positions.  It is immediately obvious that this Fibonacci 
representation does not constitute a prefix code.  The order 2 
Fibonacci code for <VAR>N</VAR> is defined to be:
<VAR>F</VAR>(<VAR>N</VAR>)=<VAR>D</VAR>1 where <VAR>D</VAR>=d(0)d(1)d(2)...d(<VAR>k</VAR>)
(the <VAR>d</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) defined above).  That is, the Fibonacci representation is
reversed and 1 is appended.  The Fibonacci code values for a small
subset of the integers are given in Figure 3.7.  These binary
codewords form a prefix code since every codeword now terminates
in two consecutive ones, which cannot appear anywhere else in a
codeword.  
<P>
Fraenkel and Klein prove that the Fibonacci code of order 2 is universal,
with <VAR>c1</VAR>=2 and <VAR>c2</VAR>=3 [Fraenkel and Klein 1985].  It is not asymptotically
optimal since <VAR>c1</VAR>&gt;1.  Fraenkel and Klein also show that Fibonacci
codes of higher order compress better than the order 2 code if the
source language is large enough (i.e., the number of distinct source messages
is large) and the probability distribution is nearly uniform.
However, no Fibonacci code is asymptotically optimal.  The Elias 
codeword <VAR>delta</VAR>(<VAR>N</VAR>) is asymptotically shorter than any Fibonacci
codeword for <VAR>N</VAR>, but the integers in a very large initial range have
shorter Fibonacci codewords.  For <VAR>m</VAR>=2, for example, the 
transition point is <VAR>N</VAR>=514,228 [Apostolico and Fraenkel 1985].  
Thus, a Fibonacci code provides better compression
than the Elias code until the size of the source language becomes very
large.  Figure 3.8 shows a Fibonacci code for string <VAR>EXAMPLE</VAR>.
The number of bits transmitted using this mapping would be 153, which
is an improvement over the Elias code of Figure 3.6 but still 
compares poorly with the Huffman code of Figure 1.3.

<H3> 3.4 Arithmetic Coding</H3> </a>

The method of arithmetic coding was suggested by Elias, and presented
by Abramson in his text on Information Theory [Abramson 1963].
Implementations of Elias' technique were developed by Rissanen, Pasco,
Rubin, and, most recently, Witten et al. [Rissanen 1976; Pasco 1976;
Rubin 1979; Witten et al. 1987].  We present the concept of arithmetic
coding first and follow with a discussion of implementation details 
and performance.
<P>
In arithmetic coding a source ensemble is represented by an interval
between 0 and 1 on the real number line.  Each symbol of the ensemble
narrows this interval.  As the interval becomes smaller, the number of
bits needed to specify it grows.  Arithmetic coding assumes an explicit
probabilistic model of the source.  It is a defined-word scheme which
uses the probabilities of the source messages to successively narrow
the interval used to represent the ensemble.  A high probability
message narrows the interval less than a low probability message, so
that high probability messages contribute fewer bits to the coded ensemble.
The method begins with an unordered list of source messages and their
probabilities.  The number line is partitioned into subintervals based on
cumulative probabilities.  
<P>
A small example will be used to illustrate the idea of arithmetic coding.
Given source messages {<VAR>A,B,C,D,#</VAR>} with probabilities 
{.2, .4, .1, .2, .1}, Figure 3.9 demonstrates the initial partitioning
of the number line.  The symbol <VAR>A</VAR> corresponds to the first 1/5 of
the interval [0,1); <VAR>B</VAR> the next 2/5; <VAR>D</VAR> the subinterval of size
1/5 which begins 70% of the way from the left endpoint to the right.
When encoding begins, the source ensemble is represented by the entire 
interval [0,1).  For the ensemble <VAR>AADB#</VAR>, the first <VAR>A</VAR> reduces the
interval to [0,.2) and the second <VAR>A</VAR> to [0,.04) (the first 1/5
of the previous interval).  The <VAR>D</VAR> further narrows the interval to
[.028,.036) (1/5 of the previous size, beginning 70% of the distance
from left to right).  The <VAR>B</VAR> narrows the interval to [.0296,.0328), 
and the <VAR>#</VAR> yields a final interval of [.03248,.0328).  The interval,
or alternatively any number <VAR>i</VAR> within the interval, may now be used to
represent the source ensemble.

Figure 3.9 -- The Arithmetic coding model.

Two equations may be used to define the narrowing process described above: <BR>
<PRE>
   newleft = prevleft + msgleft*prevsize      (1)
   newsize = prevsize * msgsize               (2)
</PRE>

The first equation states that the left endpoint of the new interval is
calculated from the previous interval and the current source message.
The left endpoint of the range associated with the current message
specifies what percent of the previous interval to remove from the left
in order to form the new interval.  For <VAR>D</VAR> in the above example, the new left
endpoint is moved over by .7 * .04 (70% of the size of the previous
interval).  The second equation computes the
size of the new interval from the previous interval size and the probability
of the current message (which is equivalent to the size of its associated
range).  Thus, the size of the interval determined by <VAR>D</VAR> is .04*.2, and the
right endpoint is .028+.008=.036 (left endpoint + size).
<P>
The size of the final subinterval determines the number of bits needed to
specify a number in that range.  The number of bits needed to specify a
subinterval of [0,1) of size <VAR>s</VAR> is -lg <VAR>s</VAR>.  Since the size of the final
subinterval is the product of the probabilities of the source messages
in the ensemble (that is, <VAR>s</VAR>=PROD{<VAR>i</VAR>=1 to <VAR>N</VAR>} <VAR>p</VAR>(source message <VAR>i</VAR>) where 
<VAR>N</VAR> is the length of the ensemble), we have 
-lg <VAR>s</VAR> = -SUM{<VAR>i</VAR>=1 to <VAR>N</VAR> lg <VAR>p</VAR>(source message <VAR>i</VAR>) =
- SUM{<VAR>i</VAR>=1 to <VAR>n</VAR>} <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>)) lg <VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>)), where <VAR>n</VAR> is the number of unique
source messages <VAR>a</VAR>(1), <VAR>a</VAR>(2), ... <VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>).
Thus, the number of bits generated
by the arithmetic coding technique is exactly equal to entropy, <VAR>H</VAR>.
This demonstrates the fact that arithmetic coding achieves compression
which is almost exactly that predicted by the entropy of the source.
<P>
In order to recover the original ensemble, the decoder must
know the model of the source used by the encoder (eg., the source messages
and associated ranges) and a single number within the interval determined
by the encoder.  Decoding consists of a series of comparisons of the number
<VAR>i</VAR> to the ranges representing the source messages.  For this example,
<VAR>i</VAR> might be .0325 (.03248, .0326, or .0327 would all do just as well).
The decoder uses <VAR>i</VAR> to simulate the actions of the encoder.  Since <VAR>i</VAR> lies 
between 0 and .2, he deduces that the first letter was <VAR>A</VAR> (since the range
[0,.2) corresponds to source message <VAR>A</VAR>).  This narrows the interval
to [0,.2).  The decoder can now deduce that the next message will further
narrow the interval in one of the following ways:  to [0,.04) for <VAR>A</VAR>,
to [.04,.12) for <VAR>B</VAR>, to [.12,.14) for <VAR>C</VAR>, to [.14,.18) for <VAR>D</VAR>,
and to [.18,.2) for <VAR>#</VAR>.  Since <VAR>i</VAR> falls into the interval [0,.04),
he knows that the second message is again <VAR>A</VAR>.  This process continues until
the entire ensemble has been recovered.
<P>
Several difficulties become evident when implementation of arithmetic coding
is attempted.  The first is that the decoder needs some way of knowing
when to stop.  As evidence of this, the number 0 could represent any of
the source ensembles <VAR>A, AA, AAA,</VAR> etc.  Two solutions to this problem
have been suggested.  One is that the encoder transmit the size of the
ensemble as part of the description of the model.  Another is that
a special symbol be included in the model for the purpose of signaling
end of message.  The <VAR>#</VAR> in the above example serves this purpose.
The second alternative is preferable for several reasons.  First, sending
the size of the ensemble requires a two-pass process and precludes the use
of arithmetic coding as part of a hybrid codebook scheme (see
<a href="DC-Sec1.html#Sec_1.2">Sections 1.2</a> and <a href="#Sec_3.2">3.2</a>).
Secondly, adaptive methods of arithmetic coding are easily
developed and a first pass to determine ensemble size is inappropriate in
an on-line adaptive scheme.
<P>
A second issue left unresolved by the fundamental concept of arithmetic
coding is that of incremental transmission and reception.  It appears
from the above discussion that the encoding algorithm transmits nothing
until the final interval is determined.  However, this delay is not
necessary.  As the interval narrows, the leading bits  of the left
and right endpoints become the same.  Any leading bits that are the same may be
transmitted immediately, as they will not be affected by further narrowing.
A third issue is that of precision.  From the description of arithmetic
coding it appears that the precision required grows without bound as the
length of the ensemble grows.  Witten et al. and Rubin address this issue
[Witten et al. 1987; Rubin 1979].  Fixed precision registers may be used
as long as underflow and overflow are detected and managed.  The degree
of compression achieved by an implementation of arithmetic coding is
not exactly <VAR>H</VAR>, as implied by the concept of arithmetic coding.  Both the use
of a message terminator and the use of fixed-length arithmetic reduce
coding effectiveness.  However, it is clear that an end-of-message symbol
will not have a significant effect on a large source ensemble.
Witten et al. approximate the overhead due to the use of fixed
precision at 10^-4 bits per source message, which is also negligible.
<P>
The arithmetic coding model for ensemble <VAR>EXAMPLE</VAR> is given in
Figure 3.10.  The final interval size is
<VAR>p</VAR>(a)^2*<VAR>p</VAR>(b)^3*<VAR>p</VAR>(c)^4*<VAR>p</VAR>(d)^5*<VAR>p</VAR>(e)^6*<VAR>p</VAR>(f)^7*<VAR>p</VAR>(g)^8*<VAR>p</VAR>(<VAR>space</VAR>)^5.
The number of bits needed to specify a value in the interval 
is -lg(1.44*10^-35)=115.7.  So excluding overhead, arithmetic coding
transmits <VAR>EXAMPLE</VAR> in 116 bits, one less bit than static Huffman coding.

</PRE>

Witten et al. provide an implementation of arithmetic coding, written in C,
which separates the model of the source from the coding process (where the
coding process is defined by Equations 3.1 and 3.2) [Witten et al. 1987].
The model is in a separate program module and is consulted by the encoder
and by the decoder at every step in the processing.  The fact that the
model can be separated so easily renders the classification static/adaptive
irrelevent for this technique.  Indeed, the fact that the coding method
provides compression efficiency nearly equal to the entropy of the source
under any model allows arithmetic coding to be coupled with any static or
adaptive method for computing the probabilities (or frequencies) of the
source messages.  Witten et al. implement an adaptive model similar to the
techniques described in <a href="DC-Sec4.html#Sec_4">Section 4</a>.  The performance
of this implementation is discussed in <a href="DC-Sec678.html#Sec_6">Section 6</a>.
