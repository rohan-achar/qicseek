<b>Introduction: To Classify Is Human</b>
<p>Our lives are henged round with systems of classification, limned by
standard formats, prescriptions, and objects. Enter a modern home and you
are surrounded by standards and categories spanning the color of paint
on the walls and in the fabric of the furniture, the types of wires strung
to appliances, the codes in the building permits allowing the kitchen sink
to be properly plumbed and the walls to be adequately fireproofed. Ignore
these forms at your peril � as a building owner, be sued by irate tenants;
as an inspector, risk malpractice suits denying your proper application
of the ideal to the case at hand; as a parent, risk toxic paint threatening
your children.
<p>To classify is human. Not all classifications take formal shape or are
standardized in commercial and bureaucratic products. We all spend large
parts of our days doing classification work, often tacitly, and make up
and use a range of <i>ad hoc</i> classifications in order to do so. We
sort dirty dishes from clean, white laundry from colorfast, important email
to be answered from e-junk. We match the size and type of our car tires
to the amount of pressure they should accept. Our desktops are a mute testimony
to a kind of muddled folk classification: papers which must read by yesterday,
<i>but
which have been there since last year</i>; old professional journals which
really should be read and even in fact may someday be, <i>and which have
been there since last year</i>; assorted grant applications, tax forms,
various work-related surveys and forms waiting to be filled out for everything
from parking spaces to immunizations. These surfaces may be piled with
sentimental cards which are already read <i>but which can�t yet be thrown
out</i> alongside reminder notes to send similar cards to parents, sweethearts,
or to friends for their birthdays, all piled on top of last year�s calendar
(which who knows, may be useful at tax time). Any part of the home, school
or workplace reveals some such system of classification: medications classed
as not for children occupy a higher shelf than safer ones; books for reference
are shelved close to where we do the Sunday crossword puzzle; door keys
are color-coded and stored according to frequency of use.
<p>What sorts of things order these piles, locations, and implicit labels?
We have certain knowledge of these intimate spaces, classifications that
seem to live partly in our hands � definitely not just in the head or in
any formal algorithm. The knowledge about which thing will be useful at
any given moment is embodied in a flow of mundane tasks and practices and
many varied social roles (child, boss, friend, employee). When we need
to put our hands on something, it is there.
<p>Our computer desktops are no less cluttered. Here the electronic equivalent
of "not yet ready to throw out" is also well represented. A quick scan
of one of the author�s desktops reveals seven residual categories represented
in the various folders of email and papers: "fun" "take back to office"
"remember to look up" "misc." "misc. correspondence" "general web information"
"teaching stuff to do" and "to do." We doubt if this is an unusual degree
of disarray or an overly prolific use of the "none of the above" category
so common to standardized tests and surveys.
<p>These standards and classifications, however imbricated in our lives,
are ordinarily invisible. The formal, bureaucratic ones trail behind them
the entourage of permits, forms, numerals, and the sometimes-visible work
of people who adjust them to make organizations run smoothly. In that sense,
they may become more visible, especially when they break down, or become
objects of contention. But what <i>are </i>these categories? Who makes
them, and who may change them? When and why do they become visible? How
do they spread? What, for instance, is the relationship between locally
generated categories, tailored to the particular space of a bathroom cabinet,
and the commodified, elaborate, expensive ones generated by medical diagnoses,
government regulatory bodies, and pharmaceutical firms?
<p>Remarkably for such a central part of our lives, we stand for the most
part in formal ignorance of the social and moral order created by these
invisible, potent entities. Their impact is indisputable, and as Foucault
reminds us, inescapable. Try the simple experiment of ignoring your gender
classification and use instead whichever toilets are the nearest; try to
locate a library book shelved under the wrong Library of Congress catalogue
number; stand in the immigration queue at a busy foreign airport without
the right passport or arrive without the transformer and the adaptor that
translates between electrical standards. The material force of categories
appears always and instantly.
<p>At the level of public policy, classifications such as those of regions,
activities, and natural resources play an equally important role. Whether
or not a region is classified as ecologically important; whether another
is zoned industrial or residential come to bear significantly on future
economic decisions. The substrate of decision-making in this area, while
often hotly argued across political camps, is only intermittently visible.
Changing such categories, once designated, is usually a cumbersome, bureaucratically
fraught process.
<p>For all this importance, classifications and standards occupy a peculiar
place in studies of social order. Anthropologists have studied classification
as a device for understanding the cultures of others � categories such
as the raw and the cooked have been clues to the core organizing principles
for colonial Western understandings of "primitive" culture. Some economists
have looked at the effects of adopting a standard in those markets where
networks and compatibility are crucial. For example, videotape recorders,
refrigerators and personal computer software embody arguably inferior technical
standards, but standards that benefited from the timing of their historical
entry into the marketplace. Some historians have examined the explosion
of natural history and medical classifications in the late nineteenth century,
both as a political force and as an organizing rubric for complex bureaucracies.
A few sociologists have done detailed studies of individual categories
linked with social movements, such as the diagnosis of homosexuality as
an illness and its demedicalization in the wake of gay and lesbian civil
rights. Information scientists work every day on the design, delegation
and choice of classification systems and standards, yet few see them as
artifacts embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft people�s
identities, aspirations and dignity. Philosophers and statisticians have
produced highly formal discussions of classification theory, but few empirical
studies of use or impact.
<p>Both within and outside the academy, single categories or classes of
categories may also become objects of contention and study. The above-mentioned
demedicalization of the category homosexual in the American Psychiatric
Association�s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 3 (the DSM, a handbook
of psychiatric classification) followed direct and vigorous lobbying of
the APA by gay and lesbian advocates (Kirk and Kutchins, 1992). During
this same era, feminists were split on the subject of whether the categories
of premenstrual syndrome and post partum depression would be good or bad
for women as they became included in the DSM. Many feminist psychotherapists
were engaged in a bitter argument about whether to include these categories.
As Ann Figert (1996) relates, they even felt their own identities and professional
judgements to be on the line. (Allan Young (1995) makes the complicating
observation that psychiatrists increasingly use the language of the DSM
to communicate with each other and their accounting departments, although
they frequently don�t believe in the categories they are using).
<p>More recently, as discussed in Chapter 6, the option to choose multiple
racial categories was introduced as part of the US Government routine data
collection mission, following Statistical Directive 15 in October, 1997.
The Office of Management and Budget issued the directive, and conservatively,
its implementation will cost several million dollars. One direct consequence
is the addition of this option to the US Census, an addition that was fraught
with political passion. A march on Washington concerning the category took
the traditional ultimate avenue of mass protest for American activists.
The march was conducted by people who identified themselves as multi-racial,
and their families and advocates. At the same time, it was vigorously opposed
by many African-American and Hispanic civil rights groups (among several
others), who saw the option as a "whitewash" against which important ethnic
and policy-related distinctions would be lost (Robbin, 1998).
<p>However, despite the contentiousness of some categories, none of the
above-named disciplines or social movements has systematically addressed
the pragmatics of the invisible forces of categories and standards in the
modern built world, especially the modern information technology world.
Foucault�s (1970; 1982) work comes the closest to a thoroughgoing examination
in his arguments that an archaeological dig is necessary in order to find
the origins and consequences of a range of social categories and practices.
He focussed on the concept of order, and its implementation in categorical
discourse. The ubiquity described by Foucault appears as an iron cage of
bureaucratic discipline against a broad historical landscape. But there
is much more to be done, both empirically and theoretically. No one, including
Foucault, has systematically tackled the question of how these properties
inform social and moral order via the new technological and electronic
infrastructures. Few have looked at the creation and maintenance of complex
classifications as a kind of <i>work practice</i>, with its attendant financial,
skill and moral dimensions. These are the tasks of this book.
<p>We take Foucault�s practical archaeology as a point of departure for
examining several cases of classification, some of which have become formal
or standardized, and some of which have not. We have several concerns in
this exploration, growing both from the consideration of classification
work, and its attendant moral dimensions. First, we seek to understand
the role of invisibility in the work that classification does in ordering
human interaction. We want to understand how these categories are made
and kept invisible, and in some cases, we want to challenge the silences
surrounding them. In this sense, our job here is to find tools for seeing
the invisible, much as &Eacute;mile Durkheim passionately sought to convince
his audience of the material force of the social fact � to <i>see </i>that
society was not just an idea � over one hundred years ago (Durkheim, 1982).
<p>We also explore systems of classification as part of the built information
environment. Much as a city planner or urban historian would leaf back
through highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city�s story, we
delve the dusty archives of classification design in order better to understand
how wide-scale classification decisions have been made.
<p>We have a moral and ethical agenda in our querying of these systems.
Each standard and each category valorizes some point of view and silences
another. This is not inherently a bad thing � indeed it is inescapable.
But it <i>is</i> an ethical choice, and as such it is dangerous � not bad,
but dangerous. For example, the decision of the US Immigration and Naturalization
Service to classify some races and classes as desirable for US residents,
and others as not, resulted in a quota system which valued affluent people
from Northern and Western Europe over those (especially the poor) from
Africa or South America. The decision to classify students by their standardized
achievement and aptitude tests valorizes some kinds of knowledge skills
and renders other kinds invisible. Other types of decisions with serious
material force may not immediately appear as morally problematic. The collective
standardization in the United States on VHS videotapes over Betamax, for
instance, may seem ethically neutral. The classification and standardization
of types of seed for farming is not obviously fraught with moral weight.
But as Busch (1995) and Addelson (1994) argue, such long-term, collective
forms of choice are also morally fraught. We are used to viewing moral
choices as individual, as dilemmas, and as rational choices. We have an
impoverished vocabulary for collective moral passages, to use Addelson�s
terminology. For any individual, group or situation, classifications and
standards give advantage or they give suffering. Jobs are made and lost;
some regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made,
and how we may think about that invisible matching process is at the core
of the ethical project of this work.
<p><b>Working Infrastructures</b>
<p><i>Sorting Things Out</i> stands at the crossroads of sociology of knowledge
and technology, history and information science. The categories represented
on our desktops and in our medicine cabinets are fairly ad hoc and individual,
not even legitimate anthropological folk or ethno classifications. They
are not often investigated by information scientists (but see Kwasnik,
1988, 1991; Beghtol, 1995; Star, 1998). But everyone uses and creates them
in some form, and they are (increasingly) important in organizing computer-based
work. They often have old and deep historical roots. True, Personal Information
Managers are designed precisely to make this process transparent, but even
with their aid, the problem continues: we still must design or select categories,
still enter data, still struggle with things that don�t fit. At the same
time, we rub these <i>ad hoc</i> classifications against an increasingly
elaborate large-scale system of formal categories and standards. Users
of the Internet alone navigate, now fairly seamlessly, more than two hundred
formally elected Internet standards for information transmission each time
we send an email message. If we are to understand larger-scale classifications,
we also need to understand how desktop classifications link up with those
that are formal, standardized, and widespread.
<p>Every link in hypertext creates a category. That is, it reflects some
judgment about two or more objects: they are the same, or alike, or functionally
linked, or linked as part of an unfolding series. The rummage sale of information
on the World Wide Web is overwhelming, and we all agree that finding information
is much less of a problem than assessing its quality -- the nature of its
categorical associations, and by whom they are made (Bates, in press).
The historical cultural model of social classification research in this
book, from desktop to wide-scale infrastructure, is a good one through
which to view problems of indexing, tracking, and even compiling bibliographies
on the web. In its cultural and workplace dimensions, it offers insights
into the problematics of design of classification systems, and a lens for
examining their impact. It looks at these processes as a sort of crafting
of treaties. In this, a cross-disciplinary approach is crucial. Any information
systems design that neglects use and user semantics is bound for trouble
down the line � it will become either oppressive or irrelevant. Information
systems mix up the conventional and the formal, the hard technical problems
of storage and retrieval with the hard interactional problems of querying
and organizing.
<p>Information systems are undergoing rapid change. There is an explosion
of information on the World Wide Web and associated technologies, and fast
moving changes in how information may converge across previously disparate
families of technology � for instance, using one�s television to retrieve
email and browse the web, using one�s Internet connections to make telephone
calls. Whatever we write here about the latest electronic developments
will be outdated by the time this book sees print, a medium many would
argue is itself anachronistic.
<p>Conventions of use, and understandings of the impact of these changes
on social organization are slower to come. The following example illustrates
the intermingling of the conventional and the local in the types of classificatory
links formed by hypertext. A few years ago, our university was in the enviable
position of having several job openings in Library and Information Science.
Both the authors were on the search committee. During the process of sifting
through applications and finding out more about candidates, the need arose
to query something on the candidate�s resume. We used the Alta Vista search
engine to find the candidate�s email address. (Of course, the first thing
one really does with Alta Vista is egosurfing - checking one�s own name
to see how many times it appears on the web - but we had already done that.)
His email address and formal institutional home page appeared in about
15 seconds on our desktop -- but so did his contributions to a discussion
on world peace, a feminist bulletin board, and one of the more arcane alt.rec
Usenet groups. We found ourselves unable to stop our eyes from roving through
the quoted Usenet posts � category boundaries surely never meant to be
crossed by a job search committee. Fortunately for us as committee members,
we interpreted what we found on the web as evidence that the applicant
was a more well rounded person than his formal CV had conveyed. He became
a more interesting candidate.
<p>But of course, it might have gone badly for him. In less than a minute
we had accessed information about him that crossed a social boundary of
<i>de
facto</i> privacy, access, and awareness context (Glaser and Strauss, 1965).
The risk of random readership had been there in some sense when he posted
to a public space -- but who on a search committee in the old days of a
couple of years ago could possibly be bothered searching ftp archives?
Who would have time? There are many ethical and etiquette-related questions
here, of course, with the right to privacy not least among them. The incident
also points to the fact that as a culture we have not yet developed conventions
of classification for the web that bear much moral or habitual conviction
in daily practice. The label alt.rec does not yet have the reflex power
that the label private does on a desk drawer or notebook cover. We would
never open someone�s desk drawer or diary. We are not normally known to
be a rude people -- but we haven�t yet developed or absorbed routine similar
politeness for things such as powerful web search engines. We were thus
somewhat embarrassed and confused about the morality of mentioning the
alt.rec postings to the committee.
<p>As we evolve the classifications of habit -- grow common fingertips
with respect to linkages and networks -- we will be faced with some choices.
How standardized will our indexes become? What forms of freedom of association
(between people, between texts and people, between texts) do we want to
preserve, and which are no longer useful? Who will decide these matters?
<p><b>Investigating Infrastructure</b>
<p>People do many things today that a few hundred years ago would have
looked like magic. We all know versions of this banal assertion - we�ve
probably all made it in one form or another or ourselves at some point.
And if we don�t understand a given technology it looks like magic: for
example, we are perpetually surprised by the mellifluous tones read off
our favorite CDs by, we believe, a laser. Most of us have no notion of
the decades of negotiation that inform agreement on, inter alia, standard
disc size, speed, electronic setting, and amplification standards. It is
not dissimilar to the experience of magic one enjoys at a fine restaurant
or an absorbing play. A common description of a good waiter or butler (one
thinks of Jeeves in the Wodehouse stories) is that she clears a table and
smoothes the unfolding of events �as if by magic.� In a compelling play,
the hours of rehearsal and missteps are disappeared from center stage,
behind a seamless front stage presentation. Is the magic of the CD different
from the magic of the waiter or the theater ensemble? Are these two kinds
of magic or one -- or none?
<p>This book is an attempt to answer this question, which can be posed
more prosaically as:
<ul>
<li>
What work do classifications and standards do? Again, we want to look at
what goes into making things work like magic: making them fit together
so that we can buy a radio built by someone we have never met in Japan,
plug it into a wall in Champaign, Illinois and hear the world news from
the BBC.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Who does that work? We explore the fact that all this magic involves much
work: there is a lot of hard labor in effortless ease. Such invisible work
is often not only underpaid - it is severely underrepresented in theoretical
literature (Star and Strauss, 1999). We will discuss where all the �missing
work� that makes things look magical goes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
What happens to the cases that don�t fit? We want to draw attention to
cases that don�t fit easily into our magical created world of standards
and classifications: the left handers in the world of right-handed magic,
chronic disease sufferers in the acute world of allopathic medicine, the
vegetarian in MacDonald�s (Star, 1991b) and so forth.</li>
</ul>
These are issues of great import. It is easy to get lost in Baudrillard�s
(1990) cool memories of simulacra. He argues that it is impossible to sort
out media representations from �what really happens.� We are unable to
stand outside representation or separate simulations from nature. At the
same time, he pays no attention to the work of constructing the simulations,
or the infrastructural considerations that underwrite the images/events
(and we agree that separating them ontologically is a hopeless task). The
hype of our postmodern times is that we don�t need to think about this
sort of <i>work</i> any more. The real issues are scientific and technological,
stripped of the conditions of production - in artificial life, thinking
machines, nanotechnology, and genetic manipulation.... Clearly each of
these <i>is</i> important. But there is more at stake - epistemologically,
politically and ethically - in the day to day work of building classification
systems and producing and maintaining standards than in abstract arguments
about representation. Their pyrotechnics may hold our fascinated gaze;
they cannot provide any path to answering our moral questions.

<p><font color="#3333FF">I grew up in Rhode Island, a New England state
which is largely Italian-American and French-Canadian, known chiefly for
its small stature. When I was a kid in our neighborhood, the first thing
you would ask on encountering a newcomer was "what�s your name?" The second
was "what are you?" "What are you" was an invitation to recite your ethnic
composition in a kind of singsong voice. 90% of the kids would say "Italian
with a little bit of French," or "half-Portuguese, one-quarter Italian
and one-quarter Armenian." When I would chime in with "half Jewish, one
quarter Scottish and one quarter English," the range of responses went
from very puzzled looks to "does that mean you�re not Catholic?" Wherein,
I guess, began my fascination with classification, and especially with
the problem of residual categories, or, the Other, or not elsewhere classified.</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Two Definitions</i> : Classification and Standards</b>
<p>Up to this point, we have been using the terms classification and standardization
without formal definition. Let us clarify the terms now.
<p><b>Classification</b>
<p><i>A classification is a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal segmentation
of the world.</i> A �classification system� is a set of boxes (metaphorical
or literal) into which things can be put in order to then do some kind
of work - bureaucratic or knowledge production. In an abstract, ideal sense,
a classification system exhibits the following properties:
<ol>
<li>
<i>There are consistent, unique classificatory principles in operation</i>.
One common sort of system here is the <i>genetic</i> principle of ordering.
This refers not to DNA analysis, but an older and simpler sense of the
word: classifying things by their origin and descent (Tort, 1989). A genealogical
map of a family�s history of marriage, birth and death is genetic in this
sense (even for adopted children and in-laws). So is a flow chart showing
a hierarchy of tasks deriving from one another over time. There are many
other types of classificatory principles � sorting correspondence by date
received (temporal order), for example, or recipes by those most frequently
used (functional order).</li>

<li>
<i>The categories are mutually exclusive</i>. In an ideal world, categories
are clearly demarcated bins, into which any object addressed by the system
will neatly and uniquely fit. So in the family genealogy, one mother and
one father give birth to a child, forever and uniquely attributed to them
as parents - there are no surrogate mothers, or issues of shared custody
or of retrospective DNA testing. A rose is a rose, not a rose sometimes
and a daisy other times.</li>

<li>
<i>The system is complete</i>. With respect to the items, actions or areas
under its consideration, the ideal classification system provides total
coverage of the world it describes. So, for example, a botanical classifier
would not simply ignore a newly discovered plant, but would always strive
to name it. A physician using a diagnostic classification must enter <i>something
</i>in
the patient�s record where a category is called for; where unknown, the
possibility exists of a medical discovery, to be absorbed into the complete
system of classifying.</li>
</ol>
No real-world working classification system that we have looked at meets
these �simple� requirements and we doubt that any ever could. In the case
of unique classificatory systems, people disagree about their nature; they
ignore or misunderstand them; or they routinely mix together different
and contradictory principles. A library, for example, may have a consistent
Library of Congress system in place, but supplement it in an <i>ad hoc</i>
way. Best sellers to be rented out to patrons may find themselves on a
separate shelf; very rare, pornographic or expensive books may be locked
away from general viewing at the discretion of the local librarian. Thus,
the books are moved, without being formally reclassified, yet carry an
additional functional system in their physical placement.
<p>For the second point, mutual exclusivity may be impossible in practice,
as when there is disagreement or ambivalence about the membership of an
object in a category. Medicine is replete with such examples, especially
when the disease entity is controversial or socially stigmatized. In terms
of the third point, completeness, there may be good reasons to ignore data
that would make a system more comprehensive. The discovery of a new species
on an economically important development site may be silenced for monetary
considerations. An anomaly may be acknowledged, but be too expensive �
politically or bureaucratically -- to introduce into a system of record
keeping. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate ways of reading classification systems
so as to be simultaneously sensitive to these conceptual, organizational
and political dimensions.
<p>Consider the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which will
be one of our major examples throughout this book. The full title of the
current (10th) edition of the ICD, is: "ICD-10 - International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems; Tenth Revision."
Note that it is designated a �statistical� classification. By this is meant
that only diseases which are statistically significant are to be entered
in (it is not an attempt to classify all disease).
<p>The ICD calls itself a �classification,� even though many have said
that it is a �nomenclature� since it has no single classificatory principle
(it has at least four; which are not mutually exclusive (this point is
developed in Chapter 4)). A nomenclature simply means an agreed-upon naming
scheme, and need not follow any classificatory principles. The nomenclature
of streets in Paris, for example, includes those named after intellectual
figures, plants and trees, battles, and politicians, as well as those inherited
from former governments, such as Rue de Lut&egrave;ce (Lut&egrave;ce was
the ancient Roman name for Paris). There is no classificatory system. Nomenclature
and classification are frequently confused, however, since often attempts
are made to model nomenclature on a single, stable system of classification
principles - as for example with botany (Bowker, in press) or anatomy.
In the case of the ICD, diagnostic nomenclature and the terms in the ICD
itself were conflated in the American system of diagnosis-related groups
(DRGs), much to the dismay of some medical researchers. In many cases the
ICD represents a compromise between conflicting schemes:
<dir>
<dir>The terms used in categories C82-C85 for non-Hodgkin�s lymphomas are
those of the Working Formulation, which attempted to find common ground
among several major classification systems. The terms used in these schemes
are not given in the Tabular List but appear in the Alphabetical Index;
exact equivalence with the terms appearing in the Tabular List is not always
possible. (ICD-10, 1: 215).</dir>
</dir>
However, the ICD presents itself clearly as a classification scheme and
not a nomenclature. Since 1970, there has been an effort underway by the
World Health Organization to build a distinct International Nomenclature
of Diseases (IND), whose main purpose will be to provide: "a single recommended
name for every disease entity" (ICD-10, 1: 25).
<p>For the purposes of this book, we take a broad enough definition so
that anything that is consistently called a classification system <i>and
treated as such </i>can be included in the term. This is a classic Pragmatist
turn � things perceived as real are real in their consequences (Thomas
and Thomas, 1917). If we took a purist or formalist view, the ICD would
be a (somewhat confused) nomenclature and who knows what the IND would
represent. With a broad, Pragmatic definition we can look at the work that
is involved in building and maintaining a family of entities that people
call classification systems - rather than attempt the Herculean, Sisyphian
task of purifying the (un)stable systems in place. Howard Becker makes
a cognate point here:
<dir>
<dir>Epistemology has been a ... negative discipline, mostly devoted to
saying what you shouldn�t do if you want your activity to merit the title
of science, and to keeping unworthy pretenders from successfully appropriating
it. The sociology of science, the empirical descendant of epistemology,
gives up trying to decide what should and shouldn�t count as science, and
tells what people who claim to be doing science do.<sup> </sup>(Becker,
1996: 54-55).</dir>
</dir>
The work of making, maintaining, and analyzing classification systems is
richly textured. It is one of the central kinds of work of modernity, including
science and medicine. It is, we argue, central to social life.
<p><b>Standards</b>
<p>Classifications and standards are closely related, but not identical.
While this book focuses on classification, standards are crucial components
of the larger argument. The systems we discuss often do become standardized;
in addition, a standard is in part a way of classifying the world. What
then are standards? The term as we use it in the book has several dimensions:
<ol>
<li>
A �standard� is any set of agreed-upon rules for the production of (textual
or material) objects.</li>

<li>
A standard spans more than one community of practice (or site of activity).
It has temporal reach as well, in that it persists over time.</li>

<li>
Standards are deployed in making things work together over distance and
heterogeneous metrics. For example, computer protocols for Internet communication
involve a cascade of standards (cf. Abbate and Kahin, 1995) which need
to work together well in order for the average user to gain seamless access
to the web of information. There are standards for the components to link
from your computer to the phone network, for coding and decoding binary
streams as sound, for sending messages from one network to another, for
attaching documents to messages, and so forth.</li>

<li>
Legal bodies often enforce standards - be these professional organizations,
manufacturers� organizations or the State. We might say tomorrow that volap&uuml;k
(a universal language that boasted some 23 journals in 1889<sup> </sup>(Proust,
1989: 580)) or its successor Esperanto shall henceforth be the standard
language for international diplomacy. Without a mechanism of enforcement,
or a grassroots movement, we shall fail.</li>

<li>
There is no natural law that the best standard shall win - QWERTY, Lotus
123, DOS and VHS are often cited in this context. The standards that do
win may do so for a variety of other reasons: they build on an installed
base, they had better marketing at the outset, and they were used by a
community of gatekeepers who favored their use. Sometimes standards win
due to an outright conspiracy, as in the case of the gas refrigerator documented
by Cowan (1985).</li>

<li>
Standards have significant inertia, and can be very difficult and expensive
to change.</li>
</ol>
It was possible to build a cathedral like Chartres without standard representations
(blueprints) and standard building materials (regular sizes for stones,
tools etc.) (Turnbull, 1993). People invented an amazing array of analog
measuring devices (such as string lengths). Each cathedral town posted
the local analog metric (a length of metal) at its gates, so that peripatetic
master builders could calibrate their work to it when they arrived in the
town. They did not have a wide-scale measurement system such as our modern
metric or decimal systems. (Whether as a result of this local improvisation
or not, Turnbull notes, many cathedrals did fall down!)
<p>It is no longer possible to build a complex collective project without
standardized measurements. Consider a modern housing development; too much
needs to come together from distant and proximate sources - electricity,
gas, sewer, timber sizes, screws, nails and so on. The control of standards
is a central, often underanalyzed feature of economic life (but see the
work of Paul David - for example David and Rothwell, 1994 - for a rich
treatment). They are key to knowledge production as well - Latour (1987)
speculates that far more economic resources are spent creating and maintaining
standards than in producing �pure� science. There are a number of histories
of standards which point to the development and maintenance of standards
as being critical to industrial production.
<p>At the same time, just as with classifications, these dimensions of
standards are in some sense idealized. They embody goals of practice and
production that are never perfectly realized � like Plato�s triangles.
The process of building to a standardized code, for example, usually includes
a face-to-face negotiation between builder(s) and inspector(s), which itself
includes a history of relations between those people. Small deviations
are routinely overlooked, unless the inspector is making a political point.
The idiom "good enough for government use" embodies the common sense accommodations
of the slip between the ideal standard and the contingencies of practice.
<p>In this and in many other ways, then, classifications and standards
are two sides of the same coin. Classifications may or may not become standardized.
If they do not, they are <i>ad hoc</i>, limited to an individual or a local
community, and/or of limited duration. At the same time, every successful
standard imposes a classification system, at the very least between good
and bad ways of organizing actions or things. And the workarounds involved
in the practical use of standards frequently entail the use of ad hoc non-standard
categories. For example, a patient may respond to a standardized protocol
for the management of chronic back pain by approximating the directions
and supplementing them with an idiosyncratic or alternative medical classification
scheme. If the protocol requires a number of exercises done three times
a day, the patient may distinguish good days from bad days, vacation days
from working days, and only do the exercises when they deem them necessary.
<p>Classifications and standards are related in another sense, which concerns
the use of a classification by more than one social world or community
of practice, and the impact that use has on questions of membership and
the taken-for-grantedness of objects. Throughout this book, we speak of
classifications as objects for cooperation across social worlds, or as
boundary objects (Star and Griesemer, 1989). Drawing from earlier studies
of interdisciplinary scientific cooperation, we define boundary objects
as those objects that both inhabit several communities of practice <u>and</u>
satisfy the informational requirements of each of them. In working practice,
they are objects that are able both to travel across borders and maintain
some sort of constant identity. They can be tailored to meet the needs
of any one community (they are plastic in this sense, or customizable).
At the same time, they have common identities across settings. This is
achieved by allowing the objects to be weakly structured in common use,
imposing stronger structures in the individual-site tailored use. They
are thus both ambiguous and constant; they may be abstract or concrete.
In Chapter 9, we explore in detail the abstract ramifications of the use
of classifications by more than one community and the connection with the
emergence of standards.
<p><b>The Structure of this Book</b>
<p>In order to explore these questions, we have written a first chapter
detailing some key themes of the work to follow. We have then divided the
middle of the book into three parts, which look at several classification
systems. We have structured these studies around three issues in turn:
classification and large-scale infrastructures (Part 1); classification
and biography (Part 2) and classification and work practice (Part 3). Weaving
these three themes in combination, we can explore the texture of the space
within which infrastructures work and classification systems from different
worlds meet, adjust, fracture or merge. In two concluding chapters, we
elaborate some theoretical conclusions from these studies.
<p><u>Part 1: Classification and Large-Scale Infrastructures</u>
<p>Classification systems are integral to any working infrastructure. In
Part 1 (Chapters 2-4) we examine how a global medical classification system
was developed to serve the conflicting needs of multiple local, national
and international information systems.
<p>Our investigation here begins in the late nineteenth century, with another
kind of information explosion � the development of myriad systems of classification
and standardization of modern industrial and scientific institutions.
<p>In the nineteenth century people learned to look at themselves as surrounded
by tiny, invisible things which have the power of life or death: microbes
and bacteria. They learned to teach their children to wash their hands
of germs before eating, and later, to apply antiseptic salve to a cat scratch
or an inflamed fingernail. Company washrooms sprouted signs admonishing
employees to wash hands before returning to work, especially if they worked
with food served to others. In this period, people also learned how to
perform surgery that would not usually be fatal and how to link gum disease
with bacteria between the teeth.
<p>At the same time as they learned these practices with respect to germs,
another ubiquitous set of tiny, invisible things were being negotiated
and sewn into the social fabric. These were formal, commodified classifications
and standards, both scientific and commercial. People classified, measured
and standardized just about everything -- animals, human races, books,
pharmaceutical products, taxes, jobs, and diseases. The categories so produced
lived in industry, medicine, science, education and government. They ranged
from the measurement of machine tools to the measurement of people�s forearms
and foreheads. The standards were sometimes physically tiny measures --
how big should be a standard size second of time, or an eyeglass screw
or an electrical pulse rate? At other times, they were larger: what size
should a railroad car be, or a city street � or a corporation? Government
agencies, industrial consortia, and scientific committees created the standards
and category systems. So did mail order firms, machine tool manufacturers,
and animal breeders, and thousands of other actors. Most of these activities
became silently embodied in the built environment and in notions of good
practice. The decisions taken in the course of their construction are forever
lost to the historical record. In fact, their history is considered by
most to be boring, trivial, and unworthy of investigation.
<p>There are some striking similarities to our own late 20<sup>th</sup>
century historical moment in that faced by Europeans at the end of the
19<sup>th</sup> century. A new international information-sharing and gathering
movement was starting, thanks to the advent of wide-scale international
travel, international quasi-governmental governance structures, and a growing
awareness that many phenomena (like epidemics and markets) would not be
confined to one country. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, people faced for
the first time large numbers of bodies and their microbes moving rapidly
across national borders and between large bureaucracies -- and at an unprecedented
rate. Especially in the case of epidemics, international public health
became an urgent necessity. Attempts to control these passengers represent
one of the first large-scale Western medical classification schemes: ships
who had called at ports on the way back from Mecca had to follow a period
of quarantine during which anyone infected would become symptomatic --
thus emulating the slower timeline of horse or camel travel.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>After quarantine, one was given a �clean bill of health� and allowed
freedom of transport. This was a costly delay for the ships. And so, of
course, a black market in clean bills of health appeared shortly thereafter
... . The problem of tracking who was dying of what, where on earth became
a permanent feature of international bureaucracy.

<p>Constructing such a list may seem to us like a comparatively straightforward
task, once the mechanisms for reporting were in place. However, for over
one hundred years there has <i>never been consensus</i> about disease categories
or about the process of collecting data. So one culture sees spirit possession
as a valid cause of death, another ridicules this as superstition; one
medical specialty sees cancer as a localized phenomenon to be cut out and
stopped from spreading, another sees it as a disorder of the whole immune
system which merely manifests in one location or another. The implications
for both treatment and classification differ. Trying to encode both causes
results in serious information retrieval problems.
<p>In addition, classifications shift historically. In Britain in 1650
we find that 696 people died of being �aged�; 31 succumbed to wolves 9
to grief and 19 to �King�s Evil�. "Mother" claimed 2 in 1647 but none in
1650, but in that year 2 were �smothered and stifled.� Seven starved in
1650 (Graunt, 1662), but by 1930 the World Health Organization would make
a distinction: if an adult starved to death it was a misfortune; if a child
starved, it was homicide. Death by wolf alone becomes impossible by 1948,
where death from animals is divided between venomous and non-venomous,
and only dogs and rats are singled out for categories of their own (ICD
5, 1948, p. 267).

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The first part of this book is dedicated to understanding the construction
of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD): a classification
scheme with its origins in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century but still present
today � indeed it is ubiquitous in medical bureaucracy and medical information
systems. The ICD constitutes an impressive attempt to coordinate information
and resources about mortality and morbidity globally. For the background
research for understanding international processes of classification, we
went to Geneva and studied the archives of the World Health Organization
and its predecessors such as the League of Nations and the Office Internationale
d�Hygi&egrave;ne Publique. Roughly every ten years since the 1890s, the
ICD has been revised. The UN and the WHO have kept some records of the
process of revision; others are to be found in the file cabinets of individuals
involved in the revision process.
<p>What we found was not a record of gradually increasing consensus, but
a panoply of tangled and crisscrossing classification schemes, held together
by an increasingly harassed and sprawling international public health bureaucracy.
Spirit possession and superstition never do reconcile, but in order that
some data be entered on the Western-oriented death certificate, it becomes
possible from the WHO point of view for a death to be assigned the category
�non-existent disease�.
<p>One of the other major influences on keeping medical records has been
insurance companies, as we discuss in Chapter 4. As the working lives of
individuals became more closely tied up with the state and its occupational
health concerns, the classification of work-related diseases (including
industrial accidents) became very important. Life expectancy measures were
equally important, both in terms of estimating the available labor force
and for basic planning measures. Of course, occupational and non-work related
medical classifications did not always line up: companies might have been
reluctant to take responsibility for unsafe working conditions, latency
in conditions such as asbestosis makes data hard to come by; there may
have been moral conflicts about the cause of such illnesses.
<p>In similar fashion, any classification that touched on religious or
ethical questions (and surprisingly many do so) would be disputed. If life
begins at the moment of conception, abortion is murder and a fetus dead
at 3 months is a stillbirth, encoded as a live infant death. Contemporary
abortion wars in the U.S. and Western Europe attest to the enduring and
irreconcilable ontologies involved in these codifications.
<p>For a bureaucracy to establish a smooth data collection effort, a means
must be found to detour around such higher-order issues. The statistical
committee discussed in Chapter 4, assigned with determining the exact moment
of the beginning of life by number of attempted breaths and weight of fetus
or infant, cuts a Solomon-like figure against such a disputed landscape.
At the same time, there is an element of reductionist absurdity here �
how many breaths equals �life�? If not specified, another source of quality
control for data is lost; if specified, it seems to make common sense ironic.
This is an issue we will revisit as well in the discussion of nursing interventions,
Chapter 7.
<p>Algorithms for codification do not resolve the moral questions involved,
although they may obscure them. For decades, priests, feminists and medical
ethicists on both sides have debated the question of when a human life
begins. The moral questions involved in encoding such information � and
the politics of certainty and of voice involved � are much more obscure.
<p>Forms like the death certificate, when aggregated, form a case of what
Kirk and Kutchins call "the substitution of precision for validity" (1992;
see also Star, 1989b). That is, when a seemingly neutral data collection
mechanism is substituted for ethical conflict about the contents of the
forms, the moral debate is partially erased. One may get ever more precise
knowledge, without having resolved deeper questions, and indeed, by burying
them.
<p>There is no simple pluralistic answer to how such questions may be resolved
democratically or with due process. Making all knowledge retrievable, and
thus re-debatable, is an appealing solution in a sense from a purely information
scientific point of view. However, from a practical organizational viewpoint
this fails. For example, in 1927, a manual describing simultaneous causes
of death listed some 8,300 terms, which represented 34 million possible
combinations that might appear on the face of a death certificate. A complete
user manual for filling out the certificate would involve 61 volumes of
1,000 pages each. This is clearly not a pragmatic choice for conducting
a task which most physicians also find boring, low-status, and clinically
unimportant.
<p>As we know from studies of work of all sorts, people do not do the ideal
job, but the doable job. When faced with too many alternatives and too
much information, they satisfice (March and Simon, 1958). As an indicator
of this, studies of the validity of codes on death certificates repeatedly
show that doctors have favorite categories; these are regionally biased;
and autopsies (which are rarely done anyway) have a low rate of agreement
with the code on the form (Fagot-Largeault, 1989).
<p>Even when there is relatively simple consensus about the cause of death,
the act of assigning a classification can be socially or ethically charged.
Thus, in some countries the death certificate has two faces: a public certificate
which is handed to the funeral director in order that arrangements be made
quickly and discreetly, and a statistical cause which is filed anonymously
with the public health department. In this case, the doctor is not faced
with telling the family of a socially unacceptable form of death: syphilis
can become heart failure, or suicide can become a stroke. For example,
as we discuss in Chapter 4, the process of moving to an anonymous statistical
record may reveal hidden biases in the reporting of death. Where the death
certificate is public, stigma and the desire to protect the feelings of
the family may reign over scientific accuracy.
<p>Over the years, those designing the list of causes of death and disease
have struggled with all of these problems. One of the simple but important
rules of thumb to try to control for this degree of uncertainty is to distribute
the residual categories. "Not elsewhere classified" appears throughout
the entire ICD, but nowhere as a top-level category. So since uncertainty
is inevitable, and its scope and scale essentially unknowable, at least
its impact will not hit a single disease or location disproportionately.
Its effects will remain as local as possible; the quest for certainty is
not lost, but postponed, diluted, and abridged.
<p>With the rise of very-large scale information systems, the Internet,
the World Wide Web, and digital libraries, we find that the sorts of uncertainties
faced by the WHO are themselves endemic in our own lives. When we use email
filters, for example, we risk losing the information that doesn�t fit the
sender�s category: junk email is very hard to sort out automatically in
a reliable way. If we have too many detailed filters, we lose the efficiency
sought from the filter in the first place. As we move into desktop use
of hyperlinked digital libraries, we fracture the traditional bibliographic
categories across media, versions, genres, and author. The freedom entailed
is that we can customize our own library spaces; but as Jo Freeman (1972)
pointed out in her classic article, �The Tyranny of Structurelessness,�
this is also so much more work that we may fall into a lowest-level convenience
classification rather than a high-level semantic one. In one of our digital
library projects at Illinois, for example, several undergraduates we interviewed
in focus groups stated that they would just get five references for a term
paper -- any five -- since that�s what the professor wanted, and they�d
better be ones that are listed electronically and available without walking
across campus.
<p>The ICD classification is in many ways an ideal mirror of how people
designing global information schemes struggle with uncertainty, ambiguity,
standardization, and the practicalities of data quality. Digging into the
archives, and reading the ICD closely through its changes, reveals some
of the upstream, design-oriented decisions informing the negotiated order
achieved by the vast system of forms, boxes, software, and death certificates.
At the same time, we have been constantly aware of the human suffering
often occasioned by the apparently bloodless apparatus of paperwork through
which these data are collected.
<p><u>Part 2: Classification and Biography</u>
<p>Our second section of this book looks at two cases where the lives of
individuals are broken, twisted, and torqued by their encounters with classification
systems. This often-invisible anguish informs another level of ethical
inquiry. Once having been made, the classification systems are applied
to individual cases � sometimes resulting in a kind of surreal bureaucratic
landscape. Sociologist Max Weber spoke of the "iron cage of bureaucracy"
hemming in the lives of modern workers and families. The cage formed by
classification systems can be constraining in just this way � although
cage might be too impoverished a metaphor to describe its variations and
occasional stretches. In Chapters 5 and 6, we look at biography and classification.
We chose two examples where classification has become a direct tool mediating
human suffering. Our first case concerns tuberculosis patients, and the
impact of disease classification on their lives. We use historical data
to discuss the experience of the disease within the tuberculosis asylum.
<p>Tuberculosis patients, like many with chronic illness, live under a
confusing regime of categories and metrics (see also Ziporyn, 1992). Many
people were incarcerated for years � some for decades � waiting for the
disease to run its course, to achieve a cure at high altitudes, or to die
there. They were subjected to a constant battery of measurements: lung
capacity, auscultation, body temperature and pulse rate, X-rays, and, as
they were developed, laboratory tests of blood and other bodily fluids.
The results of the tests determined the degree of freedom from the sanatorium
regime, as well as, ultimately, the date of release.
<p>As will be no surprise to medical sociologists, the interpretation and
negotiations of the tests between doctor and patient were fraught with
questions of the social value of the patient (middle class patients being
thought more compliant and reliable when on furlough from the asylumthan
those from lower classes); with gender stereotypes; and with the gradual
adaptation of the patient�s biographical expectations to the period of
incarceration. Thomas Mann�s <i>The Magic Mountain</i> and Julius Roth�s
<i>Timetables
</i>are
full of stories of classification and metrication. We examine how different
timelines, and expectations about those timelines, unfold in the two remarkable
volumes. Biography, career, the state of the medical art with respect to
the disease, and the public health adjudication of tuberculosis are all
intertwined against the landscape of the sanatorium.
<p>Life in the sanatorium has a surreal, almost nightmarish quality, as
detailed by Mann, Roth and many other writers throughout the twentieth
century. This sense comes precisely from the misalignment between a patient�s
life expectations, the uncertainties of the disease and of the treatment,
and the negotiations laden with other sorts of interactional burdens. It
is one thing to be ill and in the hospital, with an indefinite release
date. It is another when the date of release includes one�s ability to
negotiate well with the physicians, their interpretation of the latest
research, and the exigencies of public health forms and red tape. We call
this agglomeration <i>torque</i>, a twisting of timelines that pull at
each other, and bend or twist both patient biography and the process of
metrication. When all are aligned, there is no sense of torque or stress;
when they pull against each other over a long period, a nightmare texture
emerges.
<p>A similar torque is found in our second case in this section, that of
race classification and reclassification under apartheid in South Africa.
Between 1950 and the fall of apartheid forty years later, South Africans
were ruled under an extremely rigid, comprehensive system of race classification.
Divided into four main �racial� groups (White/European, Bantu (Black),
Asian and Colored (Mixed Race)), people�s lives were rigidly segregated.
The segregation extended from so-called petty apartheid (separate bus stops,
water fountains and toilets) to rights of work, residency, education and
freedom of movement. This system became the target of worldwide protest,
and eventually came to a formal end. These facts are common knowledge.
What has been less well documented or publicized are the actual techniques
used to classify people by race. In Chapter 6, we examine in detail some
cases of mixed-race people who applied to be re-classified after their
initial racial designation by the state. These borderline cases serve to
illuminate the underlying architecture of apartheid. This was a mixture
of brute power, confused eugenics and appropriations of anthropological
theories of race. The scientific reason given for apartheid by the white
supremacist Nationalist Party was �separate development� � the idea that
in order to develop naturally, the races must develop separately.
<p>In pursuing this ideology, of course, people and families that crossed
the color barrier were problematic. If a natural scientific explanation
was given for apartheid, systematic means should be available to winnow
white from black, colored from black and so on. As the chapter delineates,
this attempt was fraught with inconsistencies and local work-arounds, as
people never easily fit any categories. Over 100,000 people made formal
appeals concerning their race classification; most were denied.
<p>Although it lies at a political extreme, these cases form a continuum
with the classification of people at different stages of tuberculosis.
In both cases, biographies and categories fall along often-conflicting
trajectories. Lives are twisted, even torn, in the attempt to force the
one into the other. These torques may be petty or grand, but they are a
way of understanding the co-construction of lives and their categories.
<p><u>Part 3: Classification and Work Practice</u>
<p>In Part 3, Chapters 7 and 8, we will look at how classification systems
organize and are organized by work practice. We will look at the effort
of a group of nursing scientists based at the University of Iowa and led
by Joanne McCloskey and Gloria Bulechek to produce a classification of
nursing interventions. Their Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC)
aims to depict the range of activities that nurses carry out in their daily
routines. Their original system consisted of a list of some 336 interventions;
each comprised of a label, a definition, a set of activities, and a short
list of background readings. Each of those interventions is in turn classified
within a taxonomy of six domains and 26 classes. For example, one of the
tasks nurses commonly perform is preparing and monitoring intravenous medication.
The nursing intervention "Epidural Analgesia Administration" is defined
as: "preparation and delivery of narcotic analgesics into the epidural
space"; another common one, "Cough Enhancement", groups activities designed
to help respiration.
<p>The Iowa NIC researchers built up their system of nursing interventions
inductively. They created a preliminary list that distinguished between
nursing interventions and activities, then nurtured a large grassroots
network of nursing researchers. This group narrowed the preliminary list
of interventions to the original 336 published in Nursing Interventions
Classification, and further validated them via surveys and focus groups.
Different interventions were reviewed for clinical relevance, and a coding
scheme was developed. The classification system grew through a cooperative
process, with nurses in field sites trying out categories, and suggesting
new ones in a series of regional and specialist meetings. Since 1992, the
nurses have added over 50 interventions to their original list. We attended
a number of these meetings, and interviewed many of the nurses involved.
<p>Caring work such as calming and educating patients, usually done by
nurses, often cuts across specific medical diagnostic categories. The NIC
investigators use their list of interventions in order to make visible
and legitimate the work that nurses do. The idea is that it will be used
to compare work across hospitals, specialties and geographical areas, and
to build objective research measures for the outcomes. NIC, although still
relatively young, promises to be a major rallying point for nurses in the
decades to come. Before NIC, much nursing work was invisible to the medical
record. As one nurse poignantly said, "we were just thrown in with the
cost of the room." Another said, "I am not a bed!" The traditional, quintessential
nurse would be ever present, caregiving, and helpful -- but not a part
of the formal patient-doctor information structure. Of course, this invisibility
is bound up with traditional gender roles, as with librarians, social workers
and primary school teachers.
<p>But as with the ICD, classifying events is difficult. In the case of
NIC, the politics move from a politics of certainty to a politics of ambiguity.
The essence of this politics is walking a tightrope between increased visibility
and increased surveillance; between over-specifying what a nurse <i>should</i>
do and taking away discretion from the individual practitioner.
<p>When discretion and the tacit knowledge that is part of every occupation
meet the medical bureaucracy which would account for every pill and every
moment of health care workers� time, contradictions ensue. This is especially
true in the "softer" areas of care. Social-psychological caregiving is
also one of the areas where this dilemma is prominent. For example, NIC
lists as nursing interventions "anticipatory guidance" and "mood management"
-- preparation for grief, or surgery. Difficult though these are to capture
in a classification scheme, one much more difficult is "humor." How can
one capture humor as a deliberate nursing intervention? Does sarcasm, irony,
or laughter count as a nursing intervention? When do you stop? How to reimburse
humor, how to measure this kind of care? No one would dispute its importance,
but it is by its nature a situated and subjective action. A grey area of
common sense remains for the individual staff nurse to define whether some
of the nursing interventions are worth classifying.
<p>There are continuing tensions within NIC between just this kind of common
sense, and abstracting away from the local in order to standardize and
compare, while at the same time rendering invisible work visible. Nurses�
work is often invisible for a combination of good and bad reasons. Nurses
have to ask mundane questions, rearrange bedcovers, move a patient�s hand
so that it is closer to a button, and sympathize about the suffering involved
in illness. Bringing this work out into the open and differentiating its
components can mean belaboring the obvious or risking being too vague.
<p>One of the battlefields where comparability and control appear as opposing
factors is in linking NIC to costing. NIC researchers assert that the classification
of nursing interventions will allow a determination of the costs of services
provided by nurses and planning for resources needed in nursing practice.
As the nurse above says, nursing treatments are usually bundled in with
the room price. NIC is used in the development of nursing health care systems
and may provide a planning vehicle for previously untracked costs. As we
shall see, NIC can also be problematic for nurses. Like any other classification
scheme which renders work visible, it can also render surveillance easier
� and could in the end lead to a Tayloristic dissection of the tasks of
nursing (as the NIC designers are well aware). So-called unskilled tasks
may be taken out of their hands and the profession as a whole may suffer
a loss of autonomy and the substitution of rigid procedure for common sense.
<p>As in the case of the ICD, there are many layers of meaning involved
in developing and implementing nursing classification. NIC might look like
a straightforward organizational tool: it is in fact much more than that.
It merges science, practice, bureaucracy and information systems. NIC coordinates
bodies, impairments, charts, reimbursement systems, vocabularies, patients,
and health care professionals. Ultimately, it provides a manifesto for
nursing as an organized occupation, a basis for a scientific domain and
a tool for organizing work practices.
<p><b>Why it is important to study classification systems</b>
<p>The sheer density of the collisions of classification schemes in our
lives calls for a new kind of science, a new set of metaphors, linking
traditional social science and computer and information science. We need
a topography of things such as the distribution of ambiguity; the fluid
dynamics of how classification systems meet up � a plate tectonics rather
than static geology. This new science will draw on the best empirical studies
of workarounds, information use, and mundane tools such as desktop folders
and file cabinets (perhaps peering backwards out from the web and into
the practices). It will also use the best of object-oriented programming
and other areas of computer science to describe this territory. It will
build on years of valuable research on classification in library and information
science.
<p>Let us finish this introduction with a future scenario that symbolizes
this abstract endeavor. Imagine that you�re walking through a forest of
inter-articulated branches. Some are covered with ice or snow, and the
sun melts their touching tips to reveal space between. Some are so thickly
brambled they seem solid. Others are oddly angular in nature, like esplanaded
trees.
<p>Some of the trees are wild, some have been cultivated. Some are old
and gnarled, and some are tiny shoots; some of the old ones are nearly
dead, others show green leaves. The forest is still wild, but there are
some parks, and some protocols for finding one�s way along, at least on
the known paths. Helicopters flying overhead can quickly tell you how many
types of each tree, even each leaf, there are in the world, but they cannot
yet give you a guidebook for birdwatching or forestry management. There
is a lot of underbrush and a complex ecology of soil bacteria, flora and
fauna.
<p>Now imagine that the forest is a huge information space, and each of
the trees and bushes are classification systems. Those who make them up
and use them are the animals and plants, and the soil is a mix of the Internet,
the paper world, and other communication infrastructures.
<p>Your job is to describe this forest. You may write a basic manual of
forestry, or paint a landscape, compose an opera, or improve the maps throughout.
What will your product look like? Who will use it?
<p>In this book, we show from our studies of medical, scientific and race
classification that, like a good forest, some areas will be left wild,
or in darkness, or even unmapped (that is, some ambiguity will remain).
We will show that abstract schema that do not take <i>use</i> into account
-- say, maps that leave out landmarks or altitude or how readers use maps
-- will simply fail. (That is, common sense will be seen as the precious
resource that it is.) We intuit that a mixture of scientific, poetic, and
artistic talents, such as that represented in the hypertextual world, will
be crucial to this task. We will demonstrate the value of a mixture of
formal and folk classifications, used sensibly in the context of people�s
lives.
<p><b>Chapter One: Some Tricks of the Trade in Analyzing Classification</b>
<dir>
<dir><i><font face="New York,Times New Roman">My guess is that we have
a folk theory of categorization itself. It says that things come in well-defined
kinds, that the kinds are characterized by shared properties, and that
there is one right taxonomy of the kinds.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="New York,Times New Roman">It is easier to show what is
wrong with a scientific theory than with a folk theory. A folk theory defines
common sense itself. When the folk theory and the technical theory converge,
it gets even tougher to see where that theory gets in the way � or even
that it is a theory at all (Lakoff, 1987: 121).</font></i></dir>
</dir>
Information infrastructure is a tricky thing to analyze.&nbsp; Really good,
usable systems disappear, almost by definition. The easier they are to
use, the harder they are to see. As well, most of the time, the bigger
they are, the harder they are to see. Unless we are electricians or building
inspectors, we rarely think about the myriad of databases, standards, and
instruction manuals subtending our reading lamps, much less about the politics
of the electric grid that they tap into. And so on, as many layers of technology
accrue and expand over space and time. Systems of classification (and of
standardization) form a juncture of social organization, moral order, and
layers of technical integration.&nbsp; Each sub-system inherits, increasingly
as it scales up, the inertia of the installed base of systems that have
come before.
<p>Infrastructures are never transparent for everyone, and their workability
as they scale up becomes increasingly complex.&nbsp; Through due methodological
attention to the architecture and use of these systems, we can achieve
a deeper understanding of how it is that individuals (and communities)
meet infrastructure.&nbsp; We know that this means, at the least, an understanding
of infrastructure that includes:
<ul>
<li>
a historical process of development of many tools, arranged for a wide
variety of users, and made to work in concert;</li>

<li>
a practical match between routines of work practice, technology, and wider-scale
organizational and technical resources;</li>

<li>
a rich set of negotiated compromises ranging from epistemology to data
entry which are both available and transparent to communities of users;</li>

<li>
a negotiated order in which all of the above, recursively, can function
together.</li>
</ul>
The following shows a more elaborate definition of infrastructure, following
Star and Ruhleder (1996), who emphasize that one person�s infrastructure
may be another�s barrier:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Figure 4 Star and Ruhleder�s Definition of Infrastructure</b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Embeddedness</i>. Infrastructure is sunk into, inside of, other structures,
social arrangements and technologies;</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Transparency</i>. Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense
that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each
task, but invisibly supports those tasks;</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Reach or scope</i>. This may be either spatial or temporal -- infrastructure
has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice;</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Learned as part of membership</i>. The taken-for-grantedness of artifacts
and organizational arrangements is a <i>sine qua non</i> of membership
in a community of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Star, 1996). Strangers
and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned
about. New participants acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects
as they become members;</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Links with conventions of practice</i>. Infrastructure both shapes and
is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice, e.g. the ways
that cycles of day-night work are affected by and affect electrical power
rates and needs. Generations of typists have learned the QWERTY keyboard;
its limitations are inherited by the computer keyboard and thence by the
design of today�s computer furniture (Becker, 1982);</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Embodiment of standards</i>. Modified by scope and often by conflicting
conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other
infrastructures and tools in a standardized fashion.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Built on an installed base</i>. Infrastructure does not grow <i>de novo</i>;
it wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths
and limitations from that base. Optical fibers run along old railroad lines;
new systems are designed for backward-compatibility; and failing to account
for these constraints may be fatal or distorting to new development processes
(Monteiro and Hanseth, 1996).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Becomes visible upon breakdown.</i> The normally invisible quality of
working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down,
the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout. Even when there are back-up
mechanisms or procedures, their existence further highlights the now-visible
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally.</i> Because
infrastructure is big, layered and complex, and because it means different
things locally, it is never changed from above. Changes take time and negotiation,
and adjustment with other aspects of the systems involved.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
This chapter offers four themes, methodological points of departure for
the analysis of these complex relationships. Each theme operates as a gestalt
switch - it comes in the form of an <i>infrastructural inversion</i> (Bowker,
1994). This inversion is a struggle against the tendency of infrastructure
to disappear (except when breaking down). It means learning to look closely
at technologies and arrangements which, by design and by habit, tend to
fade into the woodwork (sometimes literally!).
<p>Infrastructural inversion means recognizing the depths of interdependence
of technical networks and standards, on the one hand, and the real work
of politics and knowledge production on the other. It foregrounds these
normally invisible Lilliputian threads, and furthermore gives them causal
prominence in many areas normally attributed to heroic actors, social movements,
or cultural mores. The inversion is similar to the argument made by Becker
(1982) in his book <i>Art Worlds. </i>Most history and social analysis
of art has neglected the details of infrastructure within which communities
of artistic practice emerge. Becker�s inversion examines the conventions
and constraints of the material artistic infrastructure, and its ramifications.
For example, the convention of musical concerts lasting about three hours
ramifies throughout the producing organization. Parking attendants, unions,
ticket takers, and theater rentals are arranged in cascading dependence
on this interval of time. An eight-hour musical piece, which is occasionally
written, means rearranging all of these expectations � which in turn is
so expensive that such productions are rare. Or paintings are about the
size, usually, that will hang comfortably on a wall. They are also the
size that fits rolls of canvas, the skills of framers, and the very doorways
of museums and galleries. These constraints are mutable only at great cost,
and artists must always consider them before violating them.
<p>Scientific inversions of infrastructure were the theme of a pathbreaking
edited volume, <i>The Right Tools for the Job: At Work in Twentieth-Century
Life Sciences</i> (Clarke and Fujimura, 1992). The purpose of this volume
was to tell the history of biology in a new way � from the point of view
of the materials that constrain and enable biological researchers. Rats,
petri dishes, taxidermy, planaria, drosophila and test tubes take center
stage in this narrative. The standardization of genetic research on a few
specially-bred organisms (notably drosophila) has constrained the pacing
of research, and the ways the questions may be framed, and has given biological
supply houses an important, invisible role in research horizons. While
elephants or whales might answer different kinds of biological questions,
they are obviously unwieldy lab animals. While pregnant cow�s urine played
a critical role in the discovery and isolation of reproductive hormones,
no historian of biology had thought it important to describe the task of
obtaining gallons of it on a regular basis. Adele Clarke (1998) puckishly
relates her discovery, in the memoirs of a biologist, of the technique
required to do so: tickle the cow�s labia in order to make her urinate.
A starkly different view of the tasks of laboratory biology emerges from
this image. It must be added to the processes of stabling, feeding, impregnating,
and caring for the cows involved. The supply chain, techniques and animal
handling methods had to be invented along with biology�s conceptual frame;
they are not accidental, but constitutive.
<p>Our infrastructural inversion with respect to information technologies
and their attendant classification systems follows this line of analysis.
Like the cow�s urine or the 8-hour concert, we have found many examples
of counterintuitive, often humorous struggles with constraints and conventions
in the crafting of classifications. For instance, as we shall see in Chapter
5, in analyzing the experience of tuberculosis patients in Mann�s <i>The
Magic Mountain, </i>we found the story of one woman who had been incarcerated
so long in the sanatorium that leaving it became unthinkable. She recovered
from the disease, but tried to subvert the diagnosis of wellness. When
the doctors took her temperature, she would surreptitiously dip the thermometer
in hot water to make it seem that she still had a fever. On discovering
this, the doctors created a thermometer without markings, so that she could
not tell what the mercury column indicated. They called this "the silent
sister." The silent sister immediately becomes itself a telling indicator
of the entangled infrastructure, medical politics, and the use of metrics
in classifying tubercular patients. It tells a rich metaphorical story,
and may become a concept useful beyond the rarified walls of the fictional
Swiss asylum. What other silent sisters will we encounter in our infrastructural
inversion � what surveillance, deception, caring, struggling, or negotiating?
<p>In the sections below, we present four themes that require the special
double vision implied in the anecdotes above. They frame the new way of
seeing which brings to life large-scale, bureaucratic classifications and
standards. Without this map, excursions into this aspect of information
infrastructure can be stiflingly boring. Many classifications appear as
nothing more than lists of numbers with labels attached, buried in software
menus, users� manuals, or other references. As we discuss in Chapter 2,
new eyes are needed for reading classification systems, for restoring the
deleted and desiccated narratives to these peculiar cultural/technical/scientific
artifacts.
<p><b>Methodological Themes for Infrastructural Inversion</b>
<p><b>1. Ubiquity</b>
<p>The first major theme is the <b>ubiquity</b> of classifying and standardizing.
Classification schemes and standards literally saturate our environment.
In the built world we inhabit, thousands and thousands of standards are
used everywhere, from setting up the plumbing in a house to assembling
a car engine to transferring a file from one computer to another. Consider
the canonically simple act of writing a letter longhand, putting it in
an envelope and mailing it. There are standards for (inter alia): paper
size, the distance between lines in lined paper, envelope size, the glue
on the envelope, the size of stamps, their glue, the ink in your pen, the
sharpness of its nib, the composition of the paper (which in turn can be
broken down to the nature of the watermark, if any; the degree of recycled
material used in its production, the definition of what counts as recycling).
And so forth.
<p>Similarly, in any bureaucracy, classifications abound -- consider the
simple but increasingly common classifications that are used when you dial
an airline for information ("if you are traveling domestically, press 1";
"if you want information about flight arrivals and departures...."). And
once the airline has hold of you, you are classified by them as a frequent
flyer (normal, gold or platinum); corporate or individual; tourist or business
class; short haul or long haul (different fare rates and scheduling apply).
<p>Howard Becker relates a delightful anecdote concerning his classification
by an airline. A relative working for one of the airlines told him how
desk clerks handle customer complaints. The strategy is first to try to
solve the problem. If the customer remains unsatisfied, and becomes very
angry in the process, the clerk dubs him or her "an irate". The clerk then
calls the supervisor, "I have an irate on the line," shorthand for the
category of <i>very</i> irritated passenger.
<p>One day Becker was having a difficult interaction with the same airline.
He called the airline desk, and in a calm tone of voice, said, "Hello,
my name is Howard Becker and I�m an irate. Can you help me with this ticket?"
The clerk began to sputter, "How did you know that word?!!" Becker had
succeeded in unearthing a little of the hidden classificatory apparatus
behind the scenes at the airline. He notes that the interaction after this
speeded up and went particularly smoothly.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This categorical saturation furthermore forms a complex web. While it
is possible to pull out a single classification scheme or standard for
reference purposes, in reality none of them stand alone. So a subproperty
of ubiquity is interdependence, and frequently, integration. A systems
approach might see the proliferation of both standards and classifications
as purely a matter of integration -- almost like a gigantic web of interoperability.
Yet the sheer density of these phenomena go beyond questions of interoperability.
They are layered, tangled, textured; they interact to form an ecology as
well as a flat set of compatibilities. That is to say, they facilitate
the co-ordination of heterogeneous �dispositifs techniques� (Foucault,
1975). They are lodged in different communities of practice - such as laboratories,
records offices, insurance companies and so forth. There <i>are </i>spaces
between (unclassified, non-standard areas), of course, and these are equally
important to the analysis. It seems that increasingly these spaces are
marked as unclassified and non-standard.
<p>It is a struggle to step back from this complexity and think about the
issue of ubiquity, rather than try to trace the myriad connections in any
one case. The ubiquity of classifications and standards is curiously difficult
to see � as we are quite schooled in ignoring both, for a variety of interesting
reasons. We also need concepts for understanding movements, textures, and
shifts that will grasp patterns within the ubiquitous larger phenomenon.
The distribution of residual categories (�not elsewhere classified� or
�other�) is one such concept. �Others� are everywhere, structuring social
order. Another such concept might be what Strauss et al. (1985) call a
�cumulative mess trajectory.� In medicine, this occurs when one has an
illness, is given a medicine to cure the illness, but incurs a serious
side effect, which then needs to be treated with another medicine, etc.
If the trajectory becomes so tangled that you cannot turn back, and the
interactions multiply, �cumulative mess� results. We see this phenomenon
in the interaction of categories and standards all the time -- ecological
examples are particularly rich places to look.
<p><b>Materiality and Texture</b>
<p>The second methodological departure point is that<b> </b>classifications
and standards are <b>material</b>, as well as symbolic. How do we perceive
this densely saturated classified and textured world? Under the sway of
cognitive idealism, it is easy to see classifications as properties of
mind and standards as ideal numbers or floating cultural inheritances.
But they have material force in the world. They are built into and embedded
in every feature of the built environment (and many of the nature/culture
borderlands, such as with engineered genetic organisms).
<p>All classification and standardization schemes are a mixture of physical
entities such as paper forms, plugs, or software instructions encoded in
silicon, and conventional arrangements such as speed and rhythm, dimension,
and how specifications are implemented. Perhaps because of this mixture,
the web of intertwined schemes can be difficult to see. In general, the
trick is to question every apparently natural easiness in the world around
us and look for the work involved in making it easy. Within a project or
on a desktop, the seeing consists in seamlessly moving between the physical
and the conventional. So when a computer programmer writes some lines of
Java code, she moves within conventional constraints and makes innovations
based on them; at the same time, she strikes plastic keys, shifts notes
around on a desktop, and consults manuals for various standards and other
information. If we were to try to list out all the classifications and
standards involved in writing a program, the list could run to pages. Classifications
include types of objects, types of hardware, matches between requirements
categories and code categories, and meta-categories such as the goodness
of fit of the piece of code with the larger system under development. Standards
range from the precise integration of the underlying hardware to the 60Hz
power coming out of the wall through a standard size plug.
<p>Merely reducing the description to the physical aspect such as the plugs
does not get us anywhere interesting in terms of the actual mixture of
physical and conventional or symbolic. A good operations researcher could
describe how and whether things would work together, often purposefully
blurring the physical/conventional boundaries in making the analysis. But
what is missing is a sense of the landscape of work as experienced by those
within it. It gives no sense of something as important as the texture of
an organization: it is smooth or rough? Bare or knotty? What is needed
is a sense of the topography of all of the arrangements -- are they colliding?
co-extensive? gappy? orthogonal? One way to get at these questions is to
take quite literally the kinds of metaphors that people use when describing
their experience of organizations, bureaucracies, and information systems,
discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
<p>When we think of classifications and standards as both material and
symbolic, we adapt a set of tools not usually applied to them. There are
tools for analysing built structures, such as structural integrity, enclosures
and confinements, permeability, and durability, among many others. Structures
have texture, and depth. The textural way of speaking of classifications
and standards is common in organizations and groups. Metaphors of tautness,
knots, fabrics and networks pervade modern language (Lakoff and Johnson,
1980).
<p><b>The Indeterminacy of the Past: Multiple times, multiple voices</b>
<p>The third methodological theme concerns <b>the past as indeterminate</b>.
We are constantly revising our knowledge of the past in light of new developments
in the present. This is not a new idea to historiography, or to biography.
We change our resumes as we acquire new skills to seem like smooth, planned
paths of development, even if the change had been unexpected or undesired.
When we become members of new social worlds, we often retell our life stories
in new terminology. A common example of this is religious conversion, where
the past is retold as exemplifying errors, sinning and repentance (Strauss,
1959). Or when coming out as gay or lesbian, childhood behaviors and teenage
crushes become indicators of early inklings of sexual choice (Wolfe and
Stanley, 1980).
<p>At wider levels of scale, these revisions also mean the introduction
of new voices � many possible kinds of interpretations of categories, texts,
and artifacts. Multiple voices and silences are represented in any scheme
that attempts to sort out the world. No one classification organizes reality
for everyone -- e.g. the red light-yellow light-green light traffic light
distinctions don�t work for blind people (who need sound coding). In looking
to classification schemes as ways of ordering the past, it is easy to forget
those who have been overlooked in this way. Thus, the indeterminacy of
the past implies recovering multi-vocality; it also means understanding
how standard narratives that seem universal have been constructed (Star,
1991a).
<p>There is no way of ever getting access to the past except through classification
systems of one sort or another - formal or informal, hierarchical or not
... . Take the apparently unproblematic statement: "In 1640, the English
Revolution occurred; this led to a twenty year period in which the English
had no monarchy". The classifications involved here, all problematic, include:
<ul>
<li>
the current segmentation of time into days, months and years. Accounts
of the English revolution generally use the Gregorian calendar, which was
adopted some hundred years later - so causing translation problems with
contemporary documents;</li>

<li>
the classification of �peoples� into English, Irish, Scots, French and
so on. These designations were by no means so clear at the time - the whole
discourse of �national genius� or character really only arose in the nineteenth
century;</li>

<li>
the classification of events into revolutions, reforms, revolts, rebellions
and so forth (cf. Furet, 1978 on thinking the French revolution). There
really was no concept of �revolution� at the time; our current conception
is marked by the historiographical work of Karl Marx.</li>

<li>
what do we classify as being a �monarchy�? There is a strong historiographical
tradition that says that Oliver Cromwell was a monarch - he walked, talked
and acted like one after all. Under this view, there is no hiatus at all
in this English institution; rather a usurper took the throne.</li>
</ul>
There are two major historiographic schools of thought with respect to
using classification systems on the past. One maintains that we should
only use classifications available to actors at the time, much as an ethnographer
tries faithfully to mirror the categories of their respondents. Authors
in this tradition warn against the dangers of anachronism. Hacking (1995)
on child abuse is a sophisticated version which we discuss in Chapter 7.
If a category did not exist contemporaneously, it should not be retroactively
applied.
<p>The other school of thought holds that we should use the real classifications
that progress in the arts and sciences has uncovered. Often, history informed
by current sociology will take this path. For example, Tort�s (1989) work
on �genetic� classification systems (which were not so called at the time,
but which are of vital interest to the Foucaldian problematic) imposes
a <i>post hoc</i> order on nineteenth century classification schemes in
a variety of sciences. Even though those schemes were perceived by their
creators as responding solely to the specific needs of the discipline they
were dealing with (etymology, say, or mineralogy), he demonstrates that
there was a link between many different schemes (both direct in terms of
people shifting disciplines and conceptual in terms of their organization)
that allows us to perceive an order nowhere apparent to contemporaries.
<p>From a Pragmatist point of view, both aspects are important in analyzing
the consequences of modern systems of classification and standardization.
We seek always to understand classification systems according to the work
that they are doing, and the networks within which they are embedded. That
entails both an understanding of the categories of those designing and
using the systems, and a set of analytic questions derived from our own
concerns as analysts.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#3333FF"><i>When is it a Harley</i>?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">One of the ways the past becomes indeterminate
is through gradual shifts in what it means to "really be" something --
the essence of it.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Sitting in a tattoo parlor, surrounded by people
I don�t usually hang out with. Young men in black leather vests and sun-bleached
hair. I turn to the waiting room reading material, which in this case is
the monthly Thunder Press, a newsletter for motorbike aficionados. The
lead article asks the question: "Is It Still a Harley" if you have customized
your bike yourself. The Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles makes the definitive
call:</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">"Anything that is not totally factory-built will
make it a reconstructed motorcycle, and it will be called �Assembled� on
the title." (p. 69)</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A major activity in the Harley social world is
customizing features of one�s motorcycle, and there are important symbolic
and affiliative signs attached to the customizing process. Deleting the
name Harley from the registration form is perceived as an insult to the
owner, and this insult is stitched together in the article with others
that come from the government toward bikers (restricting meeting places,
insisting on helmet-wearing, being overly enthusiastic in enforcing traffic
violations by bikers).</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">This is a pure example of the politics of essence,
of identity politics. It is echoed in many areas of life, for example,
in James Davis� (1991) classic study, <i>Who Is Black?</i> where the question
of the one-drop rule in the United States, and the rejection of mixed-race
people as a legitimate category is an old and a cruel story. The central
process here is the distillation of the <i>sine qua non</i> out from the
messy and crenellated surrounds -- the rejection of marginality in favor
of purity.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">When this occurs, the suffering of the marginal
becomes privatized and distributed, creating the conditions for pluralistic
ignorance ("I�m the only one"). Meeting the purity criteria of the essentialized
category also becomes bureaucratized, and again the onus is shifted to
the individual alone. Only when the category is joined with a social movement
can the black box of essence be re-opened, as for example with the recent
uprisings and demonstrations of mixed race Hispanic people toward the US
Census and its rigid categories. The problem becomes clear if one is both
Black and Hispanic, a common combination in the Caribbean. Which shall
be the master trait through which the government perceives you?</font>

<p>When we ask historical questions about the deeply and heterogeneously
structured space of classification systems and standards, we are dealing
with a 4-dimensional archaeology. The systems move in space, time and process.
Some of the archaeological structures we uncover are stable, some in motion;
some evolving, some decaying. They are not consistent. An institutional
memory, about, for example, an epidemic, can be held simultaneously and
with internal contradictions (sometimes piecemeal or distributed and sometimes
with entirely different stories at different locations) across a given
institutional space.
<p>In the case of AIDS, classifications have shifted significantly over
the last 20 years, including the invention of the category in the 1980s
(from Gay-Related Immune Disorder (GRID) through a chain of other monikers
to the now-accepted Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). It is now to
some extent possible to look backwards at cases which might previously
have been AIDS (Grmek, 1990) before we had the category (a problematic
gaze to be sure, as Bruno Latour (forthcoming) has written about tuberculosis).
There are epidemiological stories about trying to collect information about
a shameful disease; there is a wealth of personal and public narratives
about living with it. There is a public health story and a virology story,
which use different category systems. There are the standardized forms
of insurance companies and the categories and standards of the census bureau.
When an attempt was made to combine these data in the 1980s to disenfranchise
young men living in San Francisco from health insurance, the resultant
political challenge stopped the combination of this data from being so
used. At the same time, the San Francisco blood banks refused for years
to employ HIV screening, thus denying the admission of another category
to their blood labeling -- as Shilts (1987) tells us, with many casualties
as a result. Whose story has categorical ascendancy here? That question
is forever morally moot � all of the stories are important, and all of
the categories tell a different one.
<p><b>Practical Politics</b>
<p>The fourth major theme is uncovering <b>the practical politics of classifying
and standardizing</b>. This is the design end of the spectrum of investigating
categories and standards as technologies. There are two processes associated
with these politics: arriving at categories and standards, and, along the
way, deciding what will be visible or invisible within the system.
<p>It follows from the indeterminacy discussed above that the spread or
enforcement of categories and standards involves negotiation or force.
Whatever appears as universal or, indeed, standard, is the result of negotiations,
organizational processes, and conflict. How do these negotiations take
place? Who determines the final outcome in preparing a formal classification?
Visibility issues arise as one decides where to make the cuts in the system,
for example, down to what level of detail one specifies a description of
work, of an illness, of a setting. Because there are always advantages
and disadvantages to being visible, this becomes crucial in the workability
of the schema. As well, ordinary biases of what should be visible, or legitimated,
within a particular scheme, are always in action. The tradeoffs involved
in this sort of politics are discussed in Chapters 5 (on tuberculosis)
and 7 (on nursing work).
<p>Someone, somewhere, often a body of people in the proverbial gray suits
and smoke-filled rooms, must decide and argue over the minutiae of classifying
and standardizing. The negotiations themselves form the basis for a fascinating
practical ontology -- our favorite example is when is someone really alive?
Is it breathing, attempts at breathing, movement....? And how long must
each of those last? Whose voice will determine the outcome is sometimes
an exercise of pure power: we, the holders of Western medicine and scions
of colonial regimes, will decide what a disease is, and simply obviate
systems such as acupuncture or Aryuvedic medicine. Sometimes the negotiations
are more subtle, involving questions such as the disparate viewpoints of
an immunologist and a surgeon, or a public health official (interested
in even ONE case of the plague) and a statistician (for whom one case is
not relevant).

<p><b><font color="#3333FF">There�s no such thing as a rodent</font></b>
<p><font color="#3333FF">An article in the San Jose Mercury News by Rick
Weiss declares: "Researchers say there�s no such thing as a rodent." He
quotes an article from <i>Nature</i>, which argues thatthe 2,000 species
of animals ordinarily considered rodents, including rats, mice, and guinea
pigs -- did not evolve from a common ancestor. The finding is deeply controversial.
Weiss says, "On one side are researchers who have spent their careers hunched
over fossils or skeletal remains to determine which animals evolved from
which." On the other, the article continues, are those who would use DNA
analysis to make the determination. The fossil studiers say that DNA is
not yet accurate enough. The classification of species has always been
deeply controversial. Biologists speak of a rough cut among their ranks:
lumpers (those who see fewer categories and more commonalties) vs. splitters
(those who would name a new species with fewer kinds of difference cited).
There are always practical consequences for these names. Splitters, for
example, often included people who wanted a new species named after them,
and the more species there are, the more likely is an eponymous label.
The deliberately provocative headline of this article demands a response:
"well, don�t tell that to my cat." We often refer implicitly in this fashion
to the power of naming -- blurring the name of the category with its members.
(<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>. ( June 13, 1996: 5A - by Rick Weiss)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Once a system is in place, the practical politics of these decisions
are often forgotten, literally buried in archives (when records are kept
at all) or built into software or the sizes and compositions of things.
In addition to our archaeological expeditions into the records of such
negotiations, this book provides some observations of the negotiations
in action.
<p>Finally, even where everyone agrees on how classifications or standards
should be established, there are often practical difficulties about how
to craft them. For example, a classification system with 20,000 bins on
every form is practically unusable for data entry purposes. The constraints
of technological record keeping come into play at every turn. For example,
the original International Classification of Diseases had some 200 diseases
not because of the nature of the human body and its problems but because
this was the maximum number that would fit the large census sheets then
in use.
<p>Sometimes the decision simply about how fine-grained to make the system
has political consequences as well. For instance, describing and recording
someone�s tasks, as in the case of nursing work, may mean controlling or
surveilling their work as well, and may imply an attempt to take away discretion.
After all, the loosest classification of work is accorded to those with
the most power and discretion, who are able to set their own terms. There
are financial stakes as well. In a study of a health insurance company�s
system of classifying for doctor and patient reimbursement, Gerson and
Star (1986), found that doctors wanted the most fine-grained of category
systems, so that each procedure could be reimbursed separately, and thus
most profitably. Data entry personnel and hospital administrators, among
others, wanted broader, simpler and coarser-grained categories for reasons
of efficiency. These conflicts were, however, invisible to the outside
world, which received only the forms for reimbursement purposes and a copy
of the codebook for reference. Both the content of the categories and the
structure of the overall scheme are concerns for due process within organizations
� whose voice will be heard, and when will enough data, of the right granularity,
have been collected?
<p><b>Infrastructure and Method: Convergence</b>
<p>These ubiquitous, textured classifications and standards help frame
our representation of the past and the sequencing of events in the present.
They can best be understood as doing the ever-local, ever-partial work
of making it appear that science describes nature (and nature alone) and
that politics is about social power (and social power alone). Consider
the case of psychoanalysts discussed at length in Young (1995); Kirk and
Kutchins (1992) and Kutchins and Kirk (1997). In order to receive reimbursement
for their procedures, they now need to couch them in a biomedical language
(the DSM). Theoretically, this rubric is anathema to them, systematically
replacing the categories of psychoanalysis with the language of the pharmacopoeia
and of the biochemistry of the brain. However, the DSM is the lingua franca
of the medical insurance companies. Thus, psychoanalysts use the categories
not only to obtain reimbursement, but as a shorthand to communicate with
each other. There are local translation mechanisms that allow the DSM to
continue to operate in this fashion, and at the same time, to become the
sole legal, recognized representation of mental disorder. A �reverse engineering�
of the DSM or the ICD reveals the multitude of local political and social
struggles and compromises which go into the constitution of a �universal�
classification.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Fitting Categories to Circumstances</b>
<p>An academic friend on the East Coast tells an anecdote of negotiation
with her long-term psychoanalyst about how to fill out her insurance forms.
She was able to receive several free sessions of therapy a year under her
health insurance plan. Each year, she and her therapist would discuss how
best to categorize her. It was important to represent the illness as serious
and long-term. At the same time, they were worried that the information
about the diagnosis might not always remain confidential. What could they
label her that would be both serious and non-stigmatizing? Finally, they
settled on the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive. No academic would ever
be penalized for being obsessive-compulsive, our friend concluded with
a wry laugh! (Kirk and Kutchins (1992) document similar negotiations between
psychiatrists and patients.)
<p>Standards, categories, technologies and phenomenology are increasingly
converging in large-scale information infrastructure. As we have indicated
in this chapter, this convergence poses both political and ethical questions.
These questions are by no means obvious in ordinary moral discourse. For
all the reasons given above, large-scale classification systems are often
invisible, erased by their naturalization into the routines of life. Conflict
and multiplicity are often buried beneath layers of obscure representation.
<p>Methodologically, we do not stand outside these systems, nor pronounce
on their mapping to some otherworldly �real� or �constructed� nature. Rather,
we are concerned with what they do, pragmatically speaking, as scaffolding
in the conduct of modern life. Part of that analysis means understanding
the co-construction of classification systems with the means for data collection
and validation.
<p>In order to clarify our position here, let us take an analogy. In the
early nineteenth century in England there were a huge number of capital
crimes - starting from stealing a loaf of bread and going up. However,
precisely because the penalties were so draconian, few juries would ever
impose the maximum sentence; and indeed there was actually a drastic reduction
in the number of executions even as the penal code was progressively strengthened.
There are two ways of writing this history - one can either concentrate
on the creation of the law; or one can concentrate on the way things worked
out in practice. This is very similar to the position taken in Latour�s<i>
We Have Never Been Modern </i>(1993). He argues that<i> </i>we can either
look at what scientists say that they are doing (working within a purified
realm of knowledge) or at what they actually are doing (manufacturing hybrids
of nature-culture). We think both are important. We are advocating here
a pragmatic methodological development -- pay more attention to the classification
and standardization work that allows for hybrids to be manufactured and
so more deeply explore the terrain of the politics of science in action.
<p>The point for us is that both words and deeds are valid kinds of account.
Early sociology of science in the actor-network tradition concentrated
on the ways in which it comes to seem that science gives an objective account
of natural order: trials of strength, enrolling of allies, cascades of
inscriptions and the operation of immutable mobiles (Latour, 1987; 1988).
It drew attention to the importance of the development of standards (though
not to the linked development of classification systems); but did not look
at these in detail. Sociologists of science invited us to look at the process
of producing something which looked like what the positivists alleged science
to be. We got to see the Janus face of science, as both constructed and
realist. In so doing we followed the actors, often ethnographically. We
shared their insights (allies must be enrolled, translation mechanisms
must be set in train so that, in the canonical case, Pasteur�s laboratory
work can be seen as a direct translation of the quest for French honor
after defeat in the battlefield - Latour, 1988).
<p>However, by the very nature of the method, we also shared the actors�
blindness. The actors being followed did not themselves <i>see</i> what
was excluded: they constructed a world in which that exclusion could occur.
Thus if we just follow the doctors who create the International Classification
of Diseases at the World Health Organization in Geneva, we will not see
the variety of representation systems that other cultures have for classifying
diseases of the body and spirit; and we will not see the fragile networks
these classification systems subtend. Rather, we will see only those who
are strong enough, and shaped in such a fashion as to impact allopathic
medicine. We will see the blind leading the blind.
<p>This blindness occurs by changing the world such that the system�s description
of reality becomes true. Thus, for example, consider the case where all
diseases are classified purely physiologically. Systems of medical observation
and treatment are set up such that physical manifestations are the only
manifestations recorded. Physical treatments are the only treatments available.
Under these conditions, then, logically schizophrenia may only result purely
and simply from a chemical imbalance in the brain. It will be impossible
to think or act otherwise. We have called this the principle of <i>convergence
</i>(Star
and Bowker, 1994; Star, Bowker and Neumann, in press).
<p><b>Resistance</b>
<p>Reality is �that which resists,� according to Latour�s (1987) pragmatist-inspired
definition. The resistances that designers and users encounter will change
the ubiquitous networks of classifications and standards. While convergence
may seem at times to create an inescapable cycle of feedback and verification,
the very multiplicity of people, things and processes involved mean that
they are never locked in for all time.
<p>The methods in this chapter offer an approach to resistance as a reading
of where and how political work is done in the world of classifications
and standards; and how such artifacts can be problematized and challenged.
Donald MacKenzie�s (1990) wonderful study of �missile accuracy� furnishes
the best example of this approach. In a concluding chapter to his book,
he discusses the possibility of �uninventing the bomb�, by which he means
changing society and technology in such a way that the atomic bomb becomes
an impossibility. Such change, he suggests, can be carried out in part
at the overt level of political organizations. However, and crucially for
our purposes, he also sensitizes the reader to the site of the development
and maintenance of technical standards as a site of political decisions
and struggle. Standards and classifications, however dry and formal on
the surfaces are suffused with traces of political and social work. Whether
we wish to uninvent any particular aspect of complex information infrastructure
is properly a political and a public issue. Because it has rarely been
cast in that light, tyrannies of various sorts flourish. Some are the tyrannies
of inertia � red tape � rather than explicit public policies. Others are
the quiet victories of infrastructure builders inscribing their politics
into the systems. Still other are almost accidental � systems that become
so complex that no one person and no organization can really predict or
administer good policy.
<p>The magic of modern technoscience is a lot of hard work, smoke-filled
rooms, and boring lists of numbers and settings. Tyranny or democracy,
its import on our lives cannot be denied. This chapter has offered a number
of points of departure for evaluation, resistance, and better analysis
of one of its least-understood aspects.

<p>In the following three chapters, which analyze the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) we shall look at the operation of classification systems
in supporting large-scale infrastructural arrangements. In Chapter 2 we
concentrate on the text of the ICD itself, producing a reading of this
classificationwhich has over the past century ingrained itself in a multiplicity
of
forms, work arrangements and laws worldwide. We examine how its internal
structure affords the prosecution of multiple agendas. In Chapter 3, we
will discuss the history of the ICD, showing how it has changed over time
in step with changing information technology and changing organizational
needs. In Chapter 4, we draw general design implications from the study
of this highly effective, long-term and wide-scale classification scheme.

<p>In the last three chapters we have looked at classification and wide-scale
coordination between multiple organizations. In the next two chapters,
we shall examine the relationship between classification and biography.
How do classification systems that intimately interpenetrate our lives
� shaping and being shaped by them � affect our experience? We shall look
in Chapter 5 at the intimate classification systems developed by sufferers
of tuberculosis and their doctors. So doing, we shall develop the themes
of trajectory (the movement through time of lives, diseases and institutions)
and torque (the twisting of that biography in the framework of a classification
system). In Chapter 6 we shall develop these themes further through an
analysis of race classification schemes in South Africa under apartheid.
Through this extreme example we shall explore how difficult it is to operate
a simple dichotomous classification scheme: and how the lives of those
caught in its interstices are torqued.

nursing work (NIC), we shall examine how classification systems which represent
work embody multiple tensions � notably in this case between control and
autonomy (Chapter 7) and the representation of current work practice and
learning from previous generations of practice (Chapter 8). Such tensions
are integral to the operation of work classifications. Due attention should
be paid to their occurrence in order to evaluate the political and ethical
implications of the introduction of new classificatory infrastructures.

<br>
<p>In this final part of the book, we attempt to weave the threads from
each of the chapters into a broader theoretical fabric. Throughout the
book we have demonstrated that categories are tied to the things that people
do; to the worlds to which they belong. In large-scale systems, those worlds
often come into conflict. The conflicts are resulted a variety of ways.
Sometimes boundary objects are created which allow for cooperation across
the borders. At other times, such as in the case of apartheid, voices are
stifled, and violence obtains.
<p>Chapter 9 discusses an abstract model of the several processes involved
in both the development of boundary objects, or any other alternatives.
The key concept in this chapter is multiplicity; the multiplicity both
of people's memberships, and of the ways in which objects are naturalized
simultaneously in more than one world. People become members of many communities
of practice. They do so it different rates, and with different degrees
of completeness. Some communities are all encompassing, others occupy very
little of one's life space. Some things in shared quite locally; others
become standardized across thousands of social worlds. While it is impossible,
and will always be impossible, fully to map the myriad of relationships
even a simple situation contains, it is possible to get at least a gestalt
sense of the issues involved.
<p>The chapter discusses the multiple trajectories of membership and naturalization.
It discusses the consequences of some memberships being silenced, ignored,
or devalued. It examines the notion of "cyborg," as a term for discussing
the relationships between memberships and the naturalization of objects.
The categorical exile of people and objects creates a monstrous landscape,
such as those seen in chapters 5 and 6.
<p>The chapter concludes with recognition of the language that people often
use in describing the complexities of people, things and their relationships.
We often turn to metaphors of texture to describe our sense we moral, emotional
and organizational feeling of these relationships. A situation can be knotty
and tangled; it can be handled smoothly and without ruffles. Following
Lakoff and Johnson (1980), we take these "metaphors we live by" as more
than poetic but imprecise means of expression. The metaphors are more systematic
and more telling than that. Indeed, they are a key to understanding and
perhaps to modeling some of the more complex phenomena facing us in what
Ina Wagner (personal communication) has called "the classification society."
<p>The book concludes with a discussion of the ways in which research on
classification and standards can inform a larger program of research into
the building and maintaining of infrastructure -- and its simultaneous
material/cultural nature.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Chapter Nine: Categorical Work and Boundary Infrastructures: Enriching
Theories of Classification</b>
<p>Where do categories come from? How do they span the boundaries of the
communities that use them? How can we see and analyze something so ubiquitous
and infrastructural -- something so "in between" a thing and an action?
These questions have been at the heart of much of social science over the
past one hundred years. Sociology and history are both concerned with relationships
-- which are invisible except through indicators such as the actions people
perform. One cannot directly <i>see</i> relations such as membership, learning,
ignoring or categorizing. They are names we give to patterns and indicators.
If someone is comfortable with the things and language used by a group
of others, we say that he or she is a member of that group. In this sense,
categories -- our own and those of others -- come from action, and in turn
from relationships. They are, as sociologists like Aaron Cicourel remind
us, continually re-made and refreshed, with a lot of skilled work (1964).
The cases in this book are framed in dialogue with an extensive literature
on language, group membership and classification.
<p>In this chapter, we make several aspects of that dialogue more explicit.
However, our goal here is much more modest than a thoroughgoing analysis
of categorization and language. We examine classification systems as historical
and political artifacts, very much as part of modern Western bureaucracy.
Assigning things, people or their actions to categories is a ubiquitous
part of work in the modern, bureaucratic state. Categories in this sense
arise from work and from other kinds of organized activity, including the
conflicts over meaning that occur when multiple groups fight over the nature
of a classification system and its categories.
<p>In this chapter, we pick up the theoretical strands of the cases in
this volume, to begin to develop a more general notion of classification
systems. So doing, we take a step bacnk and look at how the various kinds
of classifcation we have discussed knit together to form the texture of
a social space. We move from classifying and boundary objects to <i>categorical
work and boundary infrastructures</i>, weaving along the way the many strands
that our cases have presented. As we noted in Chapter 1, maintaining a
vision that allows us to see the relationships between people, things,
moral order, categories and standards is difficult. It requires a good
map and a working compass � which we shall try to provide below.
<p>The journey begins by clearing away some of the theoretical brush surrounding
the very notions of categories and classification. Many scholars have seen
categories as coming from an abstract sense of "mind," little anchored
in the exigencies of work or politics. The work of attaching things to
categories, and the ways in which those categories are ordered into systems,
is often overlooked (except by theorists of language such as Harvey Sacks,
1975; 1992).
<p>We present classification systems in modern organizations as tools that
are both material and symbolic. As information technologies used to communicate
across the boundaries of disparate communities, they have some unique properties.
Next, we present some basic propositions about large-scale information
systems. We examine how they are used to communicate across contexts. These
systems are always heterogeneous. Their ecology encompasses the formal
and the informal, and the arrangements that are made to meet the needs
of heterogeneous communities � some cooperative, and some coercive.
<p>The third part of the journey involves understanding two sets of relationships:
first, and analytically, between people and membership; and between things
and their naturalization by communities of practice.
<p>The fourth step moves away from the analytical device of single person-single
membership and single object � single naturalization, to describing a more
complex set of multiple relationships. Everyone is part of multiple communities
of practice. Things may be naturalized in more than one social world --
sometimes differently, sometimes in the same fashion. Both people�s memberships
and the naturalization of objects are multiple � and these processes are,
furthermore, intimately intertwined.
<p>The fifth part of the chapter introduces the idea of categorical work
� the work that people do to juggle both these multiple memberships and
the multiple naturalizations of objects. In this work is the genius of
what Sacks called "doing being ordinary" (1975) or what Strauss pointed
to in his "continual permutations of action" (1993). In the simplest-seeming
action, such as picking an article of clothing to wear, is embedded complex
knowledge of situations (Where will I go today? What should I look like
for the variety of activities in which I will participate?) involving multiple
memberships and how objects are used differently across communities (will
this shirt "do" for a meeting with the dean, lunch with a prospective lover,
and an appointment with the doctor at the end of the day?). Many of these
choices become standardized and built into the environment around us --
for example, the range of clothing we select is institutionalized by the
retail stores to which we have access, traditions of costuming, and so
forth. To think of this formally, the institutionalization of categorical
work across multiple communities of practice, over time, produces the structures
of our lives, from clothing to houses. The parts that are sunk into the
built environment we call here boundary infrastructures -- objects that
cross larger levels of scale than boundary objects.
<p>Finally, we conclude the chapter with a discussion of future directions
for research into classifications, standards and their complex relationships
with memberships in communities of practice. This includes ways we might
visualize and model these intricate relationships.
<p>The overall goal of the chapter is to trace theoretically what we have
shown empirically and methodologically throughout the volume: that categories
are historically situated artifacts, and like all artifacts, are learned
as part of membership in communities of practice. We want as well to talk
about this insight beyond the individual "mind, " task, or the small scale
-- classifications as technologies are powerful artifacts that may link
thousands of communities, and span highly complex boundaries.
<p><b>1. What sort of thing is a category?</b>
<p><i>In so far as the coding scheme establishes an orientation toward
the world, it constitutes a structure of intentionality whose proper locus
is not the isolated, Cartesian mind, but a much larger organizational system,
one that is characteristically mediated through mundane bureaucratic documents
such as forms.</i> (Goodwin, 1996: 65)
<p>Classification is a core topic within anthropology, especially cognitive
anthropology, and within computer science, as the quote from Goodwin attests.
Recently, as we discuss in Chapter 2, there has been a move to understand
the practical, work-related aspects of classification, as part of a larger
project of revisioning cognition (e.g. Suchman, 1988; Hutchins, 1996; Keller
and Keller, 1996; Lave, 1986).
<p><b>Revisioning Cognition</b>
<p>Within anthropology, psychology and the sociology of science, the last
two decades have seen a resurgence of the struggle to understand the material,
social and ecological aspects of cognition. The work in this book has been
deeply informed by that intellectual movement. In brief, the research in
this tradition seeks to ground activities previously seen as individual,
mental and non-social as situated, collective and historically specific.
On this view, for example, solving a mathematical problem is not a matter
of mentally using an algorithm and coming up with the correct answer, in
a fashion that exists outside of time or culture. Rather, it is a process
of assembling materials close to hand, and using them with others in specific
contexts. Jean Lave, for example, studied mathematical problem-solving
in everyday life, and contrasted it with formal testing situations (1986;
1988). She followed adults shopping for the best buy in a supermarket,
people in Weight Watchers weighing cottage cheese in order to get the correct
unit for the diet's specifications, and a variety of other mundane activities.
She observed people performing highly abstract, creative mathematical problem-solving
in these circumstances: creating new units of analysis transposed against
given ones in order to measure units, literally cutting up the cottage
cheese and moving these material units around, or holding one can against
another. These tasks were performed successfully by people who tested badly
in a traditional math test. There was, she argued, no way to separate the
material circumstances of the problem-solving from the mathematical challenges.
Those who seem to solve mathematics problems without such outside help
are not working in a putative realm of pure number. Rather, they and their
observers have so naturalized the structures within which they are operating
that they have become invisible. Lucy Suchman makes a similar argument
for the process of planning as material resource; Ed Hutchins for navigation
problems (1993); Janet and Charles Keller for designing and measuring in
doing iron blacksmithing work (1996). In this book, we join their effort
at reforming the notion of categorizing and classifying -- so often seen
as purely mental.
<p>The problem of conceptualizing classifications is also akin to Cole�s
(1996) search for the nature of artifacts in mediated action. Cole notes
that:
<dir>
<dir>An artifact is an aspect of the material world that has been modified
over the history of its incorporation into goal-directed human action.
By virtue of the changes wrought in the process of their creation and use,
artifacts are simultaneously <i>ideal </i>(conceptual) and <i>material.
</i>They
are ideal in that their material form has been shaped by their participation
in the interactions of which they were previously a part and which they
mediate in the present (Cole, 1996: 117).</dir>
</dir>
The materiality of categories, like that of other things associated with
the purely cognitive, has been difficult to analyze. The Janus-faced conceptual/material
notion of artifacts suggested by Cole, combined with the attention to the
use in practice of categories is a good way to begin. Classifications are
both conceptual (in the sense of persistent patterns of change and action,
resources for organizing abstractions) and material (in the sense of being
inscribed, transported, and affixed to stuff).
<p>Cole�s intent is to emphasize the conceptual and symbolic sides of things
often taken as only materials, tools and other artifacts. It is similarly
felicitous to emphasize the brute material force of that which has been
considered ideal, such as categories.
<p><b>1.1 The Pragmatist Turn</b>
<p>The most radical turn taken by Pragmatist philosophers such as Dewey
and Bentley, and closely followed by Chicago School sociologists such as
Thomas and Hughes, is perhaps the least understood. It is related, both
historically and conceptually, to the cognitive reforms detailed above.
Consequences, asserted Dewey against a rising tide of analytic philosophy,
are the thing to look at in any argument -- not ideal logical antecedents.
What matters about an argument is who, under what conditions, takes it
to be true. Carried over into sociology, W. I. And Dorothy Thomas used
it (as Howard Becker would some decades later) to argue against essentialism
in examining so-called deviants or problem children (Thomas and Thomas,
1917; Becker, 1964). If social scientist do not understand people�s definition
of a situation, they do not understand it at all. That definition -- whether
it is the label of deviant or the performance of a religious ritual --
is what people will shape their behavior towards.
<p>This is a much more profound cut on social construction than the mere
notion that people construct their own realities. It makes no comment on
where the definition of the situation may come from -- human or nonhuman,
structure or process, group or individual. It powerfully draws attention
to the fact that the materiality of anything (action, idea, definition,
hammer, gun or school grade) is drawn from the consequences of its situation.
<p>The Pragmatist turn, like the activity theoretical turn taken by Cole
and others, emphasizes the ways in which things perceived as real may mediate
action (Star, 1996). If someone is taken to be a witch, and elaborate technical
apparatus with which to diagnose her or him as such is developed, then
the reality of witchcraft obtains in the consequences -- perhaps death
at the stake. Classification systems are one form of technology, used in
the sense Cole employs, linked together in elaborate informatic systems
and enjoining deep consequences for those touched by them.
<p>The following section discusses the problems of scaling up, from boundary
objects and classifications systems on the one hand, to a notion of boundary
infrastructure. This draws together the notions of multiplicity and the
symbolic/material aspects of categories as artifacts discussed above.
<p><b>2. Information Systems across Contexts</b>
<p>At its most abstract, the design and use of information systems involves
linking experience gained in one time and place with that gained in another,
via representations of some sort. Even seemingly simple replication and
transmission of information from one place to another involves encoding
and decoding as time and place shift. Thus the context of information shifts
in spite of its continuities; and this shift in context imparts heterogeneity
to the information itself. Classifications are a very common sort of representation
used for this purpose. Formal classification systems are, in part, an attempt
to regularize the movement of information from one context to another;
to provide a means of access to information across time and space. The
ICD, for example, moves information across the globe, over decades, and
across multiple conflicting medical belief and practice systems.
<p>One of the interesting features of communication is that, broadly speaking,
in order to be perceived, information <i>must </i>reside in more than one
context. We know what something is by contrast with what it is not. Silence
makes musical notes perceivable; conversation is understood as a contrast
of contexts, speaker and hearer, words, breaks and breaths. In turn, in
order to be meaningful, these contexts of information must be <i>re-linked</i>
through some sort of judgment of equivalence or comparability. This occurs
at all levels of scale, and we all do it routinely as part of everyday
life.
<p>None of this is new in theories of information and communication: we
have long had models of signals and targets, background, noise and filters,
signals and quality controls. We are moving this insight to the level of
social interaction. That is, people often cannot see what they take for
granted until they encounter someone who does not take it for granted.
<p>A radical statement of this would be that information is only information
when there are <i>multiple</i> interpretations. One person�s noise may
be another�s signal, or two people may agree to attend to something --
but it is the tension between contexts that actually creates representation.
What becomes problematic under these circumstances is the relationships
between people and things, or objects, the relationships that create representations,
not just noise. The ecological approach we have taken in this volume adds
people as active interpreters of information, who themselves inhabit multiple
contexts of use and practice (Star 1991). This multiplicity is primary,
not accidental nor incidental.
<p>Consider, for example, the design of a computer system to support collaborative
writing. Eevi Beck (1995: 53) studied the evolution of one such system:
"how two authors, who were in different places, wrote an academic publication
together making use of computers. . .The work they were doing and the way
in which they did it was inseparable from their immediate environment and
the culture which it was part of". To make the whole system work, they
had to juggle time zones, spouses� schedules, and sensitivities about parts
of work practice such as finishing each other�s sentences <i>as well as</i>
manipulating the technical aspects of the writing software and hardware.
They had to build a shared context in which to make sense of the information.
Beck is arguing against a long tradition of de-contextualized design where
only the technical, or narrowly construed considerations about work hold
sway.
<p>We lack good relational language here. There is a permanent tension
between the formal and the empirical, the local/situated and attempts to
represent information across localities. It is this tension itself which
is under-explored and under-theorized. It is not just a set of interesting
metaphysical observations. It can also become a pragmatic unit of analysis.
How can something be simultaneously concrete and abstract? The same and
yet different? People are not (yet, we hope) used to thinking in this fashion
in science or technology. As information systems grow in scale and scope,
however, the need for such complex analyses grows as well. In opposition
to the old hierarchical databases, where relations between classes had
to be decided once for all at the time of original creation, many databases
today incorporate object-oriented views of data whereby different attributes
can be selected and combined on the fly for different purposes. The tailorability
of software applications similarly becomes very important for customizing
use in different settings (Trigg and B&oslash;dker, 1994).
<p>If we look at these activities in the context of practice, we see what
Suchman and Trigg (1993) call the �artful integration� of local constraints,
received standardized applications, and the re-representation of information.
The tension between locales remains. This tension it is not something to
be avoided or deleted. When the sort of "artful integration" discussed
by Suchman and Trigg becomes a) an ongoing, stable relationship between
different social worlds, and b) shared objects are built across community
boundaries, then boundary objects arise.
<p>Boundary objects are one way that the tension between divergent viewpoints
may be managed. There are of course many other ways. All of them involve
accommodations, workarounds, and in some sense, a higher level of artful
integration. It too is managed by people�s artful juggling, gestalt switching,
and on the spot translating.
<p>Too often, this sort of work remains invisible to traditional science
and technology, or to rational analyses of process. This tension is itself
collective, historical, and partially institutionalized. The medium of
an information system is not just wires and plugs, bits and bytes, but
also conventions of representation, information both formal and empirical.
A system becomes a system in design and use, not the one without the other.
The medium <i>is</i> the message, certainly, and it is also the case that
both are political creations (Taylor and Van Every, 1993). In Donna Haraway�s
words:
<dir>
<dir>No layer of the onion of practice that is technoscience is outside
the reach of technology of critical interpretation and critical inquiry
about positioning and location; that is the condition of embodiment and
mortality. The technical and the political are like the abstract and the
concrete, the foreground and the background, the text and the context,
the subject and the object. (Haraway, 1993: 10)</dir>
</dir>
A fully developed method of multiplicity/heterogeneity for information
systems must draw on many sources and make many unexpected alliances (Star
1989a: Chapter 1; Star 1989b; Hewitt 1986; Goguen 1997). If both people
and information objects inhabit multiple contexts, and a central goal of
information systems is to transmit information across contexts, then a
representation is a kind of pathway that includes everything populating
those contexts. This includes people, things/objects, previous representations,
and information about its own structure. The major requirements for such
an ecological understanding of the path of re-representation are thus:
<p>1. How objects can inhabit multiple contexts at once, and have both
local and shared meaning;
<p>2. How may people who live in one community, and draw their meanings
from people and objects situated there, communicate with those inhabiting
another?
<p>3. How relationships form between 1) and 2) above � that is, how can
we model the information ecology of people and things, across multiple
communities?
<p>4. What range of solutions to these three questions is possible, and
what moral and political consequences attend each of them -- <i>cui bono</i>?
<p>Standardization has been one of the common solutions to this class of
problems: if interfaces and formats are standard across contexts, then
at least the first three questions become clear, and the fourth seems to
become moot. But we know from a long and gory history of attempts to standardize
information systems that standards don�t remain standard for very long,
and that one person�s standard is another�s confusion and mess (Gasser,
1986; Star, 1991b). We need a richer vocabulary than that of standardization
or formalization with which to characterize the heterogeneity and the processual
nature of information ecologies.
<p><b>3. Boundary Objects and Communities of Practice</b>
<p>The class of questions posed by the slippage between classifications
and standards on the one hand, and the contingencies of practice on the
other, form core problematics in both sociology of science and in studies
of use and design in information science. A rich body of work has grown
up in both fields which documents the clever ways people organize and re-organize
when the local circumstances of their activities do not match the prescribed
categories or standards (see e.g. Gasser, 1986; Kling and Scacchi, 1982;
Lave, 1988; Sacks, 1975; Star, 1983). Making or using any kind of representation
is a complex accomplishment, a balance of improvisation and accommodation
to constraint.
<p>People learn how to do this everyday, impossible action as they become
members of what Lave and Wenger (1991) call <i>communities of practice</i>,
or what Strauss (1978) calls <i>social worlds</i>. A community of practice
(or social world) is a unit of analysis that cuts across formal organizations,
institutions like family and church, and other forms of association such
as social movements. It is, put simply, a set of relations between people
doing things together (Becker, 1986). The activities, with their stuff,
their routines and exceptions, are what constitute the community structure.
Newcomers to the community learn by becoming "sort of" members, what Lave
and Wenger (1991) call the process of �legitimate peripheral participation.�
They have investigated how this membership process unfolds, and how it
is constitutive of learning.
<p>We are all in this sense members of various social worlds � communities
of practice -- that conduct activities together. Membership in such groups
is a complex process, varying in speed and ease, with how optional it is,
and how permanent it may be. One is not born a violinist, as we all know,
but gradually becomes a member of the violin-playing community of practice
through a long period of lessons, shared conversations, technical exercises,
and participation in a range of other related activities.
<p>People live, with respect to a community of practice, along a trajectory
(or continuum) of membership, which has elements of both ambiguity and
duration. They may move from <i>legitimate peripheral participation</i>
to full membership in the community of practice, and it is extremely useful
in many ways to conceive of learning this way.
<p><b>How does this include categories?</b>
<p>Learning the ropes and rules of practice in any given community entails
a series of encounters with the objects involved in the practice: tools,
furniture, texts, and symbols, among others. It also means managing encounters
with other people, and with classes of action. Membership in a community
of practice has as its <i>sine qua non</i> an increasing familiarity with
the categories that apply to all of these. As the familiarity deepens,
so does one�s perception of the object as strange or of the category itself
as something new and different. Anthropologists call this the <i>naturalization</i>
of categories or objects. The more at home you are in a community of practice,
the more you forget the strange and contingent nature of its categories
seen from the outside.
<p>Illegitimacy, then, is seeing those objects as would a stranger -- either
as a na&iuml;f or by comparison with another frame of reference in which
they exist. And this is not to be equated with an idealized notion of skill,
but with membership. One does not have to be Isaac Stern to know fully
and naturally what to do with a violin, where it belongs, and how to act
around violins and violinists. But if you use a Stradivarius to swat a
fly (but not as part of an artistic Futurist event!) you have clearly defined
yourself as an outsider, in a way that a schoolchild practicing scales
has not.
<p>Membership can thus be described individually as the <i>experience</i>
of encountering objects, and increasingly being in a naturalized relationship
with them. (Think of the experience of being at home, and how one settles
down and relaxes when surrounded by utterly familiar objects; think of
how demented one feels in the process of moving house.)
<p>From the point of view of learning-as-membership and participation,
then, the illegitimate stranger is a source of learning. Someone�s illegitimacy
appears as a series of interruptions to experience (Dewey 1916; Dewey 1929),
or a lack of a naturalization trajectory. In a way, then, individual membership
processes are about the resolution of interruptions (anomalies) posed by
the tension between the ambiguous (outsider, naive, strange) and the naturalized
(at home, taken-for-granted) categories for objects. <i>Collectively, </i>membership
can be described as the processes of managing the tension between naturalized
categories on the one hand, and the degree of openness to immigration on
the other. Harvey Sacks, in his extensive investigations into language
and social life, notes that categories of membership form the basis of
many of our judgments about ordinary action. "You can easily enough come
to see that for any population of persons present there are available alternative
sets of categories that can be used on them. That then poses for us an
utterly central task in our descriptions; to have some way of providing
which set of categories operate in some scene -- in the reporting of that
scene or in its treatment as it is occurring" (1991a: 116). Sacks draws
attention to the ways in which being ordinary are not pre-given but are
in fact a kind of job -- a job which asserts the nature of membership:
<dir>
<dir>Whatever we may think about what it is to be an ordinary person in
the world, an initial shift is not to think of an "ordinary person" as
some person, but as somebody having as their job, as their constant preoccupation,
doing "being ordinary." It's not that somebody <i>is </i>ordinary, it's
perhaps that that's what their business is. And it takes work, as any other
business does. And if you just extend the analogy of what you obviously
think of as work -- as whatever it is that takes analytic, intellectual,
emotional energy -- then you can come to see that all sorts of normalized
things -- personal characteristics and the like -- are jobs which are done,
which took some kind of effort, training, etc.. So I'm not going to be
talking about to an "ordinary person" as this or that person, or as some
average, i.e., a non--exceptional person on some statistical basis, but
as something that is the way somebody constitutes themselves, and, in effect,
a job that they do on themselves. Fate and the people around and may be
coordinatively engaged in assuring that each of them are ordinary persons,
and that can then be a job that they undertake together, to achieve that
each of them, together, are ordinary persons (1992b: 216)</dir>
</dir>
The performance of this job includes the ability to choose the proper categories
under which to operate, to perform this ordinariness. The power of Sack's
work, like that of John Dewey (e.g., 1929), is that he draws attention
to the ways in which the ordinary -- and the interruption to the expected
experience -- are delicate constructions, made and re-made every day.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>3.1 Boundary Objects</b>
<p>Science and technology are good places to study the rich mix of people
and things brought to bear on complex problem solving questions, although
the
points made here are more generally applicable as well. Categories and
their boundaries are centrally important in science, and scientists are
especially good at documenting and publicly arguing about the boundaries
of categories. Thus, in turn, science is a good place to understand more
about membership in communities. This point of departure has led us to
try to understand people and things ecologically, both with respect to
membership and with respect to the things they live with, with a focus
on scientists (Star, 1995a). One of the observations is that scientists
routinely cooperate across many communities of practice. They thus bring
different naturalized categories with them into the partnerships.
<p>In studying scientific problem solving, we have been concerned for a
number of years to understand how scientists <i>could</i> cooperate without
agreeing about the classification of objects or actions. Scientific work
is always composed of members of different communities of practice (we
know of no science that is not interdisciplinary in this way, especially
if - as we do - you include laboratory technicians and janitors). Thus,
memberships (and divergent viewpoints, or perspectives) present a pressing
problem for modeling truth, the putative job of scientists. In developing
models for this work, Star coined the term �boundary objects� to talk about
how scientists balance different categories and meanings (Star and Griesemer,
1989; Star, 1989b). Again, the term is not exclusive to science, but science
is an interesting place to study such objects because the push to make
problem-solving explicit gives one an unusually detailed amount of information
about the arrangements.
<p>Boundary objects are those objects that both inhabit several communities
of practice and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them.
Boundary objects are thus both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and
constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to
maintain a common identity across sites. They are weakly structured in
common use, and become strongly structured in individual-site use. These
objects may be abstract or concrete. Star and Griesemer (1989) first noticed
the phenomenon in studying a museum, where the specimens of dead birds
had very different meanings to amateur bird-watchers and professional biologists,
but "the same" bird was used by each group. Such objects have different
meanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough
to more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of translation.
The creation and management of boundary objects is a key process in developing
and maintaining coherence across intersecting communities.
<p>Another way of talking about boundary objects is to consider them with
respect to the processes of naturalization and categorization we discussed
above. Boundary objects arise over time from durable cooperation between
communities of practice. They are working arrangements that resolve anomalies
of naturalization without imposing a naturalization of categories from
one community or from an outside source of standardization. (They are therefore
most useful in analyzing cooperative and relatively equal situations; issues
of imperialist imposition of standards, force and deception have a somewhat
different structure.) In terms of this book, sets of boundary objects arise
directly from the problematics created when two or more differently naturalized
classification systems collide. Thus nursing administrators create classification
systems which serve hospital administrators and nursing scientists; soil
scientists create classifications of soil to satisfy geologists and botanists
(Chatelin, 1979). Other outcomes of these meetings are explored as well
� the dominance of one over another; how claims of authority may be manipulated
to higher claims of naturalness.
<p>The processes by which communities of practice manage divergent and
conflicting classification systems are complex, the more so as people are
all members in fact of many communities of practice, with varying levels
of commitment and consequence. Under those conditions, how are boundary
objects established and maintained? Does the concept scale up? What is
the role of technical infrastructure? Is a standard ever a boundary object?
How do classification systems, as artifacts, play a role?
<p><b>4. Membership and Naturalization: People and Things</b>
<p>As Engestr&ouml;m (1990b) and other activity theorists note so well,
tools and material arrangements always mediate activity. People never act
in a vacuum or some sort of hypothetical pure universe of doing, but always
with respect to arrangements, tools, and material objects. Strauss has
recently made a similar point, emphasizing the continuity and permeability
of such arrangements -- action never really starts from scratch, from a
tabula rasa (1993). Both Engestr&ouml;m and Strauss go to great lengths
to demonstrate that an idea, or something that has been learned, can also
be considered as having material/objective force in its consequences and
mediations.
<p>"Object" includes all of this: stuff and things, tools, artifacts and
techniques, and ideas, stories, and memories -- those objects which are
treated as consequential by community members (Clarke and Fujimura 1992a;
1992b). They are used in the service of an action, and mediate it in some
way. Something actually <i>becomes </i>an object only in the context of
action and use -- it then becomes as well something that has force to mediate
subsequent action. It is easier to see this from historical examples than
it may be to look to contemporary ones. For instance, the category of hysteria
was naturalized in medicine and in popular culture at the end of the 19th-century.
As with the example of witchcraft discussed above, people used the diagnosis
of hysteria for purposes of social control as well as for medical treatment.
It became a category through which physicians, social theorists, and novelists
discussed pain and anxiety and, arguably, the changing social status of
women. The point is not who believed what when, but rather that the category
itself became an object existing in both communities. It was a medium of
communication, whatever else it may also have been.
<p>A community of practice is defined in large part according to the co-use
of such objects, since all practice is so mediated. The relationship of
the newcomer to the community largely revolves around the nature of the
relationship with the objects -- and not, counterintuitively, directly
with the people. As noted above with respect to action, this sort of directness
only exists hypothetically -- there is always mediation by some sort of
object. Acceptance or legitimacy derives from the familiarity of action
mediated by member objects.
<p>But familiarity is a fairly sloppy word. We mean it here not instrumentally,
as in proficiency, but relationally, as a measure of taken-for-grantedness.
(An inept programmer can still be a member of the community of practice
of computer specialists, albeit a low status one in that she takes for
granted the objects to be used.) A better way to describe the trajectory
of an object in a community is as one of <i>naturalization.</i> Naturalization
means stripping away the contingencies of an object�s creation and its
situated nature. A naturalized object has lost its anthropological strangeness.
It is in that narrow sense de-situated -- members have forgotten the local
nature of the object�s meaning, or the actions that go into maintaining
and recreating its meaning We no longer think much about the miracle of
plugging a light into a socket and obtaining illumination, and must make
an effort of anthropological imagination to remind ourselves of contexts
in which it is still not naturalized.
<p>Objects become natural in a particular community of practice over a
long period of time (see Latour�s (1987) arguments in <i>Science in Action</i>
for a good discussion of this). Objects exist, with respect to a community,
along a trajectory of naturalization. This trajectory has elements of both
ambiguity and duration. It is not pre-determined whether an object will
ever become naturalized, or how long it will remain so -- rather, practice/activity
is required to make it so and keep it so. The more naturalized an object
becomes, the more unquestioning the relationship of the community to it;
the more invisible the contingent and historical circumstances of its birth;
the more it sinks into the community�s routinely forgotten memory. Light
switches, for instance, are ordinary parts of modern life. Almost all people
living in the industrialized world know about light bulbs and electricity,
even if they live without it, and switches and plugs are naturalized objects
in most communities of practice. People don�t think twice about their nature,
only about whether or not they can find them when needed.
<p>Commodity and infrastructure technologies are often naturalized in this
way. In a sense, they become a form of collective forgetting, or naturalization,
of the contingent, messy work they replace. We wrote this chapter on Macintosh
and IBM computers; cutting and pasting with it are no longer phenomenologically
novel operations, although we can remember when they once were. We have
naturalized the mouse, the operation of selecting text, and the anachronistic
"cut and paste" metaphor.
<p><b>Multiplicity</b>
<p>In this chapter so far, there are, then<font face="Arial">, </font>analytically
two sets of relationships: between people and membership, on the one hand;
and objects and naturalization on the other hand. In any given instance,
<i>both
membership and naturalization are relations along a trajectory</i>. In
saying this, we do not want to re-create a great divide between people
and objects, reifying an objectless human or wild child. Ironically in
a way, social science has spent incredible resources on precisely this
sort of search. There is something compelling about the idea of a person
without "a society," naked even of touch or language. The sad case of "Genie,"
a child kept captive by her parents for many years (Rymer, 1993; Star,
1995d), or the "wild child of Aveyron" which amazed 18<sup>th</sup> century
philosophers, are emblematic of this propensity. They have been seen as
holding the key to language, or in a way to what it is to be human.
<p>However, exactly the opposite is true. People-and-things, which are
the same as people-and-society, cannot be separated in any meaningful practical
sense. At the same time, it is possible for analytical purposes to think
of two trajectories travelling in tandem, membership and naturalization.
Just as it is not practically possible to separate a disease from a sick
patient, yet it is possible to speak of the trajectories of disease and
biography operating and pulling at one another, as we have done in Chapter
5, in the case of tuberculosis.
<p><b>Residual categories, marginal people, and monsters</b>
<p>People often seen multiplicity and heterogeneity as accidents or exceptions.
The marginal person, who is for example of mixed race, is portrayed as
the troubled outsider; just as the thing that doesn�t fit into one bin
or another gets put into a "residual" category. This habit of purity has
old and complicated origins in western scientific and political culture
(e.g. as explicated by Dewey, 1916). The habit perpetuates a cruel pluralistic
ignorance. No one is pure. No one is even average. And all things inhabit
someone�s residual category in some category system. The myriad of classifications
and standards that surround and support the modern world, however, often
blind people to the importance of the "other" category as constitutive
of the whole social architecture (Derrida, 1980).
<p>Communities vary in their tastes for openness, and in their tolerance
for this ambiguity. Cults, for example, are one sort of collective which
is low on the openness dimension and correspondingly high on the naturalization/positivism
dimension -- us <i>vs.</i> them.
<p>In recent years social theorists have been working toward enriching
an understanding of multiplicity and misfit, and decentering the idea of
an unproblematic mainstream. The schools of thought grappling with this
include feminist research (e.g. Haraway, 1997), multi-cultural or race-critical
theory (e.g. Ferguson, et al., 1990), symbolic interactionism, and activity
theory (e.g., Cole, 1996; Wertsch, 1991; 1998). During the same period,
such issues have become increasingly of concern to some information scientists.
As the information systems of the world expand and flow into each other,
and more kinds of people use them for more different things, it becomes
harder to hold to pure or universal ideas about representation or information.
<p>Some of these problems are taken up in the intellectual common territory
sometimes called cyborg. Cyborg, as used for example by Donna Haraway (1991)
and Adele Clarke (1993; 1998), means the intermingling of people, things
(including information technologies), representations and politics in a
way that challenges both the romance of essentialism and the hype about
what is technologically possible. It acknowledges the interdependence of
people and things, and just how blurry the boundaries between them have
become. The notion cyborg has clearly touched a nerve across a broad spectrum
of intellectual endeavors. The American Anthropological Association has
hosted sessions on cyborg anthropology for the past several years; the
weighty <i>Cyborg Handbook</i> was published a few years ago (Gray, 1995).
<p>Through looking at ubiquitous classification systems and standards,
it is possible to move towards an understanding of the stuff that makes
up the networks that shape much of modern daily life in cyborg fashion.
We draw attention here to the places where the work gets done of assuring
that these networks will stick together: to the places where human and
non-human are constructed to be operationally and analytically equivalent.
So doing, we explore the political and ethical dimensions of classification
theory.
<p>Why should computer scientists read African-American poets? What does
information science have to do with race critical or feminist methods and
metaphysics? The collective wisdom in those domains is one of the richest
places for which to understand these core problems in information systems
design: how to preserve the integrity of information without <i>a priori
</i>standardization
and its often-attendant violence. In turn, if those lessons can be taken
seriously within the emerging cyber world, there may yet be a chance to
strengthen its democratic ethical aspects. It is easy to be ethnocentric
in virtual space; more difficult to avoid stereotypes. The lessons of those
who have lived with such stereotypes are important, perhaps now more than
ever.
<p><b>Borderlands and Monsters</b>
<p>People who belong to more than one central community are also important
sources for understanding more about the links between moral order and
categorization. Such "marginal" people have long been interest to social
scientists and novelists alike. Marginality as a technical term in sociology
refers to human membership in more than one community of practice; here
we are emphasizing those people who belong to communities that are different
in key, life-absorbing ways, such as racial groups (as per our discussion
in Chapter 6). A good example of a marginal person is someone who belongs
to more than one race, i.e. half white and half Asian. Again, we are not
using marginality here in the sense of center/margin or center/periphery
(e.g., not �in the margins�), but rather in the old-fashioned sense of
Robert Park�s marginal man, the one who has a double vision by virtue of
having more than one identity to negotiate (Park 1952; Stonequist 1937;
Simmel 1950 {1908}; Sch&uuml;tz, 1944). Strangers are those who come and
stay a while, long enough so that membership becomes a troublesome issue
-- they are not just nomads passing through, but people who sort of belong
and sort of don�t.
<p>Marginality is an interesting paradoxical concept for people and things.
On the one hand, membership means the naturalization of objects, which
mediate action. On the other, everyone is a member of multiple communities
of practice. Yet since different communities generally have differently
naturalized objects in their ecology, how can someone maintain multiple
membership without becoming simply schizophrenic? How can they naturalize
the same object differently, since naturalization by definition demands
forgetting about other worlds?
<p>There are as well some well-known processes in social psychology for
managing these tensions and conflicts: passing, or making one community
the shadow for the other; splitting, or having some form of multiple personality/chameleon;
fragmenting or segmenting the self into compartments; becoming a nomad,
intellectually and spiritually if not geographically (Larsen (1986) covers
many of these issues in her exquisite fiction).
<p>One dissatisfaction we have with these descriptions is that they all
paint each community of practice as ethnocentric, as endlessly hungry and
unwilling collectively to accommodate internal contradictions. There is
also an implicit idea of a sort of imperialist &uuml;ber-social world (the
mainstream) that is pressing processes of assimilation on the individual
(e.g. Americanization processes in the early 20th century). Communities
vary along this dimension of open/closedness, and it is equally important
to find successful examples of the nurturing of marginality (although it
is possible that by definition they exist anarchically and not institutionally/bureaucratically).
Here again, feminism has some important lessons. An important theme in
recent feminist theory is resistance to such imperializing rhetoric and
the development of alternative visions of coherence without unconscious
assumption of privilege. Much of it emphasizes a kind of double-vision,
such as that taken up in the notion of borderlands by Anzald&uacute;a (1987),
or the qualities of partiality and modesty of Haraway�s cyborg (1991).
<p>Charlotte Linde�s book on the processes of coherence in someone�s life
stories also provides some important clues. She especially emphasizes accidents
and contingency in the weaving together of a coherent narrative (Linde
1993). The narratives she analyses are in one sense meant to reconcile
the heterogeneity of multiply naturalized object relations in the person,
where the objects in question are stories/depictions of life events. Linden
(1993) and Strauss (1959) have made similar arguments about the uncertainty,
plasticity, and collectivity of life narratives.
<p>In traditional sociology this model might have overtones of functionalism,
in its emphasis on insiders/outsiders and their relations. But functionalists
never considered the nature of objects or of multiple legitimate memberships.
If we think in terms of a complex cluster of <i>multiple </i>trajectories
<i>simultaneously</i>
of both memberships and naturalizations, it is possible to think of a many-to-many
relational mapping.
<p>The mapping suggested here pushes us further into the analysis of the
cyborg. On the one hand, cyborgs as an image are somehow grotesque. Imagining
the relationships between people and things such that they are truly inter-penetrated
means rethinking human nature itself. It is reminiscent somehow of bad
science fiction. Yet analytically, it is a crucial notion for understanding
technoscience, and classifications as artifacts.
<p>How can we think of cyborgs in terms of the analysis presented in this
chapter? The mapping between things, people, and membership provides a
way in. Anzald&uacute;a's work on borderlands rejects any notion of purity
based on membership in a single, pristine racial, sexual, or even religious
group (1987). Haraway's work pushes this analysis a bit further. In speaking
of borderlands, both those concerning race and those concerning the boundaries
between humans and things, she employs the term "monsters."
<p>A monster occurs when an object refuses to be naturalized (Haraway 1992);
a borderland occurs when two communities of practice coexist in one person
(Anzald&uacute;a 1987). Borderlands are the naturalized home of those monsters
known as cyborgs.
<p>If we read monsters as persistent resisters of transparency/naturalization
within some community of practice, then the experience of encountering
an anomaly (such as that routinely encountered by a newcomer to science,
for instance a woman or man of color) may be keyed back into membership.
A person realizes that they don�t belong when what seems like an anomaly
to them seems natural for everyone else. Over time, collectively, such
outsider experiences (the quintessential stranger) can become monstrous
in the collective imagination. History and literature are full of the demonizing
of the stranger. Here is what Haraway (1992) has called �the promise of
monsters� and one of the reasons that for years they have captured the
feminist imagination. Frankenstein peering in the warmly-lit living room
window; Godzilla captured and shaking the bars of his cage are intuitions
of exile and madness, and symbols of how women�s resistance and wildness
has been imprisoned and reviled, kept just outside.
<p>In a more formal sense, monsters and freaks are also ways of speaking
about the constraints of the classifying and (often) dichotomizing imagination.
Ritvo (1997) writes of the proliferation of monsters in the 18<sup>th</sup>
and 19<sup>th</sup> century, linking it to a simultaneous increase in public
awareness of scientific classification and hunger for the exotic. As classification
schemes proliferated, so did monsters:
<dir>
<dir>Monsters were understood, in the first instance, as exceptions to
or violations of natural law. The deviations that characterized monsters,
however, were both so various and in some cases, so subtle as significantly
to complicate this stock account�. As a group, therefore, monsters were
united not so much by physical deformity or eccentricity as by their common
inability to fit or be fitted into the category of the ordinary � a category
that was particularly liable to cultural and moral construction (Ritvo,
1997: 133-134).</dir>
</dir>
In a practical sense, this is a way to talk about what happens to any outsider.
For example, it could refer to experience in the science classroom when
someone comes in with no experience of formal science, or to the transgendered
person who does not fit cultural gender dichotomies (Stone, 1991). It is
not simply a matter of the strangeness, but of the politics of the <i>mapping</i>
between the anomalies and the forms of strangeness/marginality.
<p>In accepting and understanding the monsters and the borderlands there
may be an intuition of healing and power, as Gloria Anzald&uacute;a (1987)
shows us in her brilliant and compassionate writing. In her essay, "La
conscientia de la mestiza," the doubleness and the ambiguity of the male/female,
straight/gay, Mexican/American borderland becomes the cauldron for a creative
approach to surviving, a rejection of simplistic purity and of essentialist
categories (1987). At the same time, she constantly remembers the physical
and political suffering involved in these borderlands, refusing a romanticized
version of marginality that often plagued the early sociological writers
on the topic.
<p>The path traced by Anzald&uacute;a is not an easy healing and certainly
not a magic bullet, but a complex and collective twisted journey, a challenge
to easy categories and simple solutions. It is, in fact, a politics of
ambiguity and multiplicity -- this is the real possibility of the cyborg.
For scholars, this is necessarily an exploration that exists in interdisciplinary
borderlands and crosses the traditional divisions between people, things,
and technologies of representation.
<p><b>Engineered vs. Organic Boundary Objects</b>
<p>Would be possible actually to design boundary objects? To engineer them
in the service of creating a better society? On the surface, this idea
is tempting. In some sense, this has been the goal of progressive education,
multiculturalism in the universities, and, the goal of the design of information
systems that may be accessed by people with very different points of view.
<p>Most schools now are lousy places to grow boundary objects, because
they both strip away the ambiguity of the objects of learning, and impose
or ignore membership categories (except artificial hierarchically assigned
ones). In mass schooling and standardized testing, an attempt is made to
insist on an engineered community of practice, where the practices are
dictated, and the naturalization process is monitored and regulated while
ignoring borderlands. They are virtual factories for monsters. In the 1970s
and 1980s many attempts were made to <i>include</i> other communities in
the formula via affirmative action and multicultural initiatives. But where
these lacked the relational base between borderlands and the naturalization
of objects, they ran aground on the idea of measuring progress in learning.
This is partly a political problem and partly a representational one. As
feminists learned so painfully over the years, a politics of identity based
on essences can only perpetuate vicious dualisms. That is, if one as a
white male science teacher were to bring in an African American woman as
a (Platonic) representative of African American-ness and/or woman-ness,
then attempt to match her essential identity to the objects in the science
classroom (without attending much to how they are fully naturalized objects
in <i>another</i> community of practice), costly and painful mismatches
are inevitable. The teacher risks causing serious damage to her self-articulation
(especially where she is alone), and her ability to survive (a look at
the dismal retention statistics of women and minority men in many sciences
and branches of engineering will underscore this point). Any mismatch becomes
her personal failure, since the measurement yardstick remains unchanged
although the membership criteria seem to have been stretched. Again, both
borderlands and anomalous objects have been deleted. Kal Alston (1993),
writing of her experience as an African-American Jewish feminist, has referred
to herself as a unicorn -- a being at once mythical and unknowable, straddling
multiple worlds.
<p>But <i>all</i> people belong to multiple communities of practice --
it�s just that in the case of the African-American woman in science, the
visibility and pressure is higher, and her experience is especially dense
in the skill of surviving multiplicity. Thus Patricia Hill Collins� title,
"Learning from the Outsider Within" has many layers and many directions
to be explored as we all struggle for rich ways of mapping that honors
this experience and survival (1986). Karla Danette Scott (1995) has recently
written about the interwoven languages of Black women coming to university,
and how language becomes a resource for this lived complexity. They �talk
black� and �talk white� in a seamless, context-driven web, articulating
the tensions between those worlds as a collective identity. This is not
just code switching, but braided identity, a borderland.
<p><b>Wildness</b>
<p>Things and people are always multiple, although that multiplicity may
be obfuscated by standardized inscriptions. In this sense, with the right
angle of vision, things can be seen as heralds of other worlds, and of
a wildness that can offset our naturalizations in liberatory ways. Holding
firmly to a relational vision of people-things-technologies, in an ethical
political framework, there is a chance to step off the infinite regress
of measuring the consumption of an object naturalized in one centered world,
such as the objects of Western science, against an infinitely-expanded
set of essentially-defined members as consumers.
<p>By relational here we argue against misplaced concretism, or a scramble
unthinkingly to assimilate the experiences of things to pre-given categories.
We affirm the importance of process and ethical orientations. We also mean
to take seriously the power of membership, its continual nature (i.e. we
are never <i>not</i> members of some community of practice), and the inherent
ambiguity of things. Boundary objects, however, are not just about this
ambiguity, they are not just temporary solutions to disagreements about
anomalies. Rather, they are durable arrangements between communities of
practice. Boundary objects are the canonical forms of all objects in our
built and natural environments. Forgetting this, as people routinely do,
means empowering the self-proclaimed objective voice of purity that creates
the suffering of monsters in borderlands. Due attention to boundary objects
entails embracing the gentle and generous vision of <i>mestiza</i> consciousness
offered by Anzald&uacute;a.
<p><b>Casual vs. Committed Membership</b>
<p>Another dimension to take into account here is the degree to which membership
demands articulation at the higher level. Being a woman and African American
and disabled are three sorts of membership that are non-optional, diffused
throughout life, and embedded in almost every sort of practice and interaction.
So it�s not equitable to talk about being a woman in the same breath as
being a scuba diver -- although there are ways in which both can be seen
under the rubric community of practice. But if we go to the framework presented
above, there is a way to talk about it. To the extent that the joint objects
are both multiply naturalized in conflicting ways and diffused through
practices that belong to many communities they will pose a sticking point
that defies casual treatment. So for scuba diving -- it is primarily naturalized
in a leisure world, and not especially central to any others. Its practice
is restricted and membership is contained, neither contagious nor diffuse.
On the other hand, learning mathematics is multiply naturalized across
several powerful communities of practice (mathematics and science teachers
and practitioners); at the same time it is both strange and central to
others (central in the sense of a barrier to further progress). It is also
diffused through many kinds of practices, in various classrooms, disciplines
and workplaces (Hall and Stevens, 1995). Some communities of practice expect
it to be fully naturalized -- a background tool or a substrate/infrastructure
-- in order to get on with the business of being, e.g. a scientist. (Lave
1988). However, there is no map or sense of the strangeness of the object
across other memberships. Here, too, information technologies are both
diffused and strange, with rising expectations of literacy across worlds.
<p>These relations define a space against which and into which information
technologies of all sorts enter. These technologies of representation are
entering into all sorts of communities of practice on a global scale, in
design and in use. They are a medium of communication and broadcast, as
well as of standardization. The toughest problems in information systems
design are increasingly those concerned with modeling cooperation across
heterogeneous worlds, of modeling articulation work and multiplicity. If
we do not learn to do so, we face the risk of a franchised, dully standardized
infrastructure (�500 channels and nothing on,� in Mitch Kapur�s words),
or of an Orwellian nightmare of surveillance.
<p>Feminism and race-critical theory offer traditions of reflective denaturalization,
of a politics of simultaneity and contradiction intuited by the term cyborg.
Long ago feminists began with the maxim that the personal is political,
and that each woman�s experience has a primacy that we must all learn to
afford. Feminism went from reductionist identity politics to cyborg politics
in less than twenty years. Much of this was due to the hard work and suffering
of communities of practice who had been made monstrous or invisible, especially
women of color and their articulation of the layered politics of insider/outsider
and borderlands. One part of the methodological lesson from feminism read
in this way is that experience/experiment incorporates an ethics of ambiguity,
with both modesty and anger. This means that how we hear each other is
a matter of listening forth from silence -- listening is active, not passive;
it means stretching to affiliate with multiplicity.<b> </b>In Nell Morton�s
words, this is "hearing to speech":
<ul>
<li>
Not only a new speech but a new hearing.</li>

<li>
Hearing to speech is political</li>

<li>
Hearing to speech is never one-sided. Once a person is heard to speech
she becomes a hearing person.</li>

<li>
Speaking first to be heard is power over. Hearing to bring forth speech
is empowering. (Morton, 1985: 210).</li>
</ul>
Part of the moral vision of this book concerns how we may, through challenge
and analysis of infrastructure, better hear each other to speech.
<p><b>5. Multiple Marginality, Multiple Naturalizations: Categorical Work</b>
<p>The model proposed here takes the form of a many-to-many relational
mapping, between multiple marginality of people (borderlands and monsters)
and multiple naturalizations of objects (boundary objects and standards).
Over time, the mapping is between the means by which individuals and collectives
have managed the work of creating coherent selves in the borderlands on
the one hand, and to create durable boundary objects on the other.
<p>It is also not just many-to-many relational, but meta-relational. By
this we mean that the map must point simultaneously to the articulation
of selves and the naturalization of objects. One of the things that is
important here is honoring (we won�t say capturing) the work involved in
borderlands and boundary objects. This work is almost necessarily invisible
from the point of view of any single community of practice: as Collins
(1986) asks, what white really <i>sees</i> the work of self-articulation
of the black who is juggling multiple demands/audiences/contingencies?
It is not just willful blindness (although it can be that), but much more
akin to the blindness between different Kuhnian paradigms, a revolutionary
difference. Yet the juggling is both tremendously costly and brilliantly
artful. Every community of practice has its overhead: <i>paying your dues,
being regular, hangin�, being cool, being professional, people like us</i>,
<i>conduct
becoming</i>, <i>getting it, catching on</i> ... . And the more communities
of practice one participates in, the higher the overhead -- not just in
a straightforwardly additive sense, but interactively. Triple jeopardy
(i.e. being old, Black, and female) is not just three demographic variables
or conditions added together, but a tremendously challenging situation
of marginality requiring genius for survival. <i>The overheads interact.</i>
<p><b>From Articulation Work to Categorical Work</b>
<p>What is the name for this work of managing the overheads and anomalies
caused by multiple memberships on the one hand, and multiply naturalized
objects on the other? Certainly, it is invisible. Most certainly, it is
methodological, in the sense of reflecting on differences between methods
and techniques. At first glance, it resembles articulation work, that is,
work done in real time to manage contingencies; work that gets things back
on track in the face of the unexpected, that modifies action to accommodate
unanticipated contingencies. Within both symbolic interactionism and the
field of computer-supported cooperative work, the term articulation work
has been used to talk about some forms of this invisible juggling work
(Schmidt and Bannon 1992; Gerson and Star 1986).
<p>Articulation work is richly found for instance in the work of head nurses,
secretaries, homeless people, parents, and air traffic controllers, although
of course all of us do articulation work in order to keep our work going.
Modeling articulation work is one of the key challenges in the design of
cooperative and complex computers and information systems. This is because
real time contingencies, or in Suchman�s (1987) terms, situated actions,
always change the use of any technology (for example, when the host of
a talk forgets to order a computer projector, can one quickly print out
and assemble a handout?)
<p>Other aspects of cooperative work concerns novelty and the ways in which
one person�s routine may be another�s emergency or anomaly (Hughes, 1970),
or in the words of Schmidt and Simone (1996), both the consequences and
the division of labor of cooperative work. The act of cooperation is the
interleaving of distributed tasks; articulation work manages the <i>consequences</i>
of this distributed aspect of the work. Schmidt and Simone note the highly
complex dynamic and recursive relationship between the two -- managing
articulation work can itself become articulation work, and vice versa,
ad infinitum.
<p>The consequences of the distribution of work, and its different meanings
in different communities, must be managed for cooperation to occur. The
juggling of meanings (memberships and naturalizations), is what we term
<i>categorical
work</i>. For example, what happens when one clerk, User A, entering data
into a large database does not think of abortion as a medical matter, but
as a crime; while another, User B, thinks of it as a routine medical procedure?
Person A�s definition excludes abortion from the medical database, Person
B�s includes it. The resulting data will be, at the least, incomparable,
but in ways that may be completely invisible to User C, compiling statistics
for a court case arguing for the legalization of abortion based on prevalence.
When this aspect of the coordination of work is deleted and made invisible
in this fashion, then voices are suppressed and we see the formation of
master narratives and the myth of the mainstream universal (Star and Strauss,
1999).
<p>Thus, we can see categorical work as partly about managing the mismatches
between memberships and naturalization. One way to think about this is
through the management of anomalies -- as a tracer. Anomalies or interruptions,
the cause of contingency, come when some person or object, from outside
the world at hand, interrupts the flow of expectations. One reason that
glass box technology or pure transparency is impossible is that anomalies
always arise when multiple communities of practice come together, and useful
technologies cannot be designed in all communities at once. Monsters arise
when the legitimacy of that multiplicity is denied. Our residual categories
in that case become clogged and bloated.
<p>Transparency is in theory the endpoint of the trajectory of naturalization,
as complete legitimacy or centrality is the endpoint of the trajectory
of membership in a community of practice. However, due to the multiplicity
of membership of all people, and the persistence of newcomers and strangers,
as well as the multiplicity of naturalization of objects, this is inherently
nonexistent in the real world. For those brief historical moments where
it seems to be the case, it is unstable.
<p>In place of transparency � and it is a good enough counterfeit to work
most of the time as transparency � one encounters convergence: the mutual
constitution of a person or object and their representation. People get
put into categories, and learn from those categories how to behave. Thus
there is the ironic observation that East Enders in London learn cockney
(and how to be cockney) through watching the soap opera East Enders on
television: "I am an East Ender therefore I must talk like this; and I
must drink such and such a brand of beer � ". Aided by bureaucratic institutions,
such cultural features take on a real social weight. If official documents
force an Anglo-Australian, say, to choose one identity or the other; and
if friends and colleagues encourage that person, for the convenience of
small talk, to make a choice � then they are likely to become ever more
Australian: suffering alongside his or her now fellow-countrypeople if
new immigration measures are introduced in America or if �we� lose a cricket
test. The same process occurs with objects � once a film has been thrown
into the X-rated bin, then there is a strong incentive for the director
to make it <i>really</i> X-rated; once a house has been posted as condemned,
then people will feel free to trash it.
<p>Where the difference lies between transparency and convergence is that
where transparency ideally just produces a reflection of the way things
really are (and so, in Jullien�s (1995) beautiful phrase captures the �propensity
of things� in any situation); convergence can radically break down � over
time or across geographical borders. When categories do break down in this
fashion they leave no continuous trace back to the previous regime. So,
for instance, when the category of �hysteric� became medically unfashionable,
then people with (what used to be called) hysteria were distributed into
multiple widely scattered categories. At that juncture, there was no point
in their seeing the same doctors, or learning from each other what hysteria
was �
<p><b>Scaling Up: Generalization and Standards</b>
<p>"Similarity is an institution." --Mary Douglas (1986: 55)
<p>In this whole complicated co-construction process, what are the things
that make objects and statuses seem given, durable, real? For, as Desrosi<font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&Agrave;</font>
res (1990) reminds us, partly through classification work, large scale
bureaucracies are very good at making objects, people and institutions
hold together. Some objects <i>are</i> naturalized in more than one world.
They are not then boundary objects, but rather they become <i>standards</i>
within and across the multiple worlds in which they are naturalized. Much
of mathematics, and in the West, much of medicine and physiology fits this
bill. In the Middle Ages a lot of Christian doctrine fit this too. The
hegemony of patriarchy arose from the naturalization of objects across
a variety of communities of practice, with the exclusion of women from
membership and the denial of our alternative interpretations of objects
(Kramarae 1988; Merchant 1980; Croissant and Restivo, 1995).
<p>When an object becomes naturalized in more than one community of practice,
its naturalization gains enormous power -- to the extent that a basis is
formed for dissent to be viewed as madness or heresy. It is also where
ideas like "laws of nature" get their power, because we are always looking
to other communities of practice as sources of validity, and if as far
as we can look we find naturalization the invisibility layers up and becomes
doubly, triply invisible. Sherry Ortner�s (1974) classic essay on man:culture/woman:nature
shows that this has held for the subjugation of women even where specific
cultural circumstances vary widely, and her model of the phenomenon rests
on the persistent misunderstanding of borderlands and ambiguity in many
cultures. Before her, Simone de Beauvoir (1948) wrote of the ethics of
ambiguity, showing the powerful negative consequences of settling for one
naturalized mode of interaction. We still need an ethics of ambiguity,
still more urgently with the pressure to globalize, and the integration
of systems of representation through information technologies across the
world.
<p>We have presented here a model of memberships, naturalizations, and
the work we do in managing their multiplicity. Further analysis is needed
here to examine different types of categorical work, and how they emerge
under different circumstances. In the next section, we continue with a
discussion of categorization and pragmatism.
<p><b>Boundary Infrastructure</b>
<p>Any working infrastructure serves multiple communities of practice simultaneously
� be these within a single organization or distributed across multiple
organizations. A hospital information system, for example, has to respond
to the separate as well as the combined agendas of nurses, records clerks,
government agencies, doctors, epidemiologists, patients and so forth. In
order to do so, it must bring into play stable regimes of boundary objects
� such that any given community of practice can interface with the information
system and pull out the kinds of information objects that it needs.
<p>Clearly boundary infrastructures are not perfect constructions. The
chimera of a totally unified and universally applicable information system
(still regrettably favored by many) should not be replaced by the chimera
of a distributed, boundary-object driven information system fully respectful
of the needs of the variety of communities it serves. To the contrary,
as we saw in the case of NIC, nurses have needed to make a series of serious
concessions about the nature and quality of their data before hoping to
gain any kind of entry into hospital information systems. As we have seen,
these difficulties generalize � though they are to some extent counterposed
by processes of convergence.
<p>Boundary infrastructures by and large do the work that is required to
keep things basically moving along. Because they deal in regimes and networks
of boundary objects (and not of unitary, well-defined objects), boundary
infrastructures have sufficient play to allow for local variation together
with sufficient consistent structure to allow for the full array of bureaucratic
tools (forms, statistics and so forth) to be applied. Even the most regimented
infrastructure is ineluctably also local: if workarounds are needed they
will be put into place. The ICD, for example, is frequently used to code
cultural expectations (such as low heart attack rates in Japan) even though
these are nowhere explicitly part of the classification system.
<p>What we gain with the concept of boundary infrastructure over the more
traditional unitary vision of infrastructures is the explicit recognition
of the differing constitution of information objects within the diverse
communities of practice which share a given infrastructure.
<p><b>6. Future Directions: Texture and Modeling of Categorical Work and
Boundary Infrastructures</b>
<p><i>If you could say it, you would not need metaphor. If you could conceptualize
it, it would not be metaphor. If you could explain it, you would not use
metaphor.</i> (Morton, 1985: 210)
<p>So far in this chapter we have given a series of analytic categories
which we hope will prove useful in the analysis and design of information
infrastructures. At the limit, as Nelle Morton points out, we arrive at
the sets of metaphors which people use to describe information networks
of all kinds. These metaphors we live by are powerful means of organizing
work and intellectual practice. We will now look at one cluster of metaphors
� centered on the concept of filiations � which we believe, offers promise
for future analytical work.
<p><b>How are Categories Tied to People? : Filiations</b>

<p>Categories touch people in a variety of ways -- they are assigned, they
become self-chosen labels, they may be statistical artifacts. They may
be visible or invisible to any other group or individual. We use the term
filiation here � related via Latin to the French "fil" for thread -- a
thread that goes from a category to a person. This metaphor allows a rich
examination of the architecture of the multiple categories that touch people�s
lives. Threads carry a variety of textural qualities that are often applied
to human interactions: tension, knottiness or smoothness, bundling, proximity,
thickness. We select a small number here to focus on in the worked example
below.
<p><b>Loosely coupled � tightly coupled</b>
<p>A category (or system of categories) may be loosely or tightly coupled
with a person. Gender and age are very tightly coupled with a person as
categories. One of the interesting aspects of the investigation of virtual
identities in MUDs and elsewhere on line is the loosening of these traditionally
tightly coupled threads under highly constrained circumstances (e.g. Turkle,
1994). Loosely coupled categories may be those that are transient, such
as the color one is wearing on a given day or one�s position in a waiting
line. Somewhere in the middle are hair color, which may shift slowly over
a lifetime or change in an afternoon, or marital status.
<p><b>Scope</b>
<p>Categories� filiations have variable scope. Some are durable threads
which cover many aspects of someone�s identity and which are accepted as
such on a very wide or even global scale. (Noting for the record that none
are absolute, none cover all aspects of someone�s identity, and there is
no category, which is completely globally accepted.) The category alive
or dead is quite thick and nearly global. So we can think of two dimensions
of scope: thickness and scale. How thick is the individual strand: gossamer
or thickest rope? With how many others is it shared?
<p><b>What is its ecology?</b>
<p>Classifications have habitats. That is, the filiations between person
and category may be characterized as inhabiting a space or terrain with
some of the properties of any habitat. It may be crowded or sparse, peaceful
or at war, fertile or arid. In order not to mix too many metaphors, two
important questions about filiations and their ecology that may be visualized
in threadlike terms are:
<p>How many ties are there? That is, how many other categories are tied
to this person, and in what density?
<p>Do these threads contradict or complement (torque vs. boundary object
of cooperation)? That is, are the threads tangled, or smoothly falling
together?
<p><b>Who controls the filiation?</b>
<p>The question of who controls any given filiation is vital to an ethical
and political understanding of information systems whose categories attach
to individuals. A first crude characterization concerns whether the filiation
was chosen or imposed (an echo of the sociological standard, achieved or
ascribed); whether it may be removed and by whom; and under whose control
and access is the apparatus to do so. Questions of privacy are important
here, as with medical information classifying someone with a social stigmatized
condition. The nature of the measure for the filiation here is important
loci of control as well. For example, an IQ test may be an important way
to classify people. People at some remove from those who take the test
developed it. The measure, IQ, is controlled from afar. Past criticisms
of IQ tests charge that this control is racially biased and biased by gender,
on these grounds.
<p><b>Is it reversible or irreversible?</b>
<p>Finally, there is the important question of whether the filiation is
reversible. The metaphor of branding someone is not accidental in this
regard, branding meaning that a label is burned into the skin and completely
irreversible. Some forms of filiation have this finality for the individual,
regardless of how the judgment was later regarded (e.g. a charge of guilt
for murder may mean permanent public guilt regardless of a jury�s verdict,
as with the decades� long attempt of Sam Shepard�s son to prove his father�s
innocence). Many are somewhere between, but knowing how reversible is the
filiation is important for understanding its impact.
<p>The metaphor of filiation presented here could be used to characterize
a texture of information systems where categories touch either individuals
or things. The aesthetics of the weave and the degree to which the individual
is bound up or supported by it are among the types of characterizations
that could be made. There are brute renderings, such as having two thick,
irreversible threads tying one person to conflicting categories, as with
the examples above. More subtly, it is possible to think in terms of something
like Granovetter's strength of weak ties, and characterize the thousand
and one classifications which weakly tie people to information systems
as binding or torquing in another way.
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">To summarize. The metaphor of filiation
is useful to the extent that it can be used to ask questions of working
infrastructures in new and interesting ways. Two questions that rise directly
out or our treatment of the metaphor for any individual or group filiation
are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times,Times New Roman">What will be the ecology and distribution
of suffering?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times,Times New Roman">Who controls the ambiguity and visibility
of categories?</font></li>
</ul>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>We have in this chapter argued that there is more to be done in the
analysis of classification systems than deconstructing universal master
narratives. Certainly, such narratives should be challenged. However, we
have attempted to show that there are ways of scaling up from the local
to the social, via the concept of boundary infrastructures, and that we
can in the process recognize our own hybrid natures without losing our
individuality. The value of this approach is that it allows us to intervene
in the construction of infrastructures - which surely exist and are powerful
- as not only critics but also designers.
<p><b>Chapter Ten: Why Classifications Matter</b>
<p>Classifications are powerful technologies. Embedded in working infrastructures
they become relatively invisible without losing any of that power. In this
book we demonstrate that classifications should be recognized as the significant
site of political and ethical work that they are. They should be reclassified.
<p>In the past 100 years, people in all lines of work have jointly constructed
an incredible, interlocking set of categories, standards, and means for
inter-operating infrastructural technologies. We hardly know what we have
built. No one is in control of infrastructure; no one has the power centrally
to change it. To the extent that we live in, on, and around this new infrastructure,
it helps form the shape of our moral, scientific and esthetic choices.
Infrastructure is now the great inner space.
<p>Ethnomethodologists and phenomenologists have shown us that what is
often the most invisible is right under our noses. Everyday categories
are precisely those that have disappeared -- into infrastructure, into
habit, into the taken for granted. These everyday categories are seamlessly
inter-woven with formal, technical categories and specifications. As Cicourel
notes:
<dir>
<dir>The decision procedures for characterizing social phenomena are buried
in implicit common sense assumptions about the actor, concrete persons,
and the observer's own views about everyday life. The procedures seem intuitively
"right" or "reasonable" because they are rooted in everyday life. The researcher
often begins his classifications with only broad dichotomies, which he
expects his data to "fit," and then elaborates on these categories if apparently
warranted by his "data." (1964:21).</dir>
</dir>
The hermeneutic circle is indeed all around us.
<p>There is no simple unraveling of the built information landscape, or,
<i>pace</i>
Zen practice, of unsettling our habits at every waking moment. Black boxes
are necessary, and not necessarily evil. The moral questions arise when
the categories of the powerful become the taken for granted; when policy
decisions are layered into inaccessible technological structures; when
one group's visibility comes at the expense of another's suffering.
<p>There are as well basic research questions implied by this navigation
into infrastructural space. Information technology operates through a series
of displacements, from action to representation, from the politics of conflict
to the invisible politics of forms and bureaucracy. Decades ago, Max Weber
wrote of the iron cage of bureaucracy. Modern humans, he posited, are constrained
at every juncture from true freedom of action by a set of rules of our
own making. Some of these rules are formal, most are not. Information infrastructure
adds another level of depth to the iron cage. In its layers, and in its
complex interdependencies, it is a gossamer web, with iron at its core.
<p>We have looked at several sets of classification schemes � the classifications
of diseases, viruses, tuberculosis, race, and of nursing work. These are
all examples of working classification systems: they are or have been maintained
by organizations, governments and individuals. We have observed several
dances between classifier and classified, but have nowhere seen either
unambiguous entities waiting to be classified or unified agencies seeking
to classify them. The act of classification is of its nature infrastructural,
which means to say that it is both organizational and informational, always
embedded in practice (Keller and Keller, 1996).
<p>In our interviews of public health officials, nurses or scientists,
we have found that they recognize this about their own classification systems.
At the same time, there is little inducement to share problems across domains.
Because of the invisible work involved in local struggles with formal classification
systems and standards, a great deal of what sociologists would call "pluralistic
ignorance" obtains. This is the feeling that "I am the only one". People
often have a picture that somehow their problems are unique: they believe
that other 'real' sciences do not have the same set of makeshift compromises
and workarounds.
<p>It is important in the development and implementation of classifications
(and many related fields � such as the development and deployment of standards
or archives) that we get out of the loop of trying to emulate a distant
perfection that on closer analysis turns out to me just as messy as our
own efforts. The importance lies in a fundamental rethinking of the nature
of information systems. We need to recognize that all information systems
are necessarily suffused with ethical and political values, modulated by
local administrative procedures. These systems are active creators of categories
in the world as well as simulators of existing categories. Remembering
this, we keep open and can explore spaces for change and flexibility that
are otherwise lost forever.
<p>Such politics are common to most systems employing formal representations.
Rogers Hall, in his studies of algebra problem solving by both children
and professional math teachers, talks about the shame that children feel
about their unorthodox methods for arriving at solutions. Often using innovative
techniques such as imaginary devices, but not traditional formulaic means,
they achieved the right answer the wrong way. One child called this "the
dirt way." A grown-up version of the dirt way is related by the example
given earlier of the "good organizational reasons for bad organizational
records" (Bitner and Garfinkel, 1967). There are good organizational reasons
for working around formal systems; these adaptations are necessarily local.
What is global is the need for them.
<p>We have in this book attempted to develop tools for maintaining these
open spaces. Michel Serres has best expressed the fundamental ethical and
political importance of this task. He has argued that the sciences are
very good at what they do: the task of the philosopher is to keep open
and explore the spaces that otherwise would be left dark and unvisited
because of their very success, since new forms of knowledge might arise
out of these spaces. Similarly, we need to consistently explore what is
left dark by our current classifications ('other' categories) and design
classification systems that do not foreclose on rearrangements suggested
by new forms of social and natural knowledge.
<p>There are many barriers to this exploration. Not least among them is
the barrier of boredom. Delving into someone else's infrastructure as we
discussed in the introduction, has about the entertainment value of reading
the white pages of the phone book. One does not encounter the dramatic
stories of battle and victory, of mystery and discovery that make for a
good read.
<p>In an introductory chapter, we laid the theoretical framework for the
discussion of classification as an infrastructural practice, stressing
the political and ethical texturing of classification schemes. In Part
1, we examined the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as a
large-scale long-term system ingrained in the work practices of multiple
organizations and states. We argued that their organizational roots and
operational exercise texture such systems. Such texture is an inescapable,
appropriate feature of their constitution, and it is a feature that merits
extended consideration in a discussion of the politics of infrastructure.
In Part 2, we looked at the intersection between classification and individual
biography in the case of the classification of tuberculosis and of race
classification under apartheid in South Africa. Generalizing the arguments
made in these chapters, we maintained that individuals in the modern State
operate within multiple classification systems � from the small-scale,
semi-negotiated system as with the informal classification of tuberculosis
patients negotiated with doctors up to enforced universal systems such
as race classification. We drew attention to the torquing of individual
biographies as people encounter these reified classifications. Finally,
we examined classification and work practice, taking the example of the
classification of nursing work. We argued that multiple tensions between
representation and autonomy, disability and discretion, forgetting the
past and learning its lessons make such classifications a key site of political
and professionalization work. We are all called upon to justify our productivity
when we are embedded in complex modern organizations. The dilemma faced
by nurses in accounting for their work is on the present in the modern
organization. Even children are not exempt.
<p>We have seen throughout this book that people (and the information systems
they build) routinely conflate formal and informal, prototypical and Aristotelian
aspects of classification. There is no such thing as an unambiguous, uniform
classification system (indeed the deeper one goes into the spaces of classification
expertise � for example librarianship or botanical systematics � the more
perfervid one finds the debates between rival classificatory schools).
This in turn means that there is room in the constitution of any classification
system with organizational and political consequences - and few schemes
if any are without such dimensions � for technical decisions about the
scheme to systematically reflect given organizational and political positions.
Since, then, we are dealing with an agonistic field, there will be no pure
reflection of a single position, but rather dynamic tensions between multiple
positions. And finally, since the classification system is not a pure reflection
of such positions (an impossible aim in its own right � no classification
system can reflect either the social or the natural world fully accurately)
but also integrally a tool for exploring the real world, there is no simple
prediction from how a given set of alliances or tensions leads invariably
to a given classification used in a given way.
<p>As sets of classification systems coalesce into working infrastructures
they become integrated into information systems of all sorts. Thus we have
argued throughout this book that information systems design should be informed
by organizational and political analysis at this level. We are not offering
this as an <i>ex cathedra</i> design principle. Rather, we have � along
with many researchers in the field of social informatics - demonstrated
empirically that invisible organizational structures influence the design
and use of systems: the question is not whether or not this occurs but
rather <i>how</i> to recognize, learn from and plan for the ineluctable
presence of such features in working infrastructures. We have suggested
one design aid here: long term and detailed ethnographic and historical
studies of information systems in use, so that we can build up an analytic
vocabulary appropriate to the task.
<p>Working infrastructures contain multiple classification systems, which
are both invisible, in the senses above, and ubiquitous. The invisibility
of infrastructure makes visualization or description difficult. The metaphors
we reached for to describe infrastructure are ironic and somehow childish.
We speak of "way down in the underwear," "underneath the system," or use
up/down metaphors such as "runs under," or "runs on top of." Lakoff and
Johnson (1980) write of metaphors we live by. Our infrastructural metaphors
show how baffled we often are by these systems. They are like undergarments,
or tunnel dwellers.
<p>Another set of metaphors often used in organizations speaks indirectly
to the experience of infrastructure. These are the metaphors of texture,
omnipresent in human relationships. Texture metaphors speak to the densely
patterned interaction of infrastructures and the experience of living in
the "classification society." Texture speaks to the way that classifications
and standards link the individual with larger processes and structures.
These links generate both enabling/constraining patterns over a set of
systems (texture), and developmental patterns for an individual operating
within a given set (trajectory). Thus we have used the metaphor of the
texture of a classification system to explore the fact that any given classification
provides surfaces of resistances (where the real resist its definition),
blocks against certain agendas and smooth roads for others. Within this
metaphorical landscape, the individual's trajectory � often, for all that,
perceived as continuous and self-consistent � is at each moment twisted
and torqued by classifications and vice versa.
<p>Therefore we have, through our analysis of various classification systems,
attempted to provide a first approximation to an analytic language which
recognizes that the architecture of classification schemes is simultaneously
a moral and an informatic one. This book has brought to light as crucial
to the design process the reading of classification schemes as political
and cultural productions. We have stressed that any classification scheme
can be read in this fashion. We initially deliberately eschewed cases like
DSM-IV, where categories have often already become explicit objects of
political contention, such as "homosexual" or "pre-menstrual tension."
In the psychiatric case, there can in this sense often be a more direct
read-off from political exigencies to disease categories. Although such
readings are of course highly valuable in their own right (see Kirk and
Kutchins, 1992; Kutchins and Kirk, 1997 and Figert, 1996), we first took
the more muted cases posed by the ICD, where the politics were quieter.
This we hoped would show the generalizability of the thesis that all category
systems are moral and political entities. This was balanced later in the
volume with an analysis of the much more obviously politically laden categories
generated by the pro-apartheid government and its scientific apologists.
<p>This book has implications for both designers and users (and we are
all increasingly both) of complex information spaces. It provides intellectual
and methodological tools for recognizing and working with the ethical and
political dimensions of classification systems. In particular we have underlined
several design exigencies, that speak both to the architecture of information
systems encoding classification systems and to their development and change:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Recognizing the balancing act of classifying.</i> Classification schemes
always represent multiple constituencies. They can do so most effectively
through the incorporation of ambiguity � leaving a certain terms open for
multiple definitions across different social worlds: they are in this sense
boundary objects. Designers must recognize these zones of ambiguity, protecting
them where necessary in order to leave free play for the schemes to do
their organizational work.</li>

<li>
<i>Rendering voice retrievable.</i> As classification systems get ever
more deeply embedded into working infrastructures they risk getting black-boxed
and thence made both potent and invisible. By keeping the voices of classifiers
and their constituents present, the system can retain maximum political
flexibility. This includes the key ability to be able to change with changing
natural, organizational and political imperatives. A caveat here, drawn
from Chapter 7's lesson about the invisibility of nursing work: we are
not simply celebrating visibility, or naively proposing a populist agenda
for the empire of classification. Visibility is not an unmitigated good.
Rather, by retrievability, we are suggesting that under many circumstances,
the "rule by no one" or the "iron cage of bureaucracy" is strengthened
by its absence. When classification systems and standards acquire inertia
because they are part of invisible infrastructure, the public is <i>de
facto</i> excluded from policy participation.</li>

<li>
<i>Being sensitive to exclusions.</i> We have in particular drawn attention
here to the distribution of residual categories (who gets to determine
what is other). Classification systems always have 'other' categories,
to which actants (entities or people) who remain effectively invisible
to the scheme are assigned. A detailed analysis of these others throws
into relief the organizational structure of any scheme (Derrida, 1998).
Residual categories have their own texture that operates like the silences
in a symphony to pattern the visible categories and their boundaries.</li>
</ul>
Stewart Brand's (1994) wonderful book, <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, gives
many examples of how buildings get designed as they are used as much as
on the architect's drawing-board. Thus a house with a balcony and numerous
curlicues around the roof will become a battened-down square fortress block
under the influence of a generation of storms from the northeast. Big single-family
mansions become apartment buildings as a neighborhood's finances change.
These criteria generalize to classification systems. Through these three
design criteria we are drawing attention to the fact that architecture
becomes archaeology over time. This in turn may become a cycle.
<p>Overall, we have argued that classifications are a key part of the standardization
processes that are themselves the cornerstones of working infrastructures.
People have always navigated sets of classification spaces. Mary Douglas
(1984), among others, has drawn attention to this feature of all societies
from the indigenous and tribal to the most 'industrialized. Today, with
the emergence of new information infrastructures, these classification
systems are becoming ever more densely interconnected. This integration
began roughly in the 1850s, coming to maturity in the late 19<font size=-2>th</font>
century with the flourishing of systems of standardization for international
trade and epidemiology. Local classification schemes (of diseases, nursing
work, viruses�) are now increasingly giving way to these standardized international
schemes which themselves are being aligned with other large scale information
systems. In this process, it is becoming easier for the individual to act
and perceive him or her self as a completely naturalized part of the "classification
society," since this thicket of classifications is both operative (defining
the possibilities for action) and descriptive. As we are socialized to
become that which can be measured by our increasingly sophisticated measurement
tools, the classifications increasingly naturalize across wider scope.
On a pessimistic view, we are taking a series of increasingly irreversible
steps towards a given set of highly limited and problematic descriptions
of what the world is and how we are in the world.
<p>For these reasons, we have argued in this book that it is politically
and ethically crucial to recognize the vital role of infrastructure in
the "built moral environment." Seemingly purely technical issues like how
to name things and how to store data in fact constitutes much of human
interaction, and much of what we come to know as natural. We have argued
that a key for the future is to produce flexible classifications, whose
users are aware of their political and organizational dimensions, and which
explicitly retain traces of their construction. In the best of all possible
worlds, at any given moment the past could be reordered to better reflect
multiple constituencies now and then. Only thus we will be able to fully
learn the lessons of the past. In this same optimal world, we could tune
our classifications to reflect new insitutional arrangements or personal
trajectories - reconfigure the world on the fly. The only good classification
is a living classification.
<p><i>Envoi</i>
<p>We would hate to have to assign a Dewey classification number to this
book, which straddles sociology, anthropology, history and information
systems, and design. Our modest hope is that it will not find its way onto
the fantasy shelves�.
