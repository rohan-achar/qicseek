Bowker<p>Graduate School of Library and Information Science<p>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<i></i><p><i></i><p><i>Introduction - Well do I remember...</i><p>"I remember that I had a typical English grammar school education from ages11-14, after which time the family emigrated to Australia".  This is a kind ofreminiscence we can all relate to, but it is clearly problematic, in my case,with respect to the issue of the truth about the past.  It is a memory ladenwith my present understanding of the category `English education', which feedspartly at least off the film <i>If </i> about English private schooling, and sowhich `should' not be relevant.  Furthermore, I saw the film some years after Ileft England and school both.  So the framework that contains, in some sense,my memories of what it was like in those years could not possibly have existedat the time that I experienced them.  It may still be a valid and usefulframework; however it almost certainly helps me to remember some parts of mylife (which make me like Malcolm MacDowell in the film) and forget others (lessheroic and less nihilistic).<p><p>Recall is in general a problematic concept, even when we can assume that peopleare trying to tell the truth about the past.  Studies of people's intenselyremembered `flashbulb memories' (what were you doing at the time that Kennedywas assassinated) have proved them to be often false (Brown and Kulik, 1982).John Dean claimed fairly total recall at the time of Watergate - but as UlricNeisser points out through analysis of the tapes made in the Oval Office heremembered neither conversations, nor even gists of conversations - but ratheran ideal set of possible conversations which encoded his perceived truth of thesituation and his fantasies about his own role therein (Neisser, 1982; but seethe excellent critique in Edwards and Potter, 1992<ahref="forget_fn.html#fn0">1</a>).  People cannot remember accurately how they feltin the past: they take the present as a benchmark and then work from acurrently held belief about change or stability in their attitudes: thus whenasked how you felt six months ago about, say, a TV series, your memory willnecessarily be colored by what has happened since in that series (Linton,1982).  If all history is history of the present, then one might surely thinkof memory as ineluctably a construction of the present.  These studies fromcognitive science suggest that truth or falsity is not a simple concept when itcomes to analyzing organizational memory in science or elsewhere (cf Hacking,1995, Chapter 17 - on the indeterminacy of the past).  Thus Bannon and Kuutti,1996 stress that if ]</a>`organizational memory' is at all a useful concept, itis so to the extent that it refers to active remembering which carries with itits own context - so that it comes in the form not of true or false facts butof multifaceted stories open to interpretation.  <p><p>Neisser (1982), building on Tulving's famous distinction between episodic andsemantic memory (remembering what vs remembering how) introduces a third kindof memory - `repisodic memory' (remembering what was <i>really </i>happening).Against this increasing differentiation and specialization in the concept ofmemory, we find a single and undifferentiated definition of `forgetting' - itis `not remembering'.  Further, forgetting in all its guises has frequentlybeen seen as necessarily a problem.  Freud encouraged the recall of suppressedmemories (see Hacking, 1995 for a discussion of memory and veracity in Freud).Historians insist that we must learn the lessons of the past.  Yrjo Engestrom,in his memorable paper on `organizational forgetting' (1988) discusses problemsraised by the ways in which doctors forget; though his activity theoreticalperspective on the organic links between internal and external memory traces isparticularly fruitful in that it provides a model for ethnographic studies ofcollective memory.  Bitner and Garfinkel (1967) are among the few to observeand describe an ecology of forgetting, in their account of `good'organizational reasons for `bad' clinical records'.<p><p>Total recall, in individuals or organizations, is neither desirable norpossible.  Recent work in organizational theory has suggested that perhaps itis good on occasion to forget everything about the past, in order to start overwithout being trapped in old routines (Wackers, 1995).   There are indeedseveral good reasons for organizations to forget things about their own past.First, it might be the case that rediscovery is easier than remembering,especially where the overhead of constructing a sufficiently precise archive sothat a fine-grained situation can be remembered is high.  Thus in order toremember down to the level of detail that the English employees might notunderstand `z' when pronounced `zee' one would need an immense archive surelyunnecessary for a telephone company but perhaps vital for a nuclear power plantwhere quick interpretation of a loudspeaker broadcast of `Z-Alpha-One' mighthave safety consequences.  Secondly, extending Chandler (1977), one can see thedevelopment of statistics as a filtering mechanism that allows a central officenot to have to remember everything about a company's day to day running inorder to make things run smoothly: the filtering works as proactive forgetting.A third positive mode of forgetting is when an organization wants to change itsidentity.  In such a case the argument that `we have always done things thisway' stands in the way of breaking new ground.  Hughes (1989 [1883]) describedthe change at Rugby school under Arnold in this light, showing Arnoldimperceptibly changing the way things were done in such a way that group memorywas never mobilized against the changes.  In general, if  memory is being usedas a tool of reification or projection then it can have harmful consequences.<p><p>This paper is about how organizations forget things selectively about the pastin the process of producing knowledge. I shall argue that there are two majorkinds of organizational forgetting in the process of producing and thenmaintaining classification systems in the workplace:<p><li>	clearance - the erection of a barrier in the past at a certain point so thatno information or knowledge can leak through to the present;</li><p><li>erasure - the ongoing destruction of selective traces in the present.</li><p>I shall then argue that the classification systems which are created permit theorganization to move from heterogeneous forms of memory operating withinmultiple frameworks to the privileging  of a form of memory (potential memory)operating within a well-defined information infrastructure subtended byclassification systems.  I shall demonstrate that in this process, the decisionof whether to opt in to an infrastructure, with its attendant memory frames andmodes of forgetting, or to stay out of it, is of great political and ethicalimport .  I shall firstly follow this set of arguments through with respect toa case study of the development of a classification of nursing work, and willthen broaden the discussion out to more general considerations ofclassification and memory.<p><p><i>Part 1 - Nursing classifications and organizational forgetting</i><p>The common thread for this part will be an analysis of the ways in which anursing group in Iowa city is classifying nursing work. Nursing is particularlyinteresting with respect to forgetting, since nursing work has traditionallybeen invisible and removed at the earliest opportunity from the medical record. In the 1988, a group was formed in the College of Nursing at the University ofIowa to create what they call a Nursing Interventions Classification -henceforth NIC (McCloskey and Bulechek, 1996), see Diagram 1 and Diagram 2.There was already in place a somewhat badly maintained classification systemfor nursing diagnoses (which is to say what specific nursing needs a givenpatient had); but there was no standardized language for describing what it wasthat nurses did.   The group published a first edition of their system in 1992,and a revised and expanded version came out in 1996.<p><p>In general, nursing has not been able as an institution to draw on an activememory.  Rather, nursing has been seen as an intermediary profession that doesnot need to leave a trace.  As nursing informatician Castles notes, citingHuffman on medical records management: Athe nursing records are the first to bepurged from the patient records; there is thus no lasting documentation ofnursing diagnoses or nursing interventions and no method of storage andretrieval of nursing data. (Castles, 1981, p.42)<p><p>NIC itself is a fascinating system.  Those of us studying it see it as anethnomethodological nirvana.  Some categories, like bleeding reduction - nasal,are on the surface relatively obvious and codable into discrete units of workpractice to be carried out on specific occasions.  But what about the equallyimportant categories of hope installation and humor (see Diagram 3)?  Hopeinstallation includes the subcategory of `Avoid masking the truth'. This is notso much something that nurses do on a regular basis, as something that theyshould not do constantly.  It also includes: `Help the patient expand spiritualself'.  Here the contribution that the nurse is making is to an implicitlifelong program of spiritual development. With respect to humor, the verydefinition of the category suggests the operation of a paradigm shift:"Facilitating the patient to perceive, appreciate, and express what is funny,amusing, or ludicrous in order to establish relationships"; and it isunclear how this could ever be attached to a time line: it is something thenurse should always do while doing other things.  Further, contained within thenursing classification is an anatomy of what it is to be humorous, and a theoryof what humor does.    The recommended procedures break humor down intosubelements.   One should determine the types of humor appreciated by thepatient; determine the patient's typical response to humor (e.g. laughter orsmiles); select humorous materials that create moderate arousal for theindividual  (for example `picture a forbidding authority figure dressed only inunderwear'); encourage silliness and playfulness and so on to make a total offifteen sub-activities: any one of which might be scientifically relevant.  Afeature traditionally attached to the personality of the nurse (being acheerful and supportive person) is now attached through the classification tothe job description as an intervention which can be accounted for.<p><p>The Iowa group, the kernel of whom were teachers of nursing administration,made essentially three arguments for the creation of a nursing classification.First, it was argued that without a standard language to describe nursinginterventions, there would be no way of producing a scientific body ofknowledge about nursing.  NIC in theory would be articulated with two otherclassification systems: NOC (the nursing sensitive patient outcomesclassification scheme) and NANDA (the nursing diagnosis scheme).  The threecould work together thusly.  One could perform studies over a set of hospitalsemploying the three schemes in order to check if a given category of patientresponded well to a given category of nursing intervention.  Rather than thiscomparative work being done anecdotally as in the past through the accumulationof experience, it could be done scientifically through the conduct ofexperiments.  The Iowa Intervention project made up a jingle: NANDA, NIC andNOC to the tune of Hickory, Dickory, Dock to stress this interrelationship ofthe three schemes.  The second argument for classifying nursing interventionswas that it was a key strategy for defending the professional autonomy ofnursing.  The Iowa nurses are very aware of the literature onprofessionalization - notably Schon (1983) - and are aware of the force ofhaving an accepted body of scientific knowledge as their domain.  (IndeedAndrew Abbott, taking as his central case the professionalization of medicine,makes this one of his key attributes of a profession.)  The third argument wasthat nursing, alongside other medical professions, was moving into the newworld of computers.  As the representational medium changed, it was importantto be able to talk about nursing in a language that computers could understand(see Diagram 4) - else nursing work would not be represented at all in thefuture, and would risk being even further marginalized than it was at present.<i></i><p><i></i><p><i>Forgetting 1 - Clearance</i><p><i>Grand Historiographer, Sima Qin (1994 [ca 100BC]), writing of the burning ofthe books in 213BC, notes that the Chief Minister advised the emperor that:Aall who possess literature such as the Songs, the Documents, and the sayingsof the hundred schools should get rid of it without penalty.  If they have notgot rid of it a full thirty days after the order has reached them, they shouldbe branded and sent to do forced labor on the walls.  there should be exemptionfor books concerned with medicine, pharmacy, divination by tortoise-shell andmilfoil, the sowing of crops, and the planting of trees (31).  In response tothis, the Emperor ordered the famous burning of the books - to cite Qin: AtheFirst Emperor collected up and got rid of the Songs, the Documents, and thesayings of the hundred schools in order to make the people stupid and ensurethat in all under Heaven there should be no rejection of the present by usingthe past.  The clarification of laws and regulations and the settling ofstatutes and ordinances all stared with the First Emperor.  He standardizeddocuments. (31).  </i><p><p>There was a primitive act of clearance in the establishment of NIC.  Byclearance, I mean a complete wiping away of the past of nursing theory in orderto start with a clean slate - much as the first cultivators burned the forestto create land suitable for tilling in ordered rows (I am drawing here onSerres' (1993) work on clearance and origins in geometry).  The nurses saidthat until now there had been no nursing science and therefore there was nonursing knowledge to preserve.  There is, one nursing informatician ruefullynoted: AIt is recognized that in nursing, overshadowed as it is by the rubricsof medicine and religion, no nurse since Nightingale has had the recognizedauthority to establish nomenclature or procedure by fiat.  There are nouniversally accepted theories in nursing on which to base diagnoses, and, infact, independent nursing functions have not yet gained universal acceptance bynurses or by members of other health professions". (Castles, 1981, 40)Nursing, it was argued, had until now been a profession without form; nothingcould be preserved.  There was no way of coding past knowledge and linking itto current practice  - it was noted at a conference to establish a standardizednursing minimum data set (information about nursing practice that would becollected from every care facility) that: "The lists of interventions for anyone condition are long partially because nursing has a brief history as aprofession in the choosing of interventions and lacks information fordecision-making.  As a profession, nursing has failed to set priorities amonginterventions; nurses are taught and believe they should do everythingpossible". (McCloskey and Bulechek, 1992, 79) <p><p>In the face of this view of the nurse as the inglorious other - doingeverything that nobody else does - should all previous nursing knowledge beabandoned?  William Cody, in an open letter to the Iowa Intervention Teampublished in <u>Nursing Outlook</u> in 1995 charged that this was preciselywhat would follow from widespread adoption of NIC: AIt would appear that thenursing theorists who gave nursing its first academic leg to stand on, as itwere, are deliberately being frozen out.  I would like to ask Drs McCloskey andBulechek, Why is there no substantive discussion of nursing theory in yourarticle?  How can you advocate standardizing 'the language of nursing' byadopting the language of only one paradigm?  How do you envision therelationship between the 'standardized' masses and those nurse scholars withdiffering views?  (Cody, 1995, 93).  The Project team responded that indeedclearance was an issue: Athe Iowa group contends that taxonomic developmentrepresents a radical shift in theory construction in which the grand conceptualmodels are not debated, but transcended. We believe that, as a scientificcommunity, nursing has moved to the point of abandoning the conceptual modelsof nursing theorists as forming the science base of the discipline (McCloskey,Bulechek and Tripp-Reimer, 1995, 95).  <p><p>It is not just at the level of nursing theory that this act of clearance isseen as unsettling.  Practicing nurses implementing NIC at one of four test bedsites have complained that learning to use NIC together with the new computersystem it is embedded in is like going to a foreign country where you have tospeak the language; and to make matters worse you have to go to a new countryevery day. More prosaically, they say that they feel they are going from beingexperts to novices<a href="forget_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a>The argument was made that quite simply there has been no work done in thepast: AThe discipline of nursing has not yet constructed a cohesive body ofscientific knowledge (Tripp-Reimer et al, 1996, p.2).   However, there is acomplexity here that often arises in connection with the strategy of clearance.One wants to be able to say that nurses <i>now</i> do something which isvaluable and adaptable to scientific principles; while at the same timemaintain that nurses have not yet (until the development of the classificationsystem) been able to develop any nursing theory and thence any systematic,scientific improvement in practice.  This same article, on the dimensionalstructure of nursing interventions, tackles this problem directly.Tripp-Reimer argues that there must be a cycle of forgetting in the developmentof the new classification scheme. The article begins with a quote from ChungTzu: <p>The purpose of a fish trap is to catch fish.  When the fish are caught, thetrap is forgotten.<p>The purpose of a rabbit snare is to catch rabbits.  When the rabbits arecaught, the snare is forgotten.<p>The purpose of words is to convey ideas.  When the ideas are grasped, the wordsare forgotten.<p>Seek those who have forgotten the words. (p.2)<p>It is argued that the traditional grand theories had a Acertain limited utilitybeyond their historical importance in that they provided a structure foreducational programs.  However, in the field expert nurses soon `forgot' thesewords and developed their own schemata to get at the deep structure of thenursing situation (there is indeed a reference to transformational grammarhere).  Now using NIC categories as a research tool, one could uncover thethree key dimensions of nursing work (the intensity, focus, and complexity ofcare) - which experts always already new about, without there having been anursing science.  Having passed through the purifying cycle of forgetting, onecould finally Abring intuitive clinical decision-making to a conscious level.There is a double complexity to this cycle.  First is the fact that the firstauthor, Toni Tripp-Reimer,  is a cultural anthropologist turned nursinginformatician well versed in Kuhn, Lakoff and others.  The organization thatproduces NIC has to be broadly enough construed, on occasion, to include thecommunity of sociologists of science and linguistics, even though thisinclusion may never be represented overtly in the records of the classificationscheme.  (In passing, this can form a kind of organizational memory that canflip into forgetting - storing information in locations once within the networkof an organization but now outside of it;  a variety of outsourcing gone sour).The second is that it reflects a tension between what nurses already know andwhat the science of nursing will tell them.  The NIC team in general areclaiming both that nursing is already a science, and that it is one which hasnot yet been formulated: they need to maintain the former in order to justifythe profession against current attacks, and the latter in order to justifytheir classification system, which when in place will protect it from futureattacks.  One is reminded of Piaget's (1969) assertion that our earliestintuitions are of the relativistic nature of time, and that we need to unlearnour school lessons in order both to access the latest science and to get backin touch with our childhood insights.   The act of clearance is to take awayuseless theory; then ethnographic work will uncover the true science (alwaysalready there) which NIC can express.  The act of clearance, then, is not oneof simple denial of the past - though complex historical narratives need to beconstructed in order to distinguish the two.<p><p>I am not of course here accepting the position that such clearance leads to thecreation of true science - the issue of the validity or not of nursingknowledge is entirely orthogonal to my purpose. I am producing an anatomy ofwhat it has meant in the case of nursing to create such a science - and I willargue later that this is not an accidental feature of their work, but can beseen as a core strategy over the centuries in the creation of sciences.   Thestrategy itself provides a way of managing a past that threatens to grow out ofcontrol: one can declare by fiat that the past is irrelevant to nursing science(while, in Tripp-Reimer's case validating the past as embodied in current bestpractice) in the development of a classification scheme which will provide fora good ordering of memory in the future - so that nothing henceforth deemedvital will be lost.<p><p><p><i>Forgetting 2 - Erasure</i><p><i>Donald Crowhurst went quietly mad on a round-the-world yachting race and laybecalmed on the ocean developing a theory of the cosmic mind whilst at the sametime completing and radioing in an immaculate official log that had him winningthe race at a record pace.  Crowhurst's double log surfaces within his madnessas contemplation on the nature of time: AThe Kingdom of God has an areameasured in square hours.  It is a kingdom with all the time in the world - wehave used all the time available to us and must now seek an imaginary sort oftime' (Tomalin and Hall, 1970, 259).</i><p><p>With the strategy of clearance, we saw the complete wiping-clean of the slateso that a single origin for nursing science could be created and so that fromthat point of origin nursing actions could be coded and remembered in anorganizationally and scientifically useful fashion.  A second mode of directedforgetting in organizations is erasure: the constant filtering out ofinformation deemed not worthy of preserving for organization's futurepurposes.<p><p>The selective  erasure of nursing records within hospital information systemshas been drastic.  As noted above, nursing records are the first destroyed whena patient is released: the hospital administration does not need them (nursingis lumped in with the price of the room); doctors consider them irrelevant tomedical research; and nursing theorists are not well enough entrenched todemand their collection.  Huffman (1990, 319), in a standard textbook onmedical records management writes: <p>As nurses' notes are primarily a means of communication between the physiciansand nurses, they have served their most important function during the episodeof care.  Therefore, to reduce the bulk and make medical records lesscumbersome to handle, some hospitals remove the nurses' notes from record ofadult patients when medical record personnel assemble and check the medicalrecord after discharge of the patient.  The nurses' notes are then filed inchronological order in some place less accessible than the current files untilthe statute of limitations has expired, and they are destroyed.<p>Traditionally nurses have facilitated themselves out of the equation: thoughthey may not have an official trace of their own past, their duty is toremember for others.   In one of those vague but useful generalizations thatcharacterize information statistics, it was asserted, in a book onnext-generation nursing information systems, that 24 percent of total hospitaloperating costs were devoted to information handling.  Nursing, it is stated, Aaccounted for most of the information handling costs (28 percent to 34 percentof nurses' time); and what is worse, Ain recent years, external regulatoryfactors, plus increasing organizational and health care complexity, haveaugmented the central position of information in the health care environment."(Zielstorff et al., 1993, 5) The nursing profession acts as a distributedmemory system for doctors and hospital administrators but in so doing is deniedits own official memory.<p><p>Even when the erasure is not mandated, it has been voluntary.  One text on anursing classification system cites as a motif of the profession an observationthat: A'The subject of record-keeping has probably never been discussed at aconvention without some agitated nurse arising to ask if she is expected toneglect her patients in order to write down information about them. ....'(Martin and Scheet, 1992, 21 - echoing a 1917 source).  And Joanne McCloskey,one of the two principal architects of NIC notes that: A...the most convincingargument against nursing service or Kardex care plans is the absence of them.Although written care plans are a requirement by the Joint Commission forHospital Accreditation and a condition for participation in Medicare, few plansare, in fact, written.  (McCloskey, 1981, 120).   In her magisterial study ofthe International Classification of Diseases, Ann Fagot-Largeault (1989) notesthe same reluctance on the part of doctors to spend time accurately filling ina death certificate (itself a central tool for epidemiologists) when they mightbe helping live patients.  Thus there is, in Engestrom's (1988) terms, a blockbetween internal memory and external memory: because representational worktakes time, the form fillers systematically erase complex representations thatthey hold in their heads in favor of summary ones - in the case of the ICDthere are many complaints because of the overuse of general disease terms or`other' categories; in the case of a computerized NIC, nurses are suspected bythe NIC implementation team of using the choices that appear before them on ascreen (which they can elect with a light pen) rather than searching throughthe system for the apt descriptor.<p><p>One of the main problems that the nurses have is that they are trying tosituate their activity visibly within an informational world which has bothfactored them out of the equation and maintained that they should be sofactored - since what nurses do can be defined precisely as that which is notmeasurable, finite, packaged, accountable.  In nursing theorist Jenkins' terms:ANurses have functioned in the post-World War II era as the humanisticcounterbalance to an increasingly technology-driven medical profession(Jenkins, 1988, 92).  They have tried to insert nursing as something that fitsnaturally into a world partly defined by the erasure of nursing and other modesof invisible and articulation work - it is like technicians seeking new ways ofwriting scientific papers so that their work gets acknowledged and yet thenature of scientific truth is not impeached.  Sometimes, as we will see, thenurses are driven by their logic to impeach medical truth; sometimes tochallenge orthodoxy in organization science; sometimes to restructure nursingso that these challenges will not be necessary.  At the end of the day therewill be an information infrastructure for medical work which contains anaccount of nursing activity: the move to informational panoptica isoverwhelming in this profession as in many others.  With projects like NIC,which offer new classification systems to embed in databases, tools, andreports we get to see what is at stake in making invisible work visible.<p><p>I have in this section explored two strategies, clearance and erasure.  Some ofthe points made here in the context of organizational forgetting relate toarguments within the sociology of science about the nature of scientificrepresentations of nature - notably deleting the work (Star, 1989, 1991;Shapin, 1989),  and the deletion of modalities in the development of scientifictexts (Latour, 1987) -  that is to say the argument that as a scientificstatement gets ever closer to being accepted as fact, historical contingenciesget progressively stripped from its enunciation.  Why, then, talk at all aboutmemory and forgetting when representation and its literature can do much of thesame work?  The concept of representation tends naturally to abstract away theongoing work of individual or organizational agents (compare here Woolgar,1995, 163).  It is difficult to express the fact that the representation canhave different meanings at different times and places in the organization in alanguage which has been used rather to demonstrate the conjuring of a singlearticulation of `fact'.  The act of remembering a fact organizationallyinvolves not only mobilizing a set of black-boxed allies (in Latour's terms)but also translating from the context of storage to the present situation (onemight store a fact for reason x but recall it for reason y).  Further, withinan organizational context  it is easier to explore the distribution of memoryand forgetting than the distribution of representation.  Finally, there it isalways a temptation when talking of representation to fall into a cognitivisttrap of assuming the primacy of the cognitive act.  By concentrating on`following the actors', sociologists of science have as a rule produced alanguage which privileges the scientific `fact' and its circulation and whichputs the infrastructure supporting that fact relatively into the background(what goes on inside the black box, or indeed what black boxes look like, isseen as irrelevant).  From the perspective of organizational memory, a modalitycan be deleted in a number of different ways: it might be distributed (held inanother part of the organization than in that which produces the text); builtinto the infrastructure (the work environment is changed such that the modalityis never encountered); or simply dismissed.  Looking at ways of distributingmemory and operating forgetting we can, therefore, look in more fine-graineddetail at what happens as the representation  moves into and out ofcirculation.<p><p>Clearance is a strategy employed internally within the profession of nursing asa tool for providing an origin for the science of nursing; erasure is employedexternally on the profession of nursing as a tool for rendering nursing atransparent distributed memory system.  The logic of the relationship betweenclearance and erasure has been that the nurses are operating the clearance oftheir own past in order to combat the erasure of their present in the recordsof medical organizations.  Medical information systems, they argue, shouldrepresent the profession of nursing as if it just began yesterday - forotherwise they will copy the transparency of nursing activity from onerepresentational space (the hospital floor and paper archives) to another (theelectronic record).  This poses, then, the question of what happens when a newecology of attention (what can be forgotten and what should be remembered) isinaugurated with the development of a new information infrastructure.<p><p><i>Forgetting, classification and potential memory</i><p><i>James Fentress and Chris Wickham (1992, 13), in a work reminiscent ofFrances Yates' (1966), argue that artificial memory systems went on the waneafter Descartes: AInstead of a search for the perfectly proportioned imagecontaining the 'soul' of the knowledge to be remembered, the emphasis was onthe discovery of the right logical category.  The memory of this system oflogical categories and scientific causes would exempt the individual from thenecessity of remembering everything in detail. ... The problem of memorizingthe world, characteristic of the sixteenth century, evolved into the problem ofclassifying it scientifically.</i><p><p>Memory - individual and organizational - is in general filtered through aclassification system, which permits encoding of multiple bits of informationabout the environment into a single coherent framework (see Schachter, 1996:98-133).  Edouard Clarap&Euml;de (who performed the initial notoriousexperiment of having a stranger rush into the classroom, do somethingoutrageous, and then have students describe what happened) noted as early as1907 that: "that the past - even of a simple event - was less a record than asort of taxonomy.  Not perceptions, but categorization of familiar types wasthe major function of memory" (cited in Matsuda, 1996: 109).  <p><p>Any information infrastructure to an organization - paper or electronic; formalor informal - claims by its nature to contain all and only the information thatis needed for the smooth running of the organization.  Organizations frequentlywant to know everything relevant about some past action.  For example if thereis a black-out along in the West due to a tree falling in Idaho, an awfulamount of information needs to be recalled in order for the connection to bemade.  Frequently, a prime function of record keeping in the organization is tokeep track of what is going on such that, should anyone ever want to know(auditors, a commission of inquiry and so forth) a complete reconstruction ofthe state of the organization at a particular moment can be made.  For exampleHutchins (1995: 20) talks about the role of the logs kept by navy ships of alltheir movements: "Aboard naval vessels  records are always kept -primarily for reasons of safety, but also for purposes of accountability.Should there be a problem, the crew will be able to show exactly where the shipwas and what it was doing at the time of the mishap".  However, in order forsomething to be remembered officially by an organization it must be recorded ona form; and forms necessarily impose classification systems (Berg and Bowker,forthcoming).  The reconstruction will not cover literally everything that wasgoing on at a particular moment, but only things that fit into theorganization's accepted classification scheme of relevant events.  I shallrefer to the kind of memory that is encoded in an organization's files for thepurposes of a possible future reconstruction as `potential memory'.  I am usingthe word `potential' to draw attention to the distributed, mediated nature ofthe record: no one person remembers everything about a medical intervention;and generally it can be processed through an organization without ever havingbeen recalled.  However, there is a possible need to recall any oneintervention in huge detail: and the only way that the possible need can be metis through the construction of a classification system which allows for theefficient pigeon-holing of facts.<p><p>Within the hospital, nursing work has been deemed irrelevant to any possiblefuture reconstruction; it has been canonically invisible, in Star's (1991)term.  The logic of NIC's advocators is that what has been excluded from therepresentational space of medical practice should be included.  <p><p>Operating within the space of erasure which is at once home for them and athreat to their continued existence, the nurses in Iowa have thought long andhard about the politics and philosophy of classifying their activities suchthat they fit into the hospital's potential memory.  They do not want to flipover from being completely invisible to being far too visible.  They havedecided to name, but not to name too much.  To this end they have adopted theirown practice of continuing partial erasure (where <i>they</i> limit the natureand scope of erasure) - for three reasons:<p>They have decided to specify uniquely down to the level of interventions, butto leave the sub-categories of activities as relatively fluid - severalpossibly contradictory activities are subsumed under a single intervention (seeDiagram 3).  This allows, they argue, for a recognition of local differencesand local autonomy (so central to the nursing self-image) whilst providing thenecessary degree of specification for entry into the world of potentialmemory.<p>It is harder to hive off aspects of nursing duties and give them to lower paidadjuncts if that work is relatively opaque.  The test sites that areimplementing NIC have provided some degree of resistance here, arguing thatactivities should be specified - so that, within a soft decision support modela given diagnosis can trigger a nursing intervention constituted of a single,well-defined set of activities.  As Marc Berg (forthcoming 1996)  has noted inhis study of medical expert systems, such decision support can only workuniversally if local practices are rendered fully standard. A key professionalstrategy for nursing - particularly in the face of the ubiquitous processre-engineer - is realized by deliberate non-representation in the informationinfrastructure.  What is remembered in the formal information systems resultingis attuned to professional strategy and to the information requisites of thenurses' take on what nursing science is.<p>There is a brick wall that they come up against when dealing with nurses on thespot: if they overspecify an intervention (that is break it down into too manyconstituent parts), then it gets called, in the field, an NSS classification -where NSS stands for `No shit, Sherlock' and is not used (Timmermans, Bowkerand Star, forthcoming).  The project team sees the classification scheme ashaving to be very prolix at present; but when the practice of nursing itself isfully standardized, some of the words will be able to wither away.  They pointto intervention classifications used by doctors, which are much less verbose -and can afford to be, they argue, because every doctor knows the standard formof treatment for, say, appendicitis.  (Though they also argue that there arelocal variations in medical practice which have been picked up by goodreporting procedures, and that NIC will be able to provide such a service fornursing - leading to an improvement in the quality of practice). It is assumedthat any reasonable education in nursing or medicine should lead to a commonlanguage wherein things do not need spelling out to any ultimate degree.  Theinformation space will be sufficiently well pre-structured that some detailscan be assumed.  Attention to the finer-grained details is delegated to theeducational system, where it is overdetermined.<p>These NIC erasure strategies - dealing with overspecification and the politicaldrive to relative autonomy by dropping things out of the representational space- are essential for the development of a successful potential memory. The twoforms of erasure of local context are needed in order to create the veryinfrastructure in which nursing can both appear as a science like any other andyet nursing as a profession can continue to develop as a rich, local practice.The ongoing erasure is guaranteed by the classification system: onlyinformation about nursing practice recognized by NIC can be coded on the formsfed into a hospital's computers or stored in a file cabinet.<p><p>Nursing informaticians agree as a body that in order for proper healthcare tobe given and for nurses to be recognized as a profession, hospitals asorganizations should code for nursing within the framework of their memorysystems: nursing work should be classified and forms should be generated whichutilize these classifications.  However, there has been disagreement withrespect to strategy.  <p><p>To understand the difference that has emerged, recall one of those forms youhave filled in (we have all experienced one) which do not allow you to say whatyou think.  You may, in a standard case, have been offered a choice of severalracial origins; but may not believe in any such categorization.  There is noroom on the form to write an essay on race identity politics.  So you eitheryou make an uncomfortable choice in order to get counted, and hope that enoughof your complexity will be preserved by your set of answers to the form; or youdon't answer the question and perhaps decide to devote some time to lobbyingthe producers of the offending form to reconsider their categorization ofpeople.  The NIC group has wrestled with the same strategic choice: fittingtheir classification system into the Procrustean bed of all the otherclassification systems that they have to articulate with in any given medicalsetting in order to form part a given organization's potential memory; orrejecting the ways in which memory is structured in the organizations that theyare dealing with.  We will now look in turn at each of these strategies.<p><p>Let us look first at the argument for including NIC within the potential memoryframework of the hospital.   They argue that NIC has to respond to multipleimportant agendas simultaneously.  Consider the following litany of needs for astandard vocabulary of nursing practice:<p>It is essential to develop a standardized nomenclature of nursing diagnoses inorder to name without ambiguity those conditions in clients that nursesidentify and treat without prescription from other disciplines; suchidentification is not possible without agreement as to the meaning of terms.Professional standards review boards require discipline-specificaccountability; some urgency in developing a discipline-specific nomenclatureis provided by the impending National Health Insurance legislation, sincedemands for accountability are likely both to increase and become morestringent following passage of the legislation.  Adoption of a standardizednomenclature of nursing diagnoses may also alleviate problems in communicationbetween nurses and members of other disciplines, and improvement ininterdisciplinary communication can only lead to improvement in patient care.Standardization of the nomenclature of nursing diagnoses will promote healthcare delivery by identifying, for legal and reimbursement purposes, theevaluation of the quality of care provided by nurses; facilitate thedevelopment of a taxonomy of nursing diagnoses; provide the element for storageand retrieval of nursing data; and facilitate the teaching of nursing byproviding content areas that are discrete, inclusive, logical, and consistent .(Castles, 1981, 38)<p>I have cited this passage at length since it unites most of the motivations forthe development of NIC.  The development of a new information infrastructurefor nursing, heralded in this passage, will make nursing more `memorable'.  Itwill also lead to a clearance of past nursing knowledge - henceforthprescientific - from the textbooks; it will lead to changes in the practice ofnursing (a redefinition of disciplinary boundaries) - a shaping of nursing sothat future practice converges on potential memory.<p><p>Many nurses and nursing informaticians are concerned that the profession itselfmay have to change too much in order to meet the requirements of theinformation infrastructure.  We murder, they note, to dissect.  In her study ofnursing information systems in France, Ina Wagner (1993)  speaks as follows ofthe gamble of computerizing nursing records:<p>Nurses might gain greater recognition for their work and more control over thedefinition of patients' problems while finding out that their practice isincreasingly shaped by the necessity to comply with regulators' and employers'definitions of 'billable categories' (Feldberg 1990).<p>Indeed, a specific feature of this 'thought world' into which nurses aregradually socialized through the use of computer systems is the integration ofmanagement criteria into the practice of nursing.  <p>She continues: AWorking with a patient classification system with time unitsassociated with each care activity enforces  a specific time discipline onnurses.  They learn to assess patients' needs in terms of working time.<ahref="forget_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a>  This analytic perspective is shared by theIowa nurses.  They argue that documentation is centrally important; it not onlyprovides a record of nursing activity but structures same: <p>While nurses complain about paperwork, they structure their care so that therequired forms get filled out.  If the forms reflect a philosophy of the nurseas a dependent assistant to the doctor who delivers technical care in afunctional manner, this is the way the nurse will act.  If the forms reflect aphilosophy of the nurse as a professional member of the health team with aunique independent function, the nurse will act accordingly.  In the future,with the implementation of price-per-case reimbursement vis-a-vis diagnosisrelated groups, documentation will become more important than ever. (Bulechekand McCloskey, 1985, 406).<p>As the NIC classification has developed, observes Joanne McCloskey, thetraditional category of `nursing process' has been replaced by `clinicaldecision making plus knowledge classification'.  And in the representation ofNIC that she produced (Diagram 5), both the patient and the nurse had droppedentirely out of the picture (both were, she said, located within the `clinicaldecision making box' on her diagram) (IIP 6/8/95).  A recent book about thenext generation nursing information system argued that the new system:<p>cannot be assembled like a patchwork quilt, by piecing together components ofexisting technologies and software programs.  Instead, the system must berebuilt on a design different from that of most approaches used today: it mustbe a data-driven rather than a process-driven system.  A dominant feature ofthe new system is its focus on the acquisition, management, processing, andpresentation of 'atomic-level' data that can be used across multiple settingsfor multiple purposes. The paradigm shift to a data-driven system represents anew generation of information technology; it provides strategic resources forclinical nursing practice, rather than just support for various nursing tasks.(Zielstorff et al., 1993, 1).<p>This speaks to the progressive denial of process and continuity through thesegmentation of nursing practice into activity units.  Many argue that in orderto `speak with' databases at a national and international level just suchsegmentation is needed.  The fear is that unless nurses can describe theirprocess this way (at the risk of losing the essence of that process in thedescription), then it will not be described at all.  They can only have thereown actions remembered at the price of having others forget, and possiblyforgetting themselves, precisely what it is that they do.<p><p>Some nursing informaticians have chosen rather to challenge the memoryframework existing in the medical organizations they deal with.  They haveadopted a Batesonian strategy of responding to the threat of the newinformation infrastructure by moving the whole argument up one level ofgenerality and trying to supplant `data-driven' categories with categories thatrecognize process on their own terms.  Thus the Iowa team pointed to the factthat women physicians often spend longer with patients than male doctors, butthey need to see patients less often as a result: they argue that just such aprocess-sensitive definition of productivity needs to argued for andimplemented in medical information systems in order that nursing work getsfairly represented (IIP 6/8/95).  They draw from their secret (becauseunrepresented) reservoir of knowledge about process in order to challenge thedata-driven models from within. <p><p>Within this strategy, the choice of allies is by no means obvious.  Since withthe development of NIC we are dealing with the creation of an informationinfrastructure, the whole question of how and what to challenge becomes verydifficult.  Scientists can only, willy nilly, deal with data as presented tothem by their information base, just as historians of previous centuries must,alas, rely on written traces.  When creating a new information infrastructurefor an old activity, questions have a habit of running away from one: atechnical issue about how to code process can become a challenge toorganizational theory (and its database).  A defense of process can become anattack on the scientific world view.  One of the chief attacks on the NICscheme has been made by a nursing informatician, Susan Grobe,  who believesthat rather than standardize nursing language computer scientists shoulddevelop natural language processing tools so that nurse narratives can beinterpreted.  Grobe argues for the abandonment of  any goal of producing: A asingle coherent account of the pattern of action and beliefs in science (Grobe,1992, 92); she goes on to say that: Aphilosophers of science have longacknowledged the value of a multiplicity of scientific views" (92).  Sheexcoriates Bulechek and McCloskey, architects of NIC, for having produced work:Aderived from the natural science view with its hierarchical structures andmutually exclusive and distinct categories. (93).   She on the other hand isdrawing from cognitive science, library science and social science (94).  Oragain, a recent paper on conceptual considerations, decision criteria andguidelines for the Nursing Minimum Data Set cited Fritjof Capra againstreductionism, Steven Jay Gould on the social embededness of scientific truthand praised Foucault for having developed a philosophical system to Agrapplewith this reality (Kritek, 1988, 24).  Nurse scientists, it is argued, Ahavebecome quite reductionistic and mechanistic in their approach to knowledgegeneration, at a time when numerous others, particularly physicists, arereversing that pattern (27).   And nursing has to find allies amongst thesephysicists:<p>Nurses who deliver care engage in a process.   It is actually the cyclic,continuous repetition of a complex process.  It is difficult, therefore, tosketch the boundaries of a discrete nursing event, a unit of service, and,therefore, a unit of analysis.  Time is clearly a central force in nursing careand nursing outcomes.  Nurses have only begun to struggle with this factor.  Ithas a centrality that eludes explication when placed in the context of quantumphysics. (Ibid., 28)<p>The point here is not whether this argument is right or wrong.  It is aninteresting position.  It can only be maintained, as can many of the otherpossible links that bristle through the NIC literature, because the informationinfrastructure itself is in flux.  When the infrastructure is not in place toprovide a `natural' hierarchy of levels, then discourses can and do makestrange connections between themselves. <p><p>In order to not be continually erased from the record, nursing informaticiansare risking either modifying their own practice (making it more data driven) orwaging a Quixotic war on database designers.   The corresponding gain is great,however.  If the infrastructure itself is designed in such a way that nursinginformation has to be present as an independent, well defined category, thennursing itself as a profession will have a much better chance of survivingthrough rounds of process re-engineering and nursing science as a disciplinewill have a firm foundation.  The infrastructure assumes the position of BishopBerkeley's God: as long as it pays attention to nurses, they will continue toexist.  Having ensured that all nursing acts are potentially remembered by anymedical organization, the NIC team will have gone a long way to ensuring thefuture of nursing.  <p><p><p><p><i>Part 2 - Classification systems: potential memory and forgetting</i><p><p><p>Three social institutions, more than any others, claim perfect memory: thesister institutions of science, the law and religion.  The legal and clericalprofessions claim perfect memory through an intricate set of reference workswhich can be consulted for precedence on any current case.  The applicabilityof past to present is a matter of constant concern: argued in the law courts orin theological disputes.  Scientific professionals, though, tend to claim thatby its very nature science displays perfect memory: and they structure theirrecall primarily through a myriad of classification systems that gives them avast reserve of potential memory (scientific articles are in principle - thoughnever of course in practice - coded in such a way that an experiment performedone day in Algeria can be entirely replicated a hundred years later inAfghanistan). We will now go on to draw some more general conclusions about theways in which classification systems structure memory within organizations,taking as a chief example the nature and operation of classification systems inscience.  There are two major reasons for choosing the institution of sciencefor our wider discussion - the NIC development team claims to be renderingnursing scientific, and so these wider examples develop naturally out of Part 1above; and classification work has been more formalized in science than inother institutions<p><p>It can readily be accepted that great discoveries were made but not recognizedas such at the time (the cases of Kepler and Mendel are canonical).  But notthat discoveries were made, recognized, and then forgotten.  Traditionally inscience the discourse of perfect memory has not been that of the file folder -though notable publications have claimed to be `archives' for their respectivedisciplines.  The more general  claim to perfect memory is that this is in thevery nature of science.  Take, for example, Henri Poincare's <u>Science andHypothesis</u> (1905).  All scientific work, for Poincare and many positivists,went towards the construction of an eternal palace.  Poincare uses the metaphorof an army of scientists, foot soldiers, each adding a brick or so to theedifice of science: AThe scientist must set in order.  Science is built up withfacts, as a house is with stones (101).  The thing about bricks is that theydon't get forgotten: they are there in the nature of the edifice.  Nobody needactively recall them: buildings don't remember.  But each brick that is in abuilding is continuously present and is therefore ageless.  In anothermetaphor, he sees the work of doing physics as similar to building a collectionof books - with the role of the theorist being to facilitate informationretrieval, to catalogue: <p>Let us compare science to a library that ought to grow continually.   Thelibrarian has at his disposal for his purchases only insufficient funds.  Heought to make an effort not to waste them.<p>It is experimental physics that is entrusted with the purchases.  It alone,then, can enrich the library.<p>As for mathematical physics, its task will be to make out the catalogue.  Ifthe catalogue is well made, the library will not be any richer, but the readerwill be helped to use its riches. (104)<p>The very nature of theory, then, is that it furnishes a classification systemwhich can then be used to remember all (and only that) which is relevant to itsassociated practice.<p><p>All classification systems, however, face a bootstrapping problem.  In a worldof imperfect knowledge, any classificatory principle might be good, valid,useful: you won't know what makes a difference until you have built up a bodyof knowledge that relies, for its units of data, on the classification schemethat you have not yet developed.  This is Spinoza's problem.  Consider its formin the world of medical record keeping - a world in which every trace mightcount.  In order to maintain a good system of medical records, a state needs toclassify a huge mount of information about not only its own citizens, but aboutcitizens of countries that it is in contact with (classification systems arenecessarily imperialistic; witness the protests of African doctors to pressuresfrom western AIDS researchers).  The need for information and thence the burdenof classificatory activity is effectively infinite.  A wish-list for a nationalmedical information system in America included the following:<p>all factors affecting health ... genetic and biological, environmental,behavioral, psychological, and social conditions which precipitate healthproblems; complaints, symptoms and diseases which prompt people to seek medicalcare; and evaluation of severity and functional capacity, including impairmentand handicaps (Rothwell, 1985, 169-170).<p>Each of these sets of factors involves a classification scheme.  There is notelling what information will be relevant: <p>to classify a chisel, a hand drill, and a spanner together as `hand tools', orthe first two as `cutting and piercing instruments' may be obscurantist, oreven misleading.  Whereas to one accident researcher it is significant that achisel is edged, a drill pointed, and a spanner neither, to another it may bemore important that the chisel is pushed, the spanner turned and the drilloperated by rotary motion.  (Heidenstrom, 1985, 76)<p>In a world in which, as Ann Fagot-Largeault (1990, 6) has pointed out, it isimpossible to die of old age (the category of being `worn out' having beenremoved from the ICD) it appears that we are afloat in a sea of multiple,fractured causalities each demanding their own classification systems - andtheir own apparatus of record collection.   To deal with the plenum ofinformation that all good organizations logically need, one can operate adistribution of memory in space (such and such a subgroup needs to hold suchand such knowledge) and a distribution of memory in time (such and such amemory will only be recalled if a given occasion arises).<p><p>Classification systems provide both a warrant and a tool for forgetting at thesame time as they operate this distribution.  To take an overview of thisprocess, let us consider the case of the classification of the sciences.Auguste Comte wrote about this in the first volume of his course of positivephilosophy, wherein he lays out a new classification of all the sciences inhierarchical order, each science having a statics and a dynamics.  He arguedthat it was only at the current state of advancement of science that a trueclassification system could emerge: since only now were the forces of religionand metaphysics sufficiently at bay that a true picture of the nature ofknowledge could emerge.  At the same time, the sum total of scientificknowledge was sufficiently great that it was inconceivable to learn a scienceby tracing its history: there were too many wrong turns, blind allies,vagaries.  (Just, one might note, as one does not want to remember where one'skeys are by tracing the series of actions that one has made in the past severalhours).  With the new classification system, knowledge could be arrayedlogically and naturally - one would lose chronological order but gaincoherence.  Indeed, only in this way could science be logically taught; indeed:A... the most important property of our encyclopedic formulation ... is that itdirectly gives rise the true general plan of an entirely rational scientificeducation. (Comte, 1975 [1830-45], 50)<a href="forget_fn.html#fn0">[4]</a>What is left, in Comte's work, is the positivist calendar, where certain greatscientists have their days, just as the saints had theirs in the age ofreligion.  Serres annotates this passage with the observation that theformation (training) of scientists covers up and hides the formation(production) of scientific knowledge (51).  <p><p>Indeed Comte sets in train a double motion.  On the one hand, you will onlylearn science if you forget its history; on the other hand, you will onlyunderstand the history of science if you look at the entire history ofhumanity: <p>This vast chain is so real that often, in order to understand the effectivegeneration of a scientific theory, the mind is led to consider theperfectioning of some art with which it has no rational link, or even someparticular progress in social organization without which this discovery wouldnot have taken place. ... It follows therefore that one cannot know the truehistory of any science, that is to say the real formation of the discoveries itis composed of, without studying, in a general and direct manner, the historyof humanity. (52)<p>On the one side we have the complete history of humanity, where nothing can beforgotten because everything might be relevant; and on the other an efficientclassification system which allows us to remember only what we need to rememberabout science.  The classification system operates a clearance, in that allthat was religious and metaphysical is wiped away with a single gesture; itoperates selective erasure in that even in the current scientific age theprocesses of the production of knowledge will have to be erased from theaccount of the knowledge itself.  The classification system tells you what toforget and how to forget it.  It operates a double distribution in space ofscientific memory.  Firstly, the social story of science will be excluded fromthe organization of the sciences, and held outside of it (if at all) byhistorians.  This is a form of erasure.  Secondly, it offers a naturallyhierarchy of the sciences, saying that a given discipline (say geology,statics) will need to remember all and only a given set of facts about theworld.  It also operates a distribution in time, saying that all scientificproblems can be progressively unfolded - so that at one point along the path intreating a social problem you will need to draw on biology, then chemistry,then physics, then mathematics: each type of memory which has been distributedin space will also be sequenced in time.  The plenum is contained by theoverarching organization constituted by the scientific community preciselythrough a controlled program of first clearance then continuing erasure.  Thework of conjuring the world into computable form (cf Hutchins, 1995) hasalready been begun by the setting up of a certain kind of formal memory system- for example, one in which facts can be stored in linear time and space.<p><p>In the history of science, we frequently encounter an apposition betweenclearance, the deliberate destruction of the past, and establishment of aclassification system.  When Lavoisier set out to found the new discipline ofchemistry, he wrote a textbook which standardized the names of the elements (sothat Ag became silver: not Diane's metal, a name that 'remembered' thealchemical prehistory of the discipline).    He also rewrote the history ofchemistry so that his rivals, arguing the theory of affinities, no longeroccupied a place in the textbooks: they were written out of the historicalrecord. (Bensaude-Vincent, 1989).  <p><p>The strategy of clearance is a complete wiping clean of the slate, so that onecan start anew as if nothing had ever happened.  As in the example of theburning of the books, it is doubtful if clearance can ever work in the shortterm since people do remember things and institutional arrangements do beartraces of their past - as in the case of an outmoded classifcation system beingreflected in the arrangements of artifacts in a museum; however in the longterm, by the time that the curricula have been redesigned, the manualsrewritten and new nursing information systems produced it can be a highlyeffective tool.  Clearance is a pragmatic strategy: it may well be the casethat a given organizational routine or piece of knowledge has roots in thedistant past, and yet it may also be the case that dealing with said routine orknowledge it is easier to act  as if it had just arrived on the scene.  It isfor this reason that the issue of truth or falsity of memory can be a redherring in treatments of organizational memory as well as analyticallyundecidable: a false memory, well constructed through a program of forgetting,can be of great use.<p><p>Erasure is a key dimension of classification work in all organizations.  Thereis a famous passage in the Sherlock Holmes stories where Watson informs Holmesthat the earth circles the sun; Holmes politely thanks Watson and then remarksthat he will try to forget this fact as soon as possible, since it is a kind offact that cannot possibly be relevant to the task that is ever at hand for him:the solution of crime.   In scientific organizations, things get deliberatelyforgotten in a variety of ways.  They classify away traces that they know to berelevant but which should not be officially recorded.  For example, when Ilooked at the early archives of the <i>Schlumberger</i> company, I was struckby a change in the written traces being left of company activity.  In the earlydays the boxes contained a series of highly detailed reports of daily activitysent by engineers in the field across the world to the company's center ofcalculation, to borrow Callon's felicitous phrase, in Paris (Callon, 1986).The theory, explicitly stated, was the company needed the best possible recordsof what went on in the field in order to build up a sufficiently large databaseso as to construct scientific knowledge, and so as to co-ordinate strategiesfor the insertion of the company into the oil field environment.  Then one daythings changed.  Detailed accounts in French of work practice became sketchytables in English of numbers of oil wells logged.  What had happened?  Thecompany had gotten involved in a legal suit with <i>Halliburton</i> and hadcome to realize that its own internal traces of activity were open to potentialscrutiny by US courts determining patent claims.  There were two simultaneousrealizations: first the records should be in English, since the French languagecould be read by a Southern court as a foreign code; and secondly the recordsshould only contain kinds of facts that leant weight to the company's officialpresentation of itself: that is to say the cycle of accumulation of messyhalf-truths should be carried out elsewhere than in the organization's ownpotential memory system (Bowker, 1994, Chapter 3).  This strategy ofdistributed erasure is more punctillist than that of clearance: it involves thesystematic and deliberate forgetting of some actions in order to betterremember others.  In Adrienne Rich's words, this is an act of silence (AThetechnology of silence/The rituals, etiquette/the blurring of terms/silence notabsence ... Silence can be a plan/rigorously executed (Rich, 1978,17)).<i></i><p><i></i><p>Classification systems subtending information infrastructures operate as toolsof forgetting (without representation in the medical informatics infrastructurethe profession of nursing is progressively erased from the annals both ofhistory and of science).  They also operate as tools for delegating attention(Latour, 1996 has an extended discussion of this sense of delegation).  Nursesdo not want to have to carry around in their heads what drugs the patients ontheir wards need to be taking and when: they either use written traces orelectronic means to hold the memory and perhaps automatically remind them(either directly by commanding attention through a beeping sound or routinelyby constituting distributed traces that the nurse will encounter on theirnormal rounds - for example the canonical chart at the foot of the patient'sbed).  The storage of information in a section of an organization's permanentrecord guarantees that heedful attention (Weick, 1993)  is paid to thatinformation in either the production of organizational knowledge (formalaccounts of how the organization works) or the organization's production ofknowledge (how the hospital, say, contributes to the production of nursingknowledge).<p><p>In order to produce nursing (and other) knowledge, then, various kinds offorgetting need to be operated on the permanent record held by organizations.This suggestion is fully complementary to the results from science studies andorganization theory that many significant memories are held outside of formalinformation infrastructures.  Ravetz (1971), Latour (1987) and many others havenoted that one cannot do scientific work without being able to draw oninformation about specific local, organizational details of the operation of agiven laboratory; and yet that information is nowhere systematically stored.In a series of studies of Xerox technicians, Julian Orr has shown that formalrepresentations of fault diagnosis is often, on the spot, supplemented andindeed replaced by the swapping of war stories (`I had a machine that didsomething like that...' and so forth).  I do not go into the preservation ofnursing stories - which Julian Orr's work (e.g. Orr, 1990) and others' assuresus will be generated alongside of and as a complement to formal representationsof nursing work.  Further, new information infrastructures such as a hospitalinformation system adopting NIC will in fact retain traces of organizationalwork and will despite themselves allow for the sharing of organizationalmemory.  Later work by Star and myself will develop the concept oforganizational repression (by analogy to repressed memories) to discuss this.The argument comes down to asking not only what gets coded in but what getsread out of a given scheme (for example for the latter, who learns what fromthe fact that the coding book always falls open on a given page? - cf Brown andDuguid, 1994 on the importance of such peripheral clues).  However, just asoral history is a significant form of community memory, it is a different kindof memory (dates are far less important, stories migrate between characters andso forth - see Vansina, 1961) from that retained in the written record.  Myemphasis in this paper has been purely on the nature and articulation of whatgoes down in the continuing formal record that the organization preserves ofits own past activity.  This latter area is interesting in its own rightbecause it is by using these memories that transportable formal accounts usedin law, science, management will be constructed.<p><p><p><p><i>Conclusion</i><p>Information, in Bateson's famous definition, is about differences that make adifference.  Designers of classification schemes constantly have to decide whatreally does make a difference; along the way they develop an economy ofknowledge which articulates clearance and erasure and ensures that all and onlyrelevant features of the object (a disease, a body, a nursing intervention)being classified are remembered - for in this case the classification systemcan be incorporated into an information infrastructure that is delegated therole of paying due attention. A corollary of the `if it moves, count it' theoryis the proposition `if you can't see it moving, forget it'.  The nurses welooked at tried to guarantee that they won't be forgotten (wiped from therecord) by insisting that the information infrastructure pay due attention totheir activities.<p><p>In this paper, I have argued that here may indeed be good organizationalreasons for forgetting.  I have also argued that the ways in which things getforgotten are not merely images in a glass darkly of the way things getremembered; rather they are positive phenomena worthy of study in their ownright.  I have discussed two kinds of forgetting: clearance and erasure.   Fromthis emerged a consideration of forgetting and potential memory (mediated byclassification systems).<p><p>I have stressed that representation in the formal record is not the only way tobe remembered: indeed there is a complex ecology of memory practices within anyone organization.  However, the shift into long-term memory that theinfrastructure provides is significant, if fraught.  The production oftransportable knowledge used in other registers (scientific texts, the law) atpresent assumes that this knowledge can be stored and expressed in a quiterestricted range of genres.  At the limit, as we saw with Poincare, it can beargued that scientific theory is about the storage of information in suchlong-term memory.  In order to prevent continuing erasure within hospitalinformation systems, nurses have had to operate a clearance of their own past(recorded history begins today).  The prize before their eyes is a science anda profession; the danger oblivion (either being definitively excluded fromongoing information practices and thus relegated to an adjunct role or beingincluded but then distributed through re-engineering).<p><p>There is much to be done to understand the processes of commemoration, memory,history and recall in organizations.  Organizational forgetting andorganizational memory are useful concepts here because they allow us to moveflexibly between the formal and the informal, the material and the conceptual.Designers of information superhighways need to take the occasional stroll downmemory lane.<p><b>References:</b><p><b></b><p><b></b>Abbott, A.
