</PRE><HR><PRE>
Thanks for the reply on triangulation, David.

I did a search on Pick's theorem, which landed me on your geometry
junkyard, but didn't answer the question, so let me ask you this. 

Is there an analog of Pick's theorem in 3D? 

In 2D, the theorem says the area of a simple polygon with b boundary
lattice points and i interior lattice points is i + b/2 -1. One can ask
the question about the volume of a lattice non-convex polyhedron. Is there
a relation between volume and the quantities i and b? I would guess may be
not, but haven't seen anything about it... 

thanks.

Simple example: consider the tetrahedra formed by points (0,0,0) (1,0,0)
(0,1,0) (1,1,k).  Volume is k/6, each has four corners at grid points
and no other boundary or interior grid points.

Thanks. You are a great counterexample oracle!

May be you should link this to Pick's theorem page...

&gt; &gt; |Pick's theorem is that the area of a lattice polygon
&gt; &gt; |without holes is  #points inside + 1/2(#points on boundary) - 1.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; also add that the formula can be extended to polygons with multiple
&gt; holes and connected components, but not in an obvious way to 3-dim
&gt; For a tetrahedron the volume is not determined by the number of  
&gt; lattice points in the interior, faces, vertices and edges.

There are some beautiful higher-dimensional extensions of Pick's formula
based upon recent deep work in combinatorial algebraic geometry, in
particular around toric varieties, with contributions by Brion, Cappell,
Khovanskii, Morelli, Pommersheim, Shaneson, etc.  For a readable
introduction see Morelli's paper [1], and [2] for an online start.

A sort of, yes! Generalizations of Pick's theorem were delivered by Reeve
(for the 3-dimensional case) and Macdonald (in general). See:
1. I. G. Macdonald, The Volume of a lattice polyhedron, Proc. Camb. Phil.
Soc. 59 (1963), 719-726.
2. J. E. Reeve, On the volume of lattice polyhedra, Proc. London Math. Soc.
(3), 7 (1957), 378-395.

&gt; Can a variation of Pick's theorem be applied to the volume of a polyhedron?
