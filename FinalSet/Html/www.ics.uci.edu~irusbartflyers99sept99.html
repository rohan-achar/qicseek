At FX Palo Alto Laboratory, meetings and presentations are conducted
in a conference room outfitted with several video cameras. Digital
videos of these events are collected in a video library that serves
as a corporate memory. In such a large collection of digitized videos,
it is often difficult to find both the appropriate video file and the
portion of the video that is of interest. We have developed a Web-based
video browser that graphically presents information about the contents
of each video and includes a number of aids that facilitate browsing
and navigating the video. A media player is tightly integrated with the
browser for playback from any point in the video. We want to support the
access to our video collection without manual preparation work such as
manual transcription and/or speaker identification. Therefore, we use
a number of automatic techniques that provide indices into the video
material and interfaces that allow users to browse video using those
indices. In this talk, I will describe the techniques for automatically
identifying interesting segments and demonstrate the user aids for
navigating the videos and the automatically generated video summaries
based on these techniques. The system has been in constant use for
almost
two years and has been evaluated in a user study.

<strong>Biography:</strong>

Dr. Andreas Girgensohn is a Senior Research Scientist at FX Palo Alto 
Laboratory, Palo Alto, California. He has been developing tools
to support developers and end users. In the last four years, this effort
has been directed in the area of using the Web to design and develop
collaborative applications. At FX Palo Alto Laboratory, he is working
on Web-based video indexing and corporate memory applications. Prior to
that, he worked at NYNEX Science & Technology (now Bell Atlantic) on
task-oriented user interface design and development, on support for
software developers, and on tools for improving communication and
collaboration using the World Wide Web and Lotus Notes. Dr. Girgensohn
has delivered papers and tutorials on collaborative applications and
innovative user interaction techniques at a number of conferences,
including CHI `97 and `98, CSCW `96 and `98, GROUP `97, Hypertext `96,
Interact `95, and WWW6. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from
the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 1992, and his Masters in
Computer Science from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 1987.

<p>

Coordinating work between many groups is an important issue for many
complex tasks. While awareness tools are commonly used to enhance 
coordination within a group, we will present an approach that 
creates awareness to enhance coordination between groups. By using a 
push technology, we create an awareness of information generated by 
different work groups. This helps workers stay aware of issues and 
decisions made by other groups that could affect their work. We will
present the Knowledge Depot group memory and Subscription Service, and
compare it to other approaches for creating awareness between groups.

<strong>Biography:</strong>

Michael Kantor is a Ph.D. student in Information and Computer Science at
the University of California, Irvine.  He received his M.S. in Computer 
Science from the University of California, Irvine in 1997, and his B.S 
in Computer Engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle in 
1994. He has research interests in user interfaces and computer mediated
communication. He has built a number of web and Lotus notes based 
groupware systems for Bell Atlantic and studied their use and impact 
upon the user groups.
