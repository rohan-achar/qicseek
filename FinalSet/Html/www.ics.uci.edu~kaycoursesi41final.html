<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style" SIZE=6><B>Final Exam Details</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">As originally scheduled and announced on the
syllabus, our final exam will be on Tuesday, December 6, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
in our regular   classroom.  It will cover the whole
course (emphasizing topics from class, from the assignments, and from the
quizzes, and not emphasizing other material from the textbook).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">You may bring with you to the exam one page
of notes (8 1/2 by 11 inches, both sides), on which you may place any information
you think will help you on the exam.  Computer-printed pages are fine. 
You may not bring any electronic devices aside from a conventional digital
wristwatch.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">One excellent way to review, as we&#39;ve mentioned
before, is to go back and retake the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/quiz/old/">quizzes</A>.
 They&#39;re all available on line, or will be shortly.  You should also
go back, read, and make sure you can do all the problems from the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/index.html">homework and lab assignments</A>,
especially the ones that don&#39;t come from the textbook.  (You&#39;re
not responsible for knowing how to do file handling in
Scheme or for knowing how to use the Picturing Programs teachpack.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">There is also a set of <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/questions.html">additional questions</A>,
including some longer ones of the sort that couldn&#39;t fit on a quiz but
might show up on the final.  There are also <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/answers.html">answers</A>
available in a separate document, but once more we urge you to work out
the problems as fully as you can before you consult the answers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We will have a review session on Monday, December 5, from 1:00 to 2:50 p.m. in 
room 1300 Donald Bren Hall. <!-- room 1420 Donald Bren Hall. [Access to this room is a little tricky; it's from the <em>outside</em> of the building on the west side, adjacent to the University Club.] --><!--
on Monday, December
8, from 11:30 to 1:30 in Engineering Tower 202.  
-->
The price of admission  is (at least) one
written question about the course material.  The best strategy would be
to go through all the materials suggested on this page before the review
session, so you can bring any unresolved questions to the review session
itself.  We also recommend a good night&#39;s sleep before the exam.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Finally, below is a tentative, rough list of the topics
we covered apart from the <em>Picturing Programs</em> textbook and other programming topics.  Approximately 25% of the final
will address these topics.  The questions will tend towards larger concepts
and away from small detail-level memorization.  We will supply a copy of
the Deus X instruction set with the final exam, as we did with one of the
quizzes, so you don&#39;t have to devote any of your page of notes to that.</FONT></P>
