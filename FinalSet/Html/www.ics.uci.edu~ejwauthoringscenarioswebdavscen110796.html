<H2><A NAME="toc-intro"></A>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>The purpose of this document is to catalog scenarios of distributed
editing and authoring as well as versioning, as related to the Interned
Draft document &quot;Requirements on HTTP for Distributed Content Editing&quot;
[<A HREF="#req-doc">1</A>]. These scenarios can serve as examples of distributed
authoring HTTP&nbsp;extensions' usage, and can be used as basis for discussion
of various requirements and protocol features.</P>

<P>The scenarios in this document have been divided into sections addressing
different aspects of the distributed authoring area: the first section
focuses on the manipulation of the <I>contents</I> of resources (documents),
the second section focuses on the management of the documents themselves
and their relationships to other documents and the URL space. A section
has also been included for scenarios involving versioning, although these
may overlap with the aforementioned two sections.</P>

<P>In version 0.3 the section on locking (which was empty) has been eliminated,
and a section has been included containing scenarios directly related to
the forthcoming RFC on distributed authoring and versioning.</P>

<P>[<I>Comments are requested regarding new or existing scenarios and document
format. Please send them to the <A HREF="mailto:lassila@w3.org">author</A>.</I>]</P>

<H2><A NAME="toc-dist-edit"></A>2. Scenarios of Distributed Editing</H2>

<P>This section contains scenarios where contents of resources are changed
through the use of HTTP (as opposed to through local file system operations).</P>

<H3>2.1. Editing HTML</H3>

<P>Jane, the maintainer of a web page, needs to update its HTML source.
There are no other variants to this page, such as translations into other
languages. She is working with a distributed authoring tool, DistEdit.
She loads the HTML source into DistEdit via HTTP. She then performs some
edits to the HTML source. The HTML source is then written back to its original
URL using HTTP. The distributed editing session is ended.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements (see [<A HREF="#req-doc">1</A>]) and/or protocol
features: </B>1 (Source Retrieval), HTTP&nbsp;PUT, 10 (Partial Write).</P>

<H3>2.2. Editing a Particular Language Version of an HTML Resource</H3>

<P>Jane, who is fluent in French, needs to update the HTML source of the
French language variant of a web page which has English, French, and German
language variants. She is working with a distributed authoring tool, DistEdit.
She loads the French language HTML source into DistEdit using HTTP, and
makes some corrections and modifications. She then writes the HTML source
back to the original URL using HTTP. The distributed editing session is
ended.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>1 (Source Retrieval),
HTTP&nbsp;PUT, 10 (Partial Write).</P>

<H3>2.3. Editing HTML with Server Side Includes</H3>

<P>Jane needs to update the HTML source of a web page. The HTML source
includes a server side include (SSI) directive which instructs the HTTP
server to insert the current date into the document, and is written in
English. There are no other variants to this page, such as translations
into other languages. Jane is working with a distributed authoring tool,
DistEdit. She loads the HTML source (including the source of the server
side include directive) into DistEdit via HTTP. She then performs some
edits to the HTML source. The HTML source is then written back to its original
URL using HTTP. The distributed editing session is ended.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>1 (Source Retrieval),
HTTP&nbsp;PUT, 10 (Partial Write).</P>

<H3>2.4. Editing Word Processor Source which Gets Converted to HTML</H3>

<P>Jane needs to update the source of a web page, stored in the native
format of the HTTP-aware word processor DistProc. The HTTP server containing
this resource has extensions provided by the vendor of DistProc which automatically
convert the DistProc native files into HTML which is served whenever the
web page is accessed from its URL, U. The web page does not include any
graphic content, and is written in English. She loads the web page source
into DistProc from URL U using HTTP, and begins to edit this DistProc native
format source file. After making some modifications, she saves the source
file back to the original URL, U, using HTTP. She then checks the HTML
source by retrieving URL U using their favorite web browser. Since it looks
fine, she ends the distributed editing session.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>1 (Source Retrieval),
HTTP&nbsp;PUT.</P>

<H2><A NAME="toc-dist-doc-mgmt"></A>3. Scenarios of Distributed Document
Management</H2>

<P>Scenarios in this section describe remote management of the properties
of resources, remote management of URL hierarchies (aka &quot;directories&quot;),
as well as visualization of the relationships among graphs.</P>

<H3>3.1. Creating a New Resource</H3>

<P>Jane is working with distributed authoring tool DistEdit on a new HTML
page which does not contain any embedded graphical content. She has finished
her edits, and saves the HTML resource to a web server using the HTTP protocol.
She is prompted for a URL for the new document; the page is then written
to this URL using the HTTP &quot;PUT&quot; method.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>HTTP&nbsp;PUT.</P>

<H3>3.2. Creating a New Resource through a &quot;Save As&quot; Dialog Box&quot;</H3>

<P>Jane is working with distributed authoring tool DistEdit on a new HTML
page which does not contain any embedded graphical content. She has finished
her edits, and wishes to save the HTML resource to a web server using the
HTTP protocol, but does not know the exact name of the level of the URL
hierarchy where she wants the document to be stored. She invokes the &quot;Save
As...&quot; feature of DistEdit, which includes a <I>hierarchy level viewer</I>,
a list of all the entities and their MIME types at a specific level of
the hierarchy, along with the ability to go up or down a level of the hierarchy
by clicking on either &quot;..&quot; to go up, or the name of a hierarchy
level to go down. She moves up and down within the URL hierarchy using
the facilities of the hierarchy level viewer, finally finding a good hierarchy
level for the resource. She then enters a name for the HTML resource, and
hits the &quot;Save&quot; button. The DistEdit tool now writes the HTML
page to the URL created by combining the hierarchy level selected using
the hierarchy level viewer, and the name just entered by her. The web page
is written to the URL using the HTTP &quot;PUT&quot; method.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.aolpress.com/press/index.html">AOLpress</A>
distributed authoring tool currently provides this capability, which they
term &quot;Network saving of HTML pages&quot; using the &quot;AOLpress
file dialog.&quot;</LI>

<LI>For file-based servers, there is typically a mapping between URL hierarchy
levels and directories in the filesystem.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>12 (List URL&nbsp;Hierarchy
Level), HTTP&nbsp;PUT.</P>

<H3>3.3. Creating a New Resource in a New Hierarchy Level</H3>

<P>Jane is working with distributed authoring tool DistEdit on a new HTML
page which contains some associated embedded graphical content. She finishes
her edits, and wishes to save the HTML resource to a web server using the
HTTP protocol, as well as save the graphical images (collectively we will
call this <I>publishing</I>). She invokes the publishing feature of DistEdit,
which includes the hierarchy level viewer (as described in the previous
scenario). She finds a level of the hierarchy using the hierarchy viewer,
but since this is a new web, she decides to create a new level of the hierarchy
just to contain this web. Pressing the &quot;Create New Hierarchy&quot;
button causes the author to be queried for the name of the new hierarchy
level. Once entered, DistEdit informs the HTTP server that a new hierarchy
level should be added below the level currently displayed in the hierarchy
level viewer. If the author has the correct access permissions to create
a new hierarchy, the new hierarchy level is created. The web author then
presses the &quot;Publish&quot; button, and his web of HTML and graphic
entities are written to the HTTP server.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.aolpress.com/press/index.html">AOLpress</A>
distributed authoring tool currently provides the capability to make new
hierarchy levels, supported by their &quot;MKDIR&quot; HTTP method.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>12 (List URL&nbsp;Hierarchy
Level), 13 (Make URL Hierachy Level), HTTP&nbsp;PUT.</P>

<H3>3.4. Visualizing Webs as Graphs</H3>

<P>In order to understand the link structure and resource inclusion relationships
at a hierarchy level, a web maintainer chooses the &quot;Graph View&quot;
option of their distributed editing tool DistEdit. DistEdit queries the
web maintainer for which level of the hierarchy to display using a graph
visualization, and then uses the HTTP protocol to read information about
that level of the hierarchy. DistEdit uses this information to display
a graphical visualization of the hierarchy level, including an icon for
each resource, solid lines between the icons representing links, and dashed
lines representing inclusion (for example, images loaded using the IMG
tag). Entities the web maintainer has read and write access to are displayed
in green, those which they have read access to are in white, and those
which they have no access to are in red. To create the graph visualization,
DistEdit must, using HTTP, get a listing of all the entities at a level
of the hierarchy, and their access control permissions.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.aolpress.com/press/index.html">AOLpress</A>
distributed authoring tool currently provides a similar capability, which
they term the &quot;MiniWeb,&quot; a &quot;bird's-eye&quot; graphical view
of web site documents and how they are linked together.</LI>

<LI>The FrontPage distributed authoring tool provides equivalent capability,
which they call a &quot;Link View,&quot; and also supports the related
&quot;Outline View&quot; and &quot;Summary View.&quot;</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>12 (List URL&nbsp;Hierarchy
Level).</P>

<H3>3.5. Modifying Access Rights</H3>

<P><B>Realistic.</B> A sales manager at a company which contains an organization-wide
intranet is working with an intranet-enabled spreadsheet program, DistCalc.
After entering the sales figures for the previous month (which are below
projections), a graph of the sales figures is generated as a JPEG image,
and then saved to the departmental HTTP server using the HTTP &quot;PUT&quot;
method. Realizing that it might be best to limit access to this information,
in their web browser they bring up the graph image. After selecting the
menu option, &quot;Modify Access Permissions,&quot; the browser displays
the access control page for the graph image resource. The sales manager
uses the (server-specific) facilities on this page to modify the sales
chart's access control rights so it is password protected.</P>

<P><B>Ideal.</B> In the ideal case, the DistCalc program would display
a dialog box asking the user for what access rights the graph resource
should have <I>before</I> the graph is saved to the departmental HTTP server.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The &quot;realistic&quot; case assumes that reaching consensus on an
access control standard for HTTP resources is not achievable in the near
term, and hence access control will vary with server type. It also assumes
a continuation of the current trend of having an access control URL for
each resource. The &quot;ideal&quot; case shows what could be achieved
if an HTTP access control standard is created.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>No matching requirements or protocol features.</B></P>

<H3>3.6. Copying Documents</H3>

<P>Jane is looking at the list of monthly reports available on the server.
She selects one from the list that she wants to use as the basis for a
new monthly report. She asks for a copy of this monthly report to be made
in the same directory but with a different name. Since she is not intending
to work on it now, there is no reason to pull the content to the client.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>14 (Copy).</P>

<H3>3.8. Modifying/Setting Document Attributes</H3>

<P>Jane is creating a new document on the Web. She sends it to the server,
but also wants to set a bunch of attributes that can be used later in searches
(author, title, document type, subject, organization, etc.). Sometimes
she may also want to create catalog entries for documents that are not
available in electronic form. There will be no content for these documents,
just attributes.</P>

<P><B>Relevant requirements and/or protocol features: </B>11 (Attributes).</P>

<H2><A NAME="toc-doc-lock"></A>4. Scenarios Directly Related to Forthcoming
DAV RFC</H2>

<P>[ <I>This section contains scenarios directly related to the current
draft of the forthcoming RFC on distributed authoring and versioning. Eventually,
these scenarios will become the entire scenario document and will replace
scenarios in the other sections. For now, they have been included separately.
Most of this section is taken directly from Del Jensen's (Novell) message
to the DAV mailing list; scenario notes are his. OL</I> ]</P>

<H3>4.1. Scenarios for Transactions to OPEN a Document Container.</H3>

<P><B>Scenario A: </B>A person, agent or thing, PAT, requests that repository
R (a web, a DMS store, etc.) be opened. The server response to PAT establishes
context for R; for example, a list of R attributes and corresponding attribute
values, followed by a list cataloging the objects immediately subordinate
to R (folders, files, pages, whatever). Variation 1: PAT requests by location
(URL). Variation 2: PAT requests by identity (URI).</P>

<P><B>Scenario B: </B>PAT requests that file F (containing document D)
be opened. The server response to PAT establishes context for F; for example
a &quot;reference handle&quot; for accessing the attributes and content
of F.</P>

<P><B>Scenario C: </B>PAT opens folder S. In response, PAT receives context
for S. Just after PAT's OPEN request PAT2 initiates a MOVE of S.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>A semantic problem: how does PAT understand the object-context response
of the OPEN well enough to make use of it?</LI>

<LI>The need to support URI's as well as URL's. We should keep a close
eye on the URI/URC work groups (see URI specification RFC1630, and see
also <A HREF="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/uri.html">http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/uri.html</A>).</LI>

<LI>The issue of locking resources. In scenario C, suppose PAT opens S
in something like a &quot;share deny none&quot; mode. What might happen?
a) The server might reject PAT2's MOVE request. b) The server might honor
PAT2's MOVE request and &quot;shadow&quot; the old URL for S until there
is no pending operation or unresolved state with respect to S via the shadow
URL. c) The server might honor PAT2's MOVE request and do nothing about
pending operations or unresolved states with respect to S via the orphaned
URL.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.2. Scenarios for Transactions to CLOSE a Document Container</H3>

<P><B>Scenario A: </B>PAT, having examined the list of container attributes
for folder S, uses an editing tool in order to change the value V1 of the
attribute A to V2. The new attribute value has local instantiation at the
remote host(s) which are providing an environment for PAT's editing tool.
The (server side) object S itself does not yet reflect V2 at A. Through
some action, either explicitly (such as requesting a &quot;close&quot;
transaction with S) or implicitly (such as ending the edit session) PAT
asks for closure with S. Variation 1: A second party PAT2 has meanwhile
requested to PUT a value to A. Variation 2: At the time of PATs CLOSE request,
PAT is disconnected from the network.</P>

<P><B>Scenario B: </B>PAT has opened folder S and requested that all objects
in S not accessed within the last six months be deleted. Before the deletion
is complete, PAT requests closure with the repository R containing S.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The problem of encountering a race condition is the explicit issue
raised by Scenario A. But there is also the implicit issue of providing
a common sematic space for PAT's editing environment and the server-side
DMS. In this case it would be nice if PAT's environment had lexicological
connection with A, i.e., could ascertain how the value of A is represented
(data type, range, etc.). Semantic problems such as these are often resolved
by promoting standard formats for the transport container. Will the work
group get involved with format issues?</LI>

<LI>Scenario B illustrates an obvious closure issue, to wit: all ongoing
processes and unresolved state conditions that are artifacts of the interaction
between PAT, S and R must be &quot;cleanly&quot; terminated and resolved
before closure. Usually.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.3. Scenarios for Transactions to DELETE a Document Container</H3>

<P><B>Scenario A: </B>PAT opens folder S and examines its content. PAT
decides to delete all non-folder objects in S, but is unsure if existing
folders subordinate to S have valuable content. PAT directs that all non-folder
objects in S be deleted.</P>

<P><B>Scenario B: </B>PAT directs that folder S and all subordinate folders
and content be deleted. A document subordinate to S is currently open to
PAT2.</P>

<P><B>Scenario C: </B>PAT directs that file F containing document D be
deleted. A copy process of D to some other repository is in progress.</P>

<P><B>Scenario D: </B>PAT directs that all containers and related content
subordinate to folder S with content that has not been modified since a
given date (supplied by PAT or otherwise provided) be deleted. One or more
active documents in the repository reference a common header that is in
a file F subordinate to S. F meets the delete criterion.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The delete might need to act within the context of query results on
container/content attributes as well as scope conditions on the store hierarchy.</LI>

<LI>B and C show how &quot;locking&quot; might be a good thing.</LI>

<LI>D illustrates how someone might wish to incorporate a &quot;reference
count&quot; attribute on linked objects, and desire that reference count
values be appropriately factored into the query/scope constraints for certain
kinds of transactions.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.4. Scenarios for Transactions to UNDELETE a Document Container</H3>

<P>Container S1 (subordinate to S) and all subordinate containers have
been deleted. PAT requests that container S3 and all subordinate objects
be undeleted, where S3 was subordinate to S2 which in turn was subordinate
to S1. Variation 1: The container structure is &quot;plex&quot;, so that
S3 was also subordinate to Sk which was not subordinate to S1.</P>

<H3>4.5. Scenarios for Transactions to COPY a Document Container.</H3>

<P><B>Scenario A: </B>PAT directs that folder S1 be copied to folder S2.
While the copy is in progress, PAT2 directs that S1 be moved to folder
S3.</P>

<P><B>Scenario B: </B>PAT directs that a container Fbe copied to a location
outside the repository R. Although F contains only a simple text document,
the structure of F both as a logical and a physical entity is highly idiosyncratic,
being intimately bound to R. Consequently, F cannot be expressed in the
external domain. Variation 1: The DMS has export capability (to the external
file system) with a granularity that can resolve F. Variation 2: The document
contained by F has a native format corresponding to the tool used to generate
the document (HTML , WPD, etc.). In this case one could interpret the copy
as a transform from Fin the DMS domain to the native document format D
in the external domain. Variation 3: The container to be copied is folder-like,
i.e. a proper container, and the container hierarchy in R is compatible
with the external domain container hierarchy. In this case, some kind of
copy/transform could be implemented, with the understanding that container
attributes might be largely distorted or lost.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>Copying within R should be no big deal, though scenario 6a does illustrate
why one might desire some kind of &quot;read-lock&quot; mechanism. As scenario
B illustrates, copying container structure and content from one repository
to another can be problematical. For example: how does one, in general,
map a plex container model to a hierarchical model?</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.6. Scenarios for Transactions to MOVE a Document Container</H3>

<P><B>Scenario A: </B>PAT directs that folder S1 be moved to folder S2.
In the container hierarchy, S2 is subordinate to S1.</P>

<P><B>Scenario B: </B>PAT directs that container S1 be moved to container
S2. There exists in web W a page P that is external to S which makes (forward)
reference (via URI) to one or more objects in S.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>Again we see in the second scenario why it might be desirable to support
the URI initiative.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.7. Scenarios for Transactions to OPEN a Document</H3>

<P><B>Scenario A: </B>PAT requests that document D be opened. D is available
in English, German and Swedish, each using different word processors and
each with different revision histories.</P>

<P><B>Scenario B: </B>PAT requests that document D be opened. D contains
links to headers, footers and graphical material. Variation 1: PAT's client
side environment is a browser. Variation 2: PAT's client side environment
is an editor.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>In both scenarios it is important that source entities have meta-data
identifying both the native (or &quot;source&quot;) format (MS Word, Corel
WP, etc.) and format revision.</LI>

<LI>Scenario B also illustrates the possible desirability of server-side
support for conversion of document source to a normal (canonical) form
(such as HTML/MIME) for viewer/browser support. A typical DMS might, upon
receipt of the OPEN request, retrieve the document meta-data and content
from the store and create a temporary file containing the document content
in its native format (such as Microsoft Word) on the system(s) hosting
the store. The DMS would then respond (via the server) with status, the
URL of the temporary file and the document meta-data (establishing context
for the document object). The client-side process might then issue a GET
request for either the source document (for editing), or the normal form
document (for viewing). Though one might expect that editing source implies
GETting source, one must not rule out the possibility of editing the (temporary)
source file in-situ (server side); editing server side in-situ is one plausible
approach to collaborative editing. While the Extension may not initially
support collaborative editing of a single document, the Extension architecture
should neither proscribe such functionality nor should it favor the adoption
of any one particular implementation architecture.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.8. Scenarios for Document CHECK IN and CHECK OUT Transactions to
a Repository</H3>

<P>PAT &quot;checks out&quot; a document D with an &quot;intent to edit&quot;
(i.e., a high probability that PAT will delete, add-to or change document
content or document meta-data). Variation 1: PAT wants exclusive editing
rights (&quot;write lock&quot;) to D. PAT has no objection to letting others
view as it is edited. Variation 2: PAT wants exclusive editing rights D
and PATobjects to others viewing D as it is edited (&quot;read/write lock&quot;).
Variation 3: PAT wants to edit a local copy of D with the intent to merge
and resolve conflicts later at &quot;check in&quot;. Note that this case
accomodates editing &quot;off-line&quot; (disconnected mode). Variation
4: PAT is willing to engage in &quot;free-for-all&quot; editing, but wishes
to make it known to other potential editors that PATis entering/leaving
the melee.</P>

<H3>4.9. Scenarios for Transactions to DELETE and UNDELETE Documents from
a Repository</H3>

<P>PAT directs that page P and all subordinate objects be deleted from
web W. Pn is subordinate to Pk is subordinate to P, and both Pk and Pn
are in scope (i.e., in W). It so happens that Pn forward links to Pk. The
delete process DEL recursively chains down from P, eventually encountering
Pk, and asserts a &quot;read lock&quot; on Pk preparatory to deleting Pk.
Since Pk has subordinate links, DEL continues down the chain until it encounters
Pn, where it asserts a &quot;read lock&quot; and recursively chains forward
to Pk. DEL requests a &quot;read lock&quot; on Pk.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>Document deletions (like container deletions) can be subject to qualifying
conditions such as meeting query and scope criteria.</LI>

<LI>Developers must be wary of deadlocks.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>4.10. Scenarios for Transactions to GET Document Attributes and Values</H3>

<P>PAT submits a list of document URIs with the request that the &quot;subject/summary&quot;
attribute value be returned for each document.</P>

<H3>4.11. Scenarios for Transactions to PUT the Value of a Document Attribute</H3>

<P>PAT requests that the value of attribute &quot;subject/summary&quot;
for document D be modified to correct an error.</P>

<H2><A NAME="toc-vers"></A>5. Scenarios Involving Versioning</H2>

<P>This section contains scenarios involving document versioning. Please
note that the three scenarios here actually form one long scenario.</P>

<P>[<I>some of the versioning functionality could also be incorporated
into the scenarios in the previous sections; OL</I>]</P>

<H3>5.1. Two people trying to change the same document</H3>

<P>A certain Web site is maintained by two people, both of whom make changes
on an ad hoc basis. As is frequently the case, there are a few documents
that are hot points of congestion, even between these two people. Both
people (we'll call them &quot;Jane&quot; and &quot;Joe&quot;) have a fancy,
version-aware Web authoring tool that interacts with their Web server.</P>

<P>Joe downloads a document from the Web site, and decides that it needs
work. He clicks on the &quot;edit&quot; button from his browser/authoring
tool, and the tool reports two things: first, that the Web server has acknowledged
his edit operation (giving him assurance that a subsequent PUT will not
be a complete surprise to the server); second, that the document he will
edit is identical to that which he viewed. This may not always be the case:
sometimes the document viewed by users is not the true, editable source
of the document. But in this case it is. Joe proceeds to revamp the document.</P>

<P>Jane meanwhile is viewing the same document and realizes that in the
document the word &quot;fuchsia&quot; has a typo. Jane also clicks the
&quot;edit&quot; button, but the authoring tool has a lengthier report
for her: in addition to what Joe was told, Jane is told that Joe is also
working on the same document. Jane calls Joe and they reach an agreement:
Jane will make her fix now (because the error is embarrassing) and Joe
will make sure this alteration makes it into his revision.</P>

<P>Jane makes her changes and clicks the &quot;save&quot; button. Her authoring
tool prompts her for a brief description of her changes, and then the server
informs Jane that her change has resulted in a new, named revision of the
document, and that name is displayed.</P>

<P>Joe forgets what he was doing, and weeks later (while working on something
else) clicks the &quot;what am I working on&quot; button. In the long list
of documents that Joe has started to change is the document we've been
discussing, and Joe decides it is time to finish it off. He makes his final
edits, and clicks the &quot;save&quot; button. Joe, however, gets a message
indicating that what he edited is no longer the latest version of the document,
and Joe clicks the &quot;merge&quot; button. The authoring tool has the
latest and greatest merge mechanisms, and in the process of resolving Jane's
work with his he realizes that Jane did more than just fix the misspelling
she said she would. That doesn't matter, because the merge mechanism uses
actual differences, not verbally stated intentions.</P>

<P>Joe again clicks the &quot;save&quot; button, and this time he is prompted
for a description and his new version of the document is saved.</P>

<H3>5.2. Revising a set of documents and publishing them when complete</H3>

<P>Jane and Joe's version-aware web server is fairly simple: normally,
it serves up the latest revision of each document, but if instructed it
will instead serve up the revisions of documents as listed in a named configuration.
In this way, they can make their trivial changes and have them show up
immediately, but if they plan to make a heavy-duty overhaul they can save
the current set as a working configuration and tell the server to use those
until the work is complete (this can all be carried out without the explicit
knowledge of Jane and Joe's authoring tool, because the Web server makes
itself configurable via Web pages with forms on them).</P>

<P>Joe is about to make a set of minor changes, and to be on the safe side
tells the server to save the current configuration as &quot;stable&quot;,
a name he uses for these occasions. He goes through the various documents,
clicking &quot;edit&quot; on any that he thinks are in need of updating.</P>

<P>Once again Joe forgets what he is doing, but a few days later the &quot;what
am I working on&quot; button again comes in handy. He realizes that his
work is about complete, and makes his final edits.</P>

<P>Joe's changes really are a coherent set that should appear simultaneously,
and he doesn't want to find out halfway through saving that Jane has made
changes that need merging, so he clicks the &quot;Save All&quot; button.
Fortunately, Jane has been busy viewing <I>other</I> parts of the web and
hasn't made any changes to their local Web pages, and so Joe is prompted
for a description of the changes he has made. Since Joe is saving all the
documents at once, a single description applies to all the changes. One
by one the new documents are saved, and in the end Joe gets confirmation
that all documents are in place. Joe browses the result and is satisfied
that their customers are seeing what he has just finished.</P>

<P>Joe goes on vacation.</P>

<H3>5.3. Reverting the revised document set</H3>

<P>Jane gets back to real work and realizes that every document that Joe
edited has the same old spelling problem. In a panic she calls Joe but
realizes that he is on vacation. Knowing that the errors would harm their
image, she decides to undo what Joe has done until he returns and can correct
his mistakes.</P>

<P>Jane begins by browsing the revision history of each document, and notes
that all the erroneous documents came about at the same time when Joe saved
his changes just before vacation.</P>

<P>Jane browses the configuration lists in the version-aware web server
and sees that Joe had made a &quot;stable&quot; configuration before his
latest work. Jane instructs the server to serve up only documents from
the &quot;stable&quot; configuration. As this doesn't involve changing
any of Joe's work, it is a quick fix to the pages on their public web server.
Jane now browses the documents on their server and is satisfied that they
are the precursors to Joe's latest change.</P>

<P>When Joe returns, he fixes his spelling mistakes and then tells the
server to resume using the latest documents.</P>

<H2><A NAME="toc-misc"></A>6. Miscellanous Scenarios</H2>

<P>This section contains scenarios relevant to distributed authoring which
do not fit in any of the preceding sections.</P>

<H3>6.1. Printing a Multi-Resource Document</H3>

<P><B>Browsing.</B> A net surfer browsing the web loads the introductory
page for a book which has been written in HTML and subdivided so that there
is a separate resource for each chapter, and many side links to clarifying
text and standalone figures. Since the book is of interest, the net surfer
would like to print the entire document. Clicking on the &quot;Print&quot;
button of their web browser brings up the Print dialog box, which contains
an option, &quot;Print multi-resource document,&quot; which they select,
before pressing the &quot;Start Printing&quot; button.</P>

<P>The browser now begins, in the background, to load all of the chapters
of the book along with their explanatory sidebars, sending them one by
one, in order, to the printer. When complete, the browser pops-up a dialog
box stating that the document has been completely printed.</P>

<P><B>Distributed Authoring.</B> This scenario applies equally well to
a distributed authoring situation. If the author of a multi-resource document
is using a distributed authoring tool to write the document, it is desirable
for them to be able to print the document as a whole, rather than by loading
and printing each resource in turn.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>This type of printing capability is supported by the KMS hypertext
system, an early monolithic (but very feature-rich) hypertext environment.</LI>

<LI>Another common example of a multi-resource document which would be
desirable to print as a whole is a slide presentation which has been converted
into HTML.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>6.2. Quick Browsing of Related Resources</H3>

<P>A professor is working on a new textbook using their favorite intranet-enabled
word processor, DistProc. Once the initial draft of this book is complete,
they use the &quot;Publish&quot; feature of DistProc to save their book
as multiple resources, one per chapter, on a web server. Since the author
intends for their students to read the text using web browsers employing
a DistProc reader plug-in, the professor has the book on the HTTP server
in DistProc native format, preserving layout information.</P>

<P>In order to provide additional browsing structure to the students, the
professor uses the feature of DistProc to automatically create links to
the table of contents, index, and glossary for the book. To make generating
feedback easier, all book chapters automatically have a link to a corrections
and feedback page. As the students are reading the text, these automatic
links are displayed as special toolbar icons in their browser.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>The AOLpress distributed authoring tool currently &quot;allows pages
to add toolbar buttons on the fly using the HTML 3.2 &quot;<TT>&lt;link
rel ...&gt;</TT>&quot; tag. For example, your page can add toolbar buttons
that link to a home page, table of contents, index, glossary, copyright
page, next page, previous page, help page, higher level page, or a bookmark
in the document.&quot;</LI>

<LI>The scenario above is currently unachievable because LINK tags are
only supported in HTML.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>6.3. Others</H3>

<P>[<I>These scenarios are interesting, but I'm not sure where they belong;
OL</I>]</P>

<P>Jane's department keeps its documents organized in hierarchical collections.
There is a collection called &quot;Monthly Reports&quot; with subcollections
for each month. There is also a collection called &quot;Monthly Business
Letters&quot; with subcollections for each month. The monthly reports are
used to derive the monthly business letters, so the monthly reports appear
in the appropriate &quot;Monthly Business Letters&quot; subcollections
as well. When Jane writes her monthly report, she puts it into Monthly
Reports/199608 and into Monthly Business Letters/199608. Only one copy
of the report should exist on the server, but it appears in both places
when users browse or search the collections.</P>

<P>The first time Jane's monthly report gets printed, it gets converted
to PostScript, which she wants to store on the server. Now there will be
two renditions of the same (version of the same) document from which she
can choose when she retrieves the document in the future. She also saves
the printing instructions (duplex, landscape, stapled, etc.) for the document,
which she may want to retrieve with the PostScript later.</P>
