  Life in a TP...
</H1>
<P>
In the finest tradition of software project management, the Payroll team
is focusing on processing the Employee database records against the latest
tax regulations and the Accounting team reads in those reports to issue payments
to banks' direct-deposit networks. Interconnecting the two is a separate
integration step: but how?
<P>
They could just communicate by processing batch files, like the previous
release -- that ran on a single mainframe. Today, they could use a distributed
file system, email the check records, pull them off of a Web server, or write
yet another custom message transfer protocol. In each case, there are different
tradeoffs between latency, reliability, security, and a hundred other details.
That is why a thousand Internet-scale messaging systems have bloomed: Telnet
for duplex bytestreams, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for pulling files, Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for reliable email messages, Network News Transfer
Protocol (NNTP) for pushing email, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for
pulling Web pages, and a host of other tolls in the same vein, from Finger
to Network File System (NFS).
<P>
<I>Seventh Heaven</I> is column about those choices. Application-layer protocols,
the seventh layer of the OSI stack, proliferate in myriad forms every time
a developer wires together software components across the Internet. The
Applications Area at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is growing
rapidly under the strain of divergent efforts, in stark contrast to the relative
stability of TCP/IP. Bookstore shelves groan under the load of books cataloging
each different species of transfer protocols (TPs) separately; this column
will develop a common framework to navigate among them.
<P>
Each month, we will focus on setting one of these TPs in context. They have
evolved to adapt to the vagaries of network topology, performance, economics,
and standards-body politics. Understanding their history is key to charting
their future as new contenders like HTTP-NG (Next Generation) take form.
Our maiden voyage, though, sets forth our ontology in general -- our vocabulary
for describing and classifying TPs.
<H4>
  What's in a TP?
</H4>
<P>
Just as lower levels of the network stack discuss transport protocols like
TCP and TP4, application-layer designers work with message transfer protocols.
There are three major components of any such TP: <I>addresses</I> to identify
participating nodes; <I>distribution</I> rules controlling transfers; and
the <I>messages</I> themselves. Admittedly, this framework is not explicitly
in the design rationale of any TPs to date -- the RFCs emphasize <I>how</I>
they work almost to the exclusion of <I>why</I> -- but I hope it proves a
useful synthesis on our tour.

<P>
Several ilities of TPs, such as reliability, latency, and maintainability
can be explained as consequences of variation along these three axes. Email,
for example, has reliable handoffs at each step, but does not establish a
direct mailbox-to-mailbox connection, so actual delivery can take a while,
usually without delivery notification. Furthermore, each handoff is traceable
through <TT>Received:</TT> headers for debugging. HTTP, in contrast, is a
synchronous request-reply protocol which requires direct, online connections.
Transport-layer security can be directly composed with HTTP to encrypt the
end-to-end connection; email's hop-by-hop transfers cannot.
<H4>
  Names &amp; Addresses
</H4>
<P>
The first things a TP must define are its <I>addresses</I> for the nodes
it transfer messages between, and the <I>names</I> for the entities it transfers.
For many TPs, the endpoints are network interfaces on the connected Internet,
so they use domain names or IP addresses directly. Sometimes, the endpoints
are logical concepts, like individual users' mailboxes or globally-distributed
newsgroups. &nbsp;The entities they purport to transfer have to be represented
as messages, so their names identify the message at hand. Names are more
intimately tied to the semantics of the service: Telnet provides a Network
Virtual Terminal (NVT) to some port on a host; FTP and HTTP servers can be
queried for the value of particular pathnames; and SMTP and NNTP refer to
messages by their globally-unique RFC-822 <TT>msgid</TT>s.
<P>
Sometimes there are additional relations between these two. An &nbsp;HTTP
caching proxy uses names that include the original host address (e.g.
<TT>http://cache/http://.../...</TT>). Similarly, an FTP mirror site maintains
a copy of the same file at a different host, possibly with a derived name
(e.g. a prefix like <TT>/mirrors/sumex-aim/...</TT>). However, after fetching
a file, its name is the local filesystem pathname; FTP does not use metadata
to bind it to its "original" name.
<H4>
  Push &amp; Pull
</H4>
<P>
Traditionally, various TPs' distribution rules are seen as their most salient
classification. There are two levels of such description, though. At the
mechanical level, they are all built atop TCP, so it is natural for clients
to initiate the process. However, we can speak of a more abstract intent
in deployed applications: for senders to push data at their will, or for
receivers to pull data at theirs. traditional Web clients can only fetch
data from servers; but FTP service usually allows up- and down-loading, so
the net effect can be push <I>or</I> pull (although FTP service built-in
to those Web browsers cannot upload!).
<P>
Another significant point about the distribution rules are their topologies.
Again, while TCP/IP is a point-to-point service, the net effect of message
delivery can vary. Telnet is a strictly one-on-one service; but email, with
its intermediate relays and multiply-'name'd envelopes, can provide broadcast
messaging. Similarly, though HTTP connections are one-on-one, the net effect
of publishing a URL is also to broadcast the data. Multicasting experiments,
such as Newscaster and Self-Organizing Multicast Transfer Protocol [1] are
changing these rules.
<P>
Finally, the choice of synchronicity determines whether and how TP services
can be proxied by other parties. As opposed to simple tunneling, proxy service
implies reprocessing of a message by an intermediate node. Synchronous
conversations like HTTP can only be chained, while asynchronous handoffs
can form an asymmetric loop, as in email routing. Synchronous one-to-many
broadcasting can also cause 'ACK implosions', which explains why real-time
broadcasting is designed to accommodate loss rather than process acknowledgments.
<H4>
  Meatdata &amp; Metadata
</H4>
<P>
Messages are where the rubber meets the road in TP design. First, most TPs
are designed with a particular type of content in mind, and optimized to
that end. Second, the elemental Protocol Data Units (PDUs) in these systems
are messages that combine an envelope, the command and metadata about the
entity, and a concrete representation of the entity itself.
<P>
Message content affects the choice of transport in TPs: login emulation with
Telnet requires the URGent delivery flag in TCP segments; delivery of open-ended
streaming data motivates a separate TCP connection for each HTTP/1.x operation;
and time-critical multimedia content may use UDP datagrams directly.
<P>
The bytes on the wire of a message usually combine the commands of the
distribution algorithm and the contents (FTP, though, separates its control
and data channels). Messages combine the 'meatdata', some snapshot of the
resource itself, and metadata. Typically, the source and destination addresses
and transaction logs describe the command; content-type, content-name, and
content-lifetime information (for caching) describe the entity. Traditional
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and distributed-object protocols also exchange
lightweight messages, but such caching and reflection support has been unknown
to date. Furthermore, advanced TPs also leverage interactions between such
metadata and the distribution commands, as with HTTP's content-negotiation
and cache-validation GETs.

<P>
Application layer developers, like our friends from Personnel, have a new
pivot point for deciding how to transfer messages between their software
modules. What classically was a single-necked hourglass of Internet development
-- common interoperability of IP packets -- is becoming a double-necked hourglass
with application-layer consensus around URIs for naming and addressing and
MIME-like messages for envelopes and data[2].<P>

Of course, where Sir Issac&nbsp;Newton claimed "If I have seen further, it
is by standing upon the shoulders of Giants," Digital researcher Brian Ried
quipped, "In Computer Science, we stand on each other's feet" -- what have
we learned from the evolution of TPs over the last fifteen years? Consider
FoRK, the mailing list of an electronic community of <I>Friends of Rohit
Khare</I>: each message is available as email, in a local newsgroup, as an
archived web page (both at my own site and at Findmail.com, with different
URL paths), and as FTP'able mailbox files. Why should the same resource --
words in an ongoing conversation -- have to adopt a half-dozen different
names and addresses to reach different people? Why isn't there a stable
identifier and storage format which might bridge them all, to become more
future-proof? To say nothing of integrating references to a realtime video
chat room...
