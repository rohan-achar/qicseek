<h1>Simultaneous Source Location problem on Trees</h1>

<h2>Presented by Josiah Carlson</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
<p>
This short talk will cover some preliminaries to the Simultaneous Source
Location problem on Trees, as well as a few variant solutions that
brings us to the currently known best solution to the problem.  The new
algorithm significantly improves both space and time bounds in the
general case to be within a log factor of the balanced case.
