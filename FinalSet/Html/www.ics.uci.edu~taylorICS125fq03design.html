This deliverable will consist of two primary components:a design specification (consisting of a high-level architectural designand module specifications) and an integration test plan. <P>You may wish to do an object-oriented design and adhere to the ObjectModeling Technique. In this case, your design specification shouldinclude the following three models: the object model, which consists ofobject diagrams; the dynamic model, which consists of event traces andstate diagrams; and the functional model, which consists of data flow diagrams.The design should describe all system level objects/tasks, operations,the relationships between those objects/tasks, and external interactionwith the environment as well as object class specifications that furtherdetail the object design.<P>In conjunction with this object-oriented design, your team must developan integration test plan covering theinterfaces between specified modules and/or objects. The integrationtest plan must cover all interactions between modules/objects by applyingfunctional test heuristics (black box) to each module/class interface inthe design specification and developing a test plan for each interactionbetween modules and/or objects.<P>Your document must specify the correspondence between therequirements specification and your design. You may show thiscorrespondence any way you feel is appropriate (e.g., make notationsthroughout your document or using a table that cross-referencesparagraph numbers).<P>Developing the software design will undoubtedly reveal inadequaciesin previous documents. Please note these problems and what was done tosolve them.<P>Don't forget to include your meeting minutes and performance appraisalswith your document; refer to the syllabus for the complete check-list ofwhat has to be turned in. As before, make sure that you post your designdocument and your meeting minutes to your team web page.<HR><H3> Deliverable Objectives/Quality</H3>Keep in mind that key objectives of a design document are to:<UL><LI> Develop a coherent representation of software that will satisfy requirements</LI><LI> Identify inadequacies in requirements</LI><LI> Decompose the system into sub-systems that provide related sets of services</LI><LI> Establish a framework for sub-system control and communication</LI><LI> Specify modules that can be assigned as coding responsibilities</LI><LI> Document design decisions and rationale</LI><LI> Provide a reference tool readable by developers, testers, and maintainers</LI><LI> Provide a basis for integration and testing</LI></UL>In addition, keep in mind that a design document should exhibit thefollowing qualities:<UL><LI> Complete: everything that is essential is described</LI><LI> Rigorous: expressed in a well-defined notation</LI><LI> Consistent: no mismatched interfaces</LI><LI> Uniform: the entire document is at same level of detail</LI><LI> Modifiable: this document will change just like all the others</LI><LI> Desensitized to change: hides implementation details and secrets</LI><LI> Confirmable, verifiable and testable: you can tell when you've met thedesign</LI></UL><HR><H3> Document Contents</H3><H4> Introduction</H4>Expand your introduction to discuss your specific approaches to thedesign of the system and the organization of this document. Thisdescription is essentially just an updated version of the introductionyou included in your previous deliverable.<H4> Understanding</H4>Expand the understanding section of your previous document. Make sureto add descriptions of what steps or actions you took to understandeach technology studied during this phase. If you make changes to thissection, add text describing why the change was necessary, and why itmore accurately reflects your new understanding. This section need notbe different if your understanding hasn't changed.<H4> Project Plan</H4>This will be an iterative expansion of your previous submission. Expandyour project plan to represent how you have accomplished the work sofar.  Reassess the project risks. Expand your task network or workbreakdown structure to include the effort expended to complete thistask. Based on the work you have done, revise your estimates on howmuch your team can accomplish and deliver.<P>If you make changes, add text describing why the change wasnecessary or why it will improve the ability of your team to accomplishthe work you have proposed.<H4> Design Specification</H4><UL><LI> Architecture Overview</LI>   <UL>   <LI> Architectural Style</LI>   <BR>What style of architecture did you adopt? Provide a reference to a   defining document.      <LI> System Architecture Overview</LI>   <BR>This is the place for your "one great diagram" that shows how your   system is built.

Testcases should cover each module/object and module/object interactionspecified in the design. You should consider each module/object as asubsystem and apply functional (black box) test heuristics (such asinput/output coverage and error/exception coverage) to the parametersidentified in each operation in the interface. In addition, you shoulddevelop a test case for each module/object interaction.<P>NOTE: if desired, the test cases can be grouped with the designentity to which they apply, otherwise a cross reference listing of somesort should be provided.<UL>   <LI> For each test</LI>      <UL>      <LI> Test ID</LI>      <LI> Purpose of Test</LI>      <LI> Item(s) being tested</LI>      <LI> Input specification</LI>      <LI> Output specification</LI>         <UL>         <LI> Expected Results or Test Oracle Mechanism</LI>         </UL>      <LI> Test environmental needs or special test procedures</LI>      </UL></UL><H4> Initial Demonstration Plan</H4>What and how will you demonstrate? <H4> Tracking and Control Mechanisms</H4><p>Configuration Management: how will your modules/objects be managed?<UL>   <LI> file structure, sub-directories, Makefiles, etc.</LI>   <LI> persistent data</LI></UL><p>Requirements Cross Reference: what modules/objects satisfy what requirements?<UL>   <LI> a table mapping requirement to module/object</LI>   <BR>make sure it is complete and consistent.</UL><H4> Modifications to Prior Documents</H4><H5> Requirements</H5>If any requirements changed, were added or deleted, this is the placeto make this explicit. Highlight why the requirement waschanged/added/deleted and by whom (customer, developer, etc.). Makesure your requirements meet the objectives of completeness,understandability, utility, unambiguity, and consistency. If yourrequirements have not changed, then this section should be identical towhat you submitted earlier.<H4> Glossary</H4>Defines any terms used in the specifications above.  This portion ofthe document may be written as an extension to the glossary submittedwith the requirements, or may be a separate document that only definesterms local to the design phase.<H4> Additional Documentation</H4>This section is reserved for any additional documentation developedduring this phase of the project. Specifically, if during the course ofdeveloping the architecture your understanding of the varioustechnologies involved in the project changed, or you discovered itemsthat were not documented but which are important, include thatinformation here.<P>Also list here the major background sources that you used duringthis phase or any that you plan to use during the remainder of theproject. This includes references to similar systems and/orprocedures.<hr><h3>Design Presentations/Reviews.</h3>See the syllabus for dates.<P>Each team should prepare a 15 minute presentation, after which we willallow up to 5 minutes of questions. <p>Prepare your presentation appropriately. Your presentation should includethe following:<UL>   <LI> Some context for your project (brief!);</LI>   <LI> Current state of your project plan;</LI>   <LI> Highlights of your design including</LI>      <UL>      <LI> an overview of your architecture (this should comprise the bulk	 of your presentation)</LI>      <LI> one or more key module/object specifications;</LI>      </UL>   <LI> Modifications to your requirements that arose as a result of your design   process;</LI>   <LI> Overview of your integration test plan.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
