I'm
<a href=misc/scotland.html>Scottish</a> (hence the accent).
I grew up in
<a
href=http://dest.travelocity.com/DestGuides/geo_main/0,1743,TRAVELOCITY|2524,00.html>
Glasgow</a>,
and then committed an act of cultural
heresy by moving to Glasgow's evil arch-nemesis,
<a href=http://www.edinburgholdtown.ork.uk>Edinburgh</a>.
On the other hand, that wasn't as bad as when I later moved to
England...
</p>

<p>
I studied
<a href=http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk>Computer Science</a>
and
<a href=http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk>Artificial
Intelligence</a>
at
the
<a href=http:/www.ed.ac.uk>University of Edinburgh</a>.
I also worked there to pay my way
through school; I worked first
in the
<a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk>
Centre for Speech Technology Research</a>)
(part of the Department of Artificial Intelligence),
and later at the
<a href=http://www.ucs.ed.ac.uk>University Computing
Service</a>,
writing
an implementation of
<a href=http://www.cs.yale.edu/Linda/linda.html>
Linda</a> (cool) in
<a
href=http://wotug.ukc.ac.uk/parallel/www/occam/occam.html>
occam</a> (yuk)
on a huge parallel transputer machine that eventually became
the basis of the
<a href=http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>
Edinburgh Parallel Computing Center</a>.
</p>

<p>
After graduating, I moved to
Cambridge
(the original one) to join what was then called
Rank Xerox EuroPARC, and is now the
Cambridge Lab of the
<a href=http://www.xrce.xerox.com>Xerox Research Center
Europe</a>.
I worked on a variety of projects around the general topic of computer
support for workgroup collaboration, including the "RAVE" media space,
the
<a href=publications/portholes.html>Portholes</a>
distributed awareness system, the
<a href=publications/freeflow.html>Freeflow</a> workflow
architecture and the
<a href=publications/prosp.html>Prospero</a> toolkit for collaborative
applications. This last was also the topic of my
<a href=thesis>PhD</a>, which I took
concurrently during my last few years there.
</p>

<p>
I came to the US in 1996 to work
in the
<a
href=http://www.acm.org/sigchi/bulletin/1998.2/harris.html>
Discourse Architecture Lab</a>
at <a href=http://www.apple.com>Apple Computer</a>.
When I arrived, the immigration official made some
snide remarks about the fact that I wouldn't need a three-year visa,
and he was right; Apple disbanded its research lab 10 months later.
I moved
<a
href=http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?ed=bnJX2.V.wilteLf5JMcz8dfBqz.zTOrkwXNVspO2ed8qgImdYwr0qP.F252m__YDNJZj2Uw16g--&csz=Cupertino%2C+CA+95014-2083&country=us&tcsz=palo+alto%2C+ca&tcountry=us>
up the road</a>
to
<a href=http://www.parc.xerox.com>Xerox PARC</a>, to join
the
Computer Science Lab,
home to the bean-bag chairs and various other
holdouts from the seventies.
The main project I worked on was a large interactive document system
called
<a href=http://www.parc.xerox.com/placeless>
Placeless Documents</a>,
although some <a href=barney>side projects</a>
kept us amused.
</p>

<p>
We just bought a house. It's lovely, but needs some work. It's
going to be
<a href=house>quite a project</a>...
