How to Meet Asynchronously (Almost) Everywhere

<p>
Two independent agents (robots) start in arbitrary nodes of an unknown
connected graph (finite or infinite). Agents select their own routes
(graph edges they want to take), but their movement along an edge is
governed by an adversary.  The authors give a deterministic algorithm
that guarantees the agents will eventually meet at some point of the
graph (not necessarily a vertex).  The result is extended to a geometric
scenario (on a plane).
