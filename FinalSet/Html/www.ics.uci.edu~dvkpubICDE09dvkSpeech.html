Digital cameras and multimedia capture devices are becoming
increasingly popular to take pictures.Annotating these pictures
is important to support their browsing and retrieval. Fully
automatic image annotation techniques typically rely entirely on
visual properties of the image. The state of the art image
annotation systems of this kind work well in detecting generic
object classes: car, horse, motorcycle, airplane, etc. However,
certain characteristics of the image are hard to capture using
strictly the visual properties. These include location (Paris,
California, San Francisco, etc), event (birthday, wedding,
graduation ceremony, etc), people (John, Jane, brother, etc) and
abstract qualities referring to objects in the image (beautiful,
funny, sweet, etc) among others. The more conventional method of
annotation that relies completely on human input has several
limitations as well. Typing tags using the keypads of such devices
can be cumbersome and error-prone. Secondly, delay in tagging may
result in a loss of context in which the picture was taken (e.g.,
user may not remember the names of the people/structures in the
image).

This presents an opportunity for using speech as a modality to
annotate images and/or other multimedia content. Most camera
devices have a built-in microphone. In principle, some of the
challenges associated with both, fully automatic annotation as
well as manual tagging can be alleviated if the user were to use
speech as a medium of annotation. Ideally, the user would take a
picture and speak the desired tags into the device's microphone. A
speech recognizer would transcribe the audio signal into text. The
speech to text transcription can happen either on the device
itself or be done on a remote machine. The transcribed text can be
used as tags for the image, exactly as the user intended. One of
the biggest bottlenecks facing such systems is the accuracy of the
underlying speech recognizer. Even speaker dependent recognition
systems can make mistakes in noisy environments. If the
recognizer's output is considered as is for annotation, then poor
recognition will lead to poor quality tags. Our work tries to
address this issue by incorporating outside semantic knowledge to
improve interpretation of the recognizer's output, as opposed to
blindly believing what the recognizer suggests. To improve
interpretation of speech output, we exploit the fact that most
speech recognizers provide alternate hypotheses for each
utterance.
 The main contribution of this paper is our approach for annotating
images using speech as the input modality. The approach employs a
 probabilistic
 model for computing the joint probability of a given combination of tags
 using a Maximum Entropy solution. The extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates
 the advantage of the proposed solution, that leads to a significant improvement
 of quality of speech annotation.
