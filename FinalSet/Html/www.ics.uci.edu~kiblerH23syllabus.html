<H2>Course Goals</H2>
<P>Using the Java language students will learn the properties and implementation details of the fundamental data
structures (arrays, lists, queues, stacks, dictionaries, hashtables, trees, graphs) that often are at the heart
of any program. Students will also learn basic problem solving methods, such as divide and conquer, separate and
conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, tree and search algorithms as well as some useful applications.
As part of the coding assigments, students will be expected to analyse their code and follow good object-oriented
design. 
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<H2>Grading</H2>
<P>There will be approximately 8 programming assignments two quizzes and a final. The coding assignments will be
in Java. Your lowest homework score will be dropped. Roughly, the exams and homeworks will count equally. The final
exam will be based on the text, lecture notes, and homeworks. Each chapter ends with a summary. Be sure that you
know every concept discussed in the summary. The fastest way to get questions answered is to email either the TA
or me. Answers of general interest will be posted on the bulletin board (ics.H23). You may also use the bulletin
board to ask classmates for appropriate help. Any form of inappropriate help will result in an F grade in the class
and a letter in your file.
