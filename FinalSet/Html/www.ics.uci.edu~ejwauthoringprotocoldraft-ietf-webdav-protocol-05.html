<H2>Abstract</H2>


<P>This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types
   ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties,
   creation and management of resource collections, namespace
   manipulation, resource locking (collision avoidance), and efficient
   transmission of resource changes.

<h2>Changes</h2>

<h3>1.1. Changes since draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-04.txt</h3>

   [Editor's note: This section will not appear in the final form of
   this document.  Its purpose is to provide a concise list of changes
   from the previous revision of the draft for use by reviewers.]

<P>Added this change section.

<P>Removed scoping for namespaces so the namespace for
   every element is explicitly stated.

<P>Changed the syntax from &lt;?XML:Namespace.../&gt; to &lt;?namespace...?&gt;.

<P>Removed propfindresult, this was left over from the old search
   format.

<P>Changed all the DAV XML element names to lower case.

<P>Changed the property format to use Name and Namespace rather than
   name and schema.

<P>Removed proploc attribute and removed section on GETting, DELETEing,
   and PUTing properties since we do not provide a mechanism for
   getting a URI for properties.  Also removed the requirement that
   properties be URI addressable.

<P>Removed quoted string choice from owner header, it is just XML.

<P>Made all the HTTP error codes use the same format.

<P>Changed the name of the create element in <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> to set, the new
   name seems to cause less confusion.

<P>Moved all headers in the draft to a single section.

<P>Deleted the state token section of the draft and moved the state
   token headers to the header section of the draft.  Removed the state
   token header.

<P>Changed the write lock section to state that a Lock-Token request
   header, not a state-token request header, is to be submitted on
   request for write locked resources.

<P>Created a "generic" XML element section for XML elements that get
   repeatedly re-used throughout the spec.  I moved LINK XML element to
   this section.

<P>Made <TT> multistatus</TT> and Schema discovery their own level one sections.

<P>Collected all the properties together.

<P>Removed all references to the possibility of properties have their
   own URIs.  This includes removing the property identifier section.

<P>Separated the section on web collections and namespaces into two
   separate sections.

<P>Collected all the new response codes together into their own
   section.

<P>Changed the XML multiresponse element name to <TT> multistatus</TT>.

<P>Added a stand alone section on levels of DAV compliance. I also went
   method by method, property by property, to specify compliance
   requirements.

<P>Added an introduction.

<P>Changed all the "True" and "False" to "T" and "F".

<P>Altered the first two paragraphs of the Property Names section to
   make the relationship between a property's name and its schema a
   little clearer.  I also added some text in the same section defining
   a property name as a namespace and element.

<P>Added a second paragraph to property model for http resources -
   overview.  This paragraph clarifies why XML was chosen.

<P>Added a 409 Conflict error to move to cover attempts to move a
   collection with members.

<P>Changed the collection requirement to read the collections SHOULD
   end with "/".  Also added a SHOULD about returning a location header
   if the client submits a URL for a collection without a trailing "/".

<P>Moved the owner header into the body due to size concerns.

<P>Replaced the iscollection xml element with <TT>resourcetype</TT>.

<P>Moved the DAV property to the <TT>DAV</TT> header that is returned with
   <TT>OPTIONS</TT>.

<P>Folded the tree draft into this draft.  Changed the <TT>DELETE</TT>, <TT>COPY</TT>,
   and <TT>MOVE</TT> sections to include their effect on collections as taken
   from the tree draft.  Created a <TT>Depth</TT> header section and put in the
   general rules that were in the introduction to the tree draft.  I
   also added the 102 response and response-status header.

<P>Removed the versioning section.

<P>Put all the methods into a single section.

<P>Replaced the <TT>PROPFIND</TT> request body with a propfind header. Now the
   response can be cached just using vary.

<P>Nuked resinfo for <TT>INDEX</TT> and combined it with <TT> multistatus</TT> which is
   now used for both <TT>INDEX</TT> and <TT>PROPFIND</TT>.  Stripped down <TT>INDEX</TT> as
   agreed.

<P>Removed the problem definition and proposed solution sections. We
   can always cut and paste them together from the older version if we
   feel we need them but this draft is supposed to be a dry run for
   last call and last call documents do not have problem
   definition/proposed solution sections.

<P>Killed the section on schema discovery, it is controversial and we
   aren't going to be able to require it.  We should specify it in a
   different spec.

<P>Added a section on notational conventions used within the document.

<P>Moved the terminology section to the end of the document to provide
   better flow from the high-level introduction to the specific
   introduction sections.

<P>Increased the numeric value of the 4xx status codes introduced in
   this specification to avoid conflicts with the new revision of the
   HTTP/1.1 specification, which introduces two new 4xx status codes.

<P>Wrote internationalization concerns section.

<P>Added XML version number to all examples.

<h2>2. Introduction</h2>

<P>This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 protocol that
   allows clients to perform remote web content authoring operations.
   This extension provides a coherent set of methods, headers, request
   entity body formats, and response entity body formats that provide
   operations for:

<P>Properties: The ability to create, remove, and query information
   about Web pages, such as its author, creation date, etc. Also, the
   ability to link pages of any media type to related pages.

<P>Collections: The ability to create sets of related documents, and to
   receive a listing of pages at a particular hierarchy level (like a
   directory listing in a file system).

<P>Locking: The ability to keep more than one person from working on a
   document at the same time. This prevents the "lost update problem"
   in which modifications are lost as first one author, then another
   writes their changes without merging the other author's changes

<P>Namespace Operations: The ability to copy and move Web resources

<P>Efficient Update: The ability to send changes which are proportional
   to the size of the change rather than retransmitting the entire
   resource.

<P>Requirements and rationale for these operations are described in a
   companion document, "Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and
   Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web" [Slein et al., 1997].

<P>The sections below provide a detailed introduction to resource
   properties (Section 3), collections of resources (Section 4), and
   locking operations (Section 5).  These sections introduce the
   abstractions manipulated by the WebDAV-specific HTTP methods
   described in Section 8, "HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring".

<P>In HTTP/1.1, method parameter information was exclusively encoded in
   HTTP headers. Unlike HTTP/1.1, WebDAV, encodes method parameter
   information either in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) [Bray,
   Sperberg-McQueen, 1997] request entity body, or in an HTTP header.
   The use of XML to encode method parameters was motivated by the
   ability to add extra XML elements to existing structures, providing
   extensibility, and by XML's ability to encode information in ISO
   10646 character sets, providing internationalization support. As a
   rule of thumb, parameters are encoded in XML entity bodies when they
   have unbounded length, or when they may be shown to a human user and
   hence require encoding in an ISO 10646 character set.  Otherwise,
   parameters are encoded within an HTTP header.  Section 9 describes
   the new HTTP headers used with WebDAV methods.

<P>In addition to encoding method parameters, XML is used in WebDAV to
   encode the responses from methods, providing the extensibility and
   internationalization advantages of XML for method output, as well as
   input. XML elements used in this specification are defined in
   Section 12.

<P>While the response codes provided by HTTP/1.1 are sufficient to
   describe the preponderance of error conditions encountered by WebDAV
   methods, there are some errors that do not fall neatly into the
   existing categories.  New status codes developed for the WebDAV
   methods are defined in Section 10.  Since some WebDAV methods may
   operate over many resources, the multiresponse status type has been
   introduced to return status information for multiple resources.
   Multiresponse status is described in Section 11.

<P>The properties mechanism is employed by WebDAV to store information
   about the current state of the resource.  For example, when a lock
   is taken out on a resource, a lock information property describes
   the current state of the lock. Section 13 defines the properties
   used within the WebDAV specification.

<P>Finishing off the specification are sections on what it means to be
   compliant with this specification (Section 14), on
   internationalization support (Section 15), and on security (Section
   16).


<h2>3. Data Model for Resource Properties</h2>

<h3>3.1. The Resource Property Model</h3>

<P>Properties are pieces of data that describe the state of a resource.
   Properties are data about data.

<P>Properties are used in distributed authoring environments to provide
   for efficient discovery and management of resources.  For example, a
   'subject' property might allow for the indexing of all resources by
   their subject, and an 'author' property might allow for the
   discovery of what authors have written which documents.

<P>The DAV property model consists of name/value pairs.  The name of a
   property identifies the property's syntax and semantics, and
   provides an address by which to refer to that syntax and semantics.

<P>There are two categories of properties: "live" and "non-live".  A
   live property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the server.
   This represents the two cases of a) the value of a property is read-only, maintained by the server, and b) the value of the property is
   maintained by the client, but server performs syntax checking on
   submitted values. A non-live property has its syntax and semantics
   enforced by the client; the server merely records the value of the
   property verbatim.

<h3>3.2. Existing Metadata Proposals</h3>

<P>Properties have long played an essential role in the maintenance of
   large document repositories, and many current proposals contain some
   notion of a property, or discuss web metadata more generally.  These
   include PICS [Miller et al., 1996], PICS-NG, the Rel/Rev draft
   [Maloney, 1996], Web Collections, XML [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen,
   1997], several proposals on representing relationships within HTML,
   digital signature manifests (DCMF), and a position paper on Web
   metadata architecture [Berners-Lee, 1997].  Work on PICS-NG and Web
   Collections has been subsumed by the Resource Definition Framework
   (RDF) metadata activity of the World Wide Web Consortium, which
   consists of a network-based data model and an XML representation of
   that model.

<P>Some proposals come from a digital library perspective.  These
   include the Dublin Core [Weibel et al., 1995] metadata set and the
   Warwick Framework [Lagoze, 1996], a container architecture for
   different metadata schemas.  The literature includes many examples
   of metadata, including MARC [MARC, 1994], a bibliographic metadata
   format, and RFC 1807 [Lasher, Cohen, 1995], a technical report
   bibliographic format employed by the Dienst system. Additionally,
   the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata conference describe
   many community-specific metadata sets.

<P>Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK
   [Lagoze, 1996], noted that, "new metadata sets will develop as the
   networked infrastructure matures" and "different communities will
   propose, design, and be responsible for different types of
   metadata." These observations can be corroborated by noting that
   many community-specific sets of metadata already exist, and there is
   significant motivation for the development of new forms of metadata
   as many communities increasingly make their data available in
   digital form, requiring a metadata format to assist data location
   and cataloging.

<h3>3.3. Properties and HTTP Headers</h3>

<P>Properties already exist, in a limited sense, in HTTP message
   headers.  However, in distributed authoring environments a
   relatively large number of properties are needed to describe the
   state of a resource, and setting/returning them all through HTTP
   headers is inefficient.  Thus a mechanism is needed which allows a
   principal to identify a set of properties in which the principal is
   interested and to then set or retrieve just those properties.

<h3>3.4. Property Values</h3>

<P>The value of a property is expressed as a well-formed XML document.

<P>XML has been chosen because it is a flexible, self-describing,
   structured data format that supports rich schema definitions, and
   because of its support for multiple character sets.  XML's self-describing nature allows any property's value to be extended by
   adding new elements.  Older clients will not break because they will
   still have the data specified in the original schema and will ignore
   elements they do not understand.  XML's support for multiple
   character sets allows human-readable properties to be encoded and
   read in a character set familiar to the user.

<h3>3.5. Property Names</h3>

<P>A property name is a universally unique identifier that is
   associated with a schema that provides information about the syntax
   and semantics of the property.

<P>Because a property's name is universally unique, clients can depend
   upon consistent behavior for a particular property across multiple
   resources, so long as that property is "live" on the resources in
   question.

<P>The XML namespace mechanism, which is based on URIs, is used to name
   properties because it provides a mechanism to prevent namespace
   collisions and for varying degrees of administrative control.

<P>The property namespace is flat; that is, no hierarchy of properties
   is explicitly recognized.  Thus, if a property A and a property A/B
   exist on a resource, there is no recognition of any relationship
   between the two properties.  It is expected that a separate
   specification will eventually be produced which will address issues
   relating to hierarchical properties.

<P>Finally, it is not possible to define the same property twice on a
   single resource, as this would cause a collision in the resource's
   property namespace.


<h2>4. Collections of Web Resources</h2>

<P>This section provides a description of a new type of Web resource,
   the collection, and discusses its interactions with the HTTP URL
   namespace. The purpose of a collection resource is to model
   collection-like objects (e.g., filesystem directories) within a
   server's namespace.

<P>All DAV compliant resources MUST support the HTTP URL namespace
   model specified herein.

<h3>4.1. Collection Resources</h3>

<P>A collection is a resource whose state consists of an unordered list
   of internal members, an unordered list of external members, and a
   set of properties.  An internal member resource MUST have a URI that
   is immediately relative to the base URI of the collection, that is,
   a relative URI in which "../" is illegal, which MUST begin with "./"
   and which SHOULD contain a "/" at the end of the URI if the internal
   member resource is itself a collection.

<P>An external member resource MUST be an absolute URI that is not an
   internal URI.  Any given internal or external URI MUST only belong
   to the collection once, i.e., it is illegal to have multiple
   instances of the same URI in a collection.  Properties defined on
   collections behave exactly as do properties on non-collection
   resources.

<P>There is a standing convention that when a collection is referred to
   by its name without a trailing slash, the trailing slash is
   automatically appended.  Due to this, a resource MAY accept a URI
   without a trailing "/" to point to a collection. In this case it
   SHOULD return a location header in the response pointing to the URL
   ending with the "/".  For example, if a client performs an <TT>INDEX</TT> on
   http://foo.bar/blah (no trailing slash), the resource
   http://foo.bar/blah/ (trailing slash) MAY respond as if the
   operation were invoked on it, and SHOULD return a location header
   with http://foo.bar/blah/ in it.


<h3>4.2. Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources</h3>

<P>This document specifies the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method to create new collection
   resources, rather than using the existing HTTP/1.1 <TT>PUT</TT> or <TT>POST</TT>
   method, for the following reasons

<P>In HTTP/1.1, the <TT>PUT</TT> method is defined to store the request body at
   the location specified by the Request-URI.  While a description
   format for a collection can readily be constructed for use with <TT>PUT</TT>,
   the implications of sending such a description to the server are
   undesirable.  For example, if a description of a collection that
   omitted some existing resources were <TT>PUT</TT> to a server, this might be
   interpreted as a command to remove those members.  This would extend
   <TT>PUT</TT> to perform <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality, which is undesirable since it
   changes the semantics of <TT>PUT</TT>, and makes it difficult to control
   <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality with an access control scheme based on methods.

<P>While the <TT>POST</TT> method is sufficiently open-ended that a "create a
   collection" <TT>POST</TT> command could be constructed, this is undesirable
   because it would be difficult to separate access control for
   collection creation from other uses of <TT>POST</TT>.

<P>This document specifies the <TT>INDEX</TT> method for listing the contents of
   a collection, rather than relying on the existing HTTP/1.1 <TT>GET</TT>
   method.  This is to avoid conflict with the de-facto standard
   practice of redirecting a <TT>GET</TT> request on a directory to its
   index.html resource.

<P>The exact definition of the behavior of <TT>GET</TT> and <TT>PUT</TT> on collections
   is defined later in this document.

<h3>4.3. HTTP URL Namespace Model</h3>

<P>The HTTP URL Namespace is a hierarchical namespace where the
   hierarchy is delimited with the "/" character.  DAV compliant
   resources MUST maintain the consistency of the HTTP URL namespace.
   Any attempt to create a resource (excepting the root member of a
   namespace) that would not be the internal member of a collection
   MUST fail. For example, if the collection http://www.foo.bar.org/a/
   exists, but http://www.foo.bar.org/a/b/does not exist, an attempt to
   create http://www.foo.bar.org/a/b/c must fail.

<h3>4.4. Source Resources and Output Resources</h3>

<P>For many resources, the entity returned by a <TT>GET</TT> method exactly
   matches the persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF
   file stored on a disk.  For this simple case, the URL at which a
   resource is accessed is identical to the URL at which the source
   (the persistent state) of the resource is accessed.  This is also
   the case for HTML source files that are not processed by the server
   prior to transmission.

<P>However, the server can sometimes process HTML resources before they
   are transmitted as a return entity body.  For example, server-side-include directives within an HTML file instruct a server to replace
   the directive with another value, such as the current date.  In this
   case, what is returned by <TT>GET</TT> (HTML plus date) differs from the
   persistent state of the resource (HTML plus directive).  Typically
   there is no way to access the HTML resource containing the
   unprocessed directive.

<P>Sometimes the entity returned by <TT>GET</TT> is the output of a data-producing process that is described by one or more source resources
   (that may not even have a location in the URL namespace).  A single
   data-producing process may dynamically generate the state of a
   potentially large number of output resources.  An example of this is
   a CGI script that describes a "finger" gateway process that maps
   part of the namespace of a server into finger requests, such as
   http://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.

<P>In the absence of distributed authoring capabilities, it is
   acceptable to have no mapping of source resource(s) to the URI
   namespace. In fact, preventing access to the source resource(s) has
   desirable security benefits.  However, if remote editing of the
   source resource(s) is desired, the source resource(s) should be
   given a location in the URI namespace.  This source location should
   not be one of the locations at which the generated output is
   retrievable, since in general it is impossible for the server to
   differentiate requests for source resources from requests for
   process output resources.  There is often a many-to-many
   relationship between source resources and output resources.

<P>On WebDAV compliant servers, for all output resources which have a
   single source resource (and that source resource has a URI), the URI
   of the source resource SHOULD be stored in a link on the output
   resource with type http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/source.  Note
   that by storing the source URIs in links on the output resources,
   the burden of discovering the source is placed on the authoring
   client.


<h2>5. Locking</h2>

<P>The ability to lock a resource provides a mechanism for serializing
   access to that resource.  Using a lock, an authoring client can
   provide a reasonable guarantee that another principal will not
   modify a resource while it is being edited.  In this way, a client
   can prevent the "lost update" problem.

<P>This specification allows locks to vary over two client-specified
   parameters, the number of principals involved (exclusive vs. shared)
   and the type of access to be granted.  Furthermore, this document
   only provides the definition of locking for one lock access type,
   the write lock.  However, the syntax is extensible, and permits the
   eventual specification of other access types.

<h3>5.1. Exclusive Vs. Shared Locks</h3>

<P>The most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock.  This is a lock
   where the access right in question is only granted to a single
   principal.  The need for this arbitration results from a desire to
   avoid having to constantly merge results.

<P>However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to exclude
   others from exercising an access right but rather to provide a
   mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend to exercise
   their access right.  Shared locks are provided for this case.  A
   shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a lock.  Hence any
   principal with appropriate access can get the lock.

<P>With shared locks there are two trust sets that affect a resource.
   The first trust set is created by access permissions.  Principals
   who are trusted, for example, may have permission to write the
   resource.  Those who are not, don't.  Among those who have access
   permission to write the resource, the set of principals who have
   taken out a shared lock also must trust each other, creating a
   (typically) smaller trust set within the access permission write
   set.

<P>Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most
   situations the vast majority of these principals will not have write
   access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do have write
   access, some principals may decide to guarantee their edits are free
   from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write locks.  Others may
   decide they trust their collaborators will not overwrite their work
   (the potential set of collaborators being the set of principals who
   have write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their
   collaborators that a principal is potentially working on the
   resource.

<P>The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the
   communications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their
   activities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out of
   band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g., face-to-face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the screen,
   telephone conversation, Email, etc.)  The intent of a shared lock is
   to let collaborators know who else is potentially working on a
   resource.

<P>Shared locks are included because experience from web distributed
   authoring systems has indicated that exclusive write locks are often
   too rigid.  An exclusive write lock is used to enforce a particular
   editing process: take out exclusive write lock, read the resource,
   perform edits, write the resource, release the lock.  This editing
   process has the problem that locks are not always properly released,
   for example when a program crashes, or when a lock owner leaves
   without unlocking a resource.  While both timeouts and
   administrative action can be used to remove an offending lock,
   neither mechanism may be available when needed; the timeout may be
   long or the administrator may not be available.

<P>Despite their potential problems, exclusive write locks are
   extremely useful, since often a guarantee of freedom from overwrite
   conflicts is what is needed. This specification provides both
   exclusive write locks and the less strict mechanism of shared locks.

<h3>5.2. Required Support</h3>

<P>A WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in any
   form.  If the server does support locking it MAY choose to support
   any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any access types.

<P>The reason for this flexibility is that locking policy strikes to
   the very heart of the resource management and versioning systems
   employed by various storage repositories.  These repositories
   require control over what sort of locking will be made available.
   For example, some repositories only support shared write locks while
   others only provide support for exclusive write locks while yet
   others use no locking at all.  As each system is sufficiently
   different to merit exclusion of certain locking features, this
   specification leaves locking as the sole axis of negotiation within
   WebDAV.

<h3>5.3. Lock Tokens</h3>

<P>A lock token is a URI that identifies a particular lock.  A lock
   token is returned by every successful <TT>LOCK</TT> operation in the lock-token response header, and can also be discovered through lock
   discovery on a resource.

<P>Lock token URIs are required to be unique across all resources for
   all time. This uniqueness constraint allows lock tokens to be
   submitted across resources and servers without fear of confusion.

<P>This specification provides a lock token URI scheme called
   opaquelocktoken that meets the uniqueness requirements.  However
   resources are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the
   uniqueness requirements.

<h3>5.4. opaquelocktoken Lock Token URI Scheme</h3>

<P>The opaquelocktoken URI scheme is designed to be unique across all
   resources for all time.  Due to this uniqueness quality, a client
   MAY submit an opaque lock token in a Lock-Token request header and
   an if-state[-not]-match header on a resource other than the one that
   returned it.

<P>All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and, at
   minimum, recognize that the lock token was not generated by the
   resource.  Note, however, that resources are not required to
   generate opaquelocktokens in <TT>LOCK</TT> method responses.

<P>In order to guarantee uniqueness across all resources for all time
   the opaquelocktoken requires the use of the GUID mechanism.

<P>Opaquelocktoken generators, however, have a choice of how they
   create these tokens.  They can either generate a new GUID for every
   lock token they create, which is potentially very expensive, or they
   can create a single GUID and then add extension characters.  If the
   second method is selected then the program generating the extensions
   MUST guarantee that the same extension will never be used twice with
   the associated GUID.

<PRE>   Opaque-Lock-Token = "opaquelocktoken" ":" GUID [Extension]
   GUID = ; As defined in [Leach, Salz, 1997]
   Extension = *urlc   ;urlc is defined in [Berners-Lee et al., 1997]
   (draft-fielding-url-syntax-07.txt)
</PRE>

<h3>5.5. Lock Capability Discovery</h3>

<P>Since server lock support is optional, a client trying to lock a
   resource on a server can either try the lock and hope for the best,
   or perform some form of discovery to determine what lock
   capabilities the server supports.  This is known as lock capability
   discovery.  Lock capability discovery differs from discovery of
   supported access control types, since there may be access control
   types without corresponding lock types.  A client can determine what
   lock types the server supports by retrieving the supportedlock
   property.

<P>Any DAV compliant resource that supports the <TT>LOCK</TT> method MUST
   support the supportedlock property.

<h3>5.6. Active Lock Discovery</h3>

<P>If another principal locks a resource that a principal wishes to
   access, it is useful for the second principal to be able to find out
   who the first principal is.  For this purpose the lockdiscovery
   property is provided.  This property lists all outstanding locks,
   describes their type, and provides their lock token.

<P>Any DAV compliant resource that supports the <TT>LOCK</TT> method MUST
   support the lockdiscovery property.


<h2>6. Write Lock</h2>

<P>This section describes the semantics specific to the write access
   type for locks.  The write lock is a specific instance of a lock
   type, and is the only lock type described in this specification.  A
   DAV compliant resource MAY support the write lock.

<h3>6.1. Methods Restricted by Write Locks</h3>

<P>A write lock prevents a principal without the lock from successfully
   executing a <TT>PUT</TT>, <TT>POST</TT>, <TT>PATCH</TT>, <TT>PROPPATCH</TT>, <TT>MOVE</TT>, <TT>DELETE</TT>, <TT>MKCOL</TT>, <TT>ADDREF</TT>
   or <TT>DELREF</TT> on the locked resource.  All other current methods, <TT>GET</TT> in
   particular, function independent of the lock.

<P>Note, however, that as new methods are created it will be necessary
   to specify how they interact with a write lock.

<h3>6.2. Write Locks and Properties</h3>

<P>While those without a write lock may not alter a property on a
   resource it is still possible for the values of live properties to
   change, even while locked, due to the requirements of their schemas.
   Only dead properties and live properties defined to respect locks
   are guaranteed not to change while write locked.

<h3>6.3. Write Locks and Null Resources</h3>

<P>It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order to
   lock the name.  Please note, however, that locking a null resource
   effectively makes the resource non-null, as the resource now has
   lock related properties defined on it.

<h3>6.4. Write Locks and Collections</h3>

<P>A write lock on a collection prevents the addition or removal of
   members of the collection.  As a consequence, when a principal
   issues a request to create a new internal member of a collection
   using <TT>PUT</TT> or <TT>POST</TT>, or to remove an existing internal member of a
   collection using <TT>DELETE</TT>, this request MUST fail if the principal
   does not have a write lock on the collection.

<P>However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection
   containing internal member resources that are currently locked in a
   manner which conflicts with the write lock, the request MUST fail
   with a 409 Conflict status code.

<h3>6.5. Write Locks and <TT>COPY</TT>/<TT>MOVE</TT></h3>

<P>The owner of a write lock MUST NOT execute a <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a
   resource he has locked.  This specification intentionally does not
   define what happens if a <TT>MOVE</TT> method request is made on a locked
   resource by the lock's owner.

<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> method invocation MUST NOT duplicate any write locks active
   on the source.

<h3>6.6. Re-issuing Write Locks</h3>

<P>If a principal already owns a write lock on a resource, any future
   requests for the same type of write lock, on the same resource,
   while the principal's previous write lock is in effect, MUST result
   in a successful response with the same lock token as provided for
   the currently existing lock.  Two lock requests are defined to be
   identical if their <TT>Lock-Info</TT> headers are identical.

<h3>6.7. Write Locks and The Lock-Token Request Header</h3>

<P>If a user agent is not required to have knowledge about a lock when
   requesting an operation on a locked resource, the following scenario
   might occur.  Program A, run by User A, takes out a write lock on a
   resource.  Program B, also run by User A, has no knowledge of the
   lock taken out by Program A, yet performs a <TT>PUT</TT> to the locked
   resource.  In this scenario, the <TT>PUT</TT> succeeds because locks are
   associated with a principal, not a program, and thus program B,
   because it is acting with principal A's credential, is allowed to
   perform the <TT>PUT</TT>.  However, had program B known about the lock, it
   would not have overwritten the resource, preferring instead to
   present a dialog box describing the conflict to the user.  Due to
   this scenario, a mechanism is needed to prevent different programs
   from accidentally ignoring locks taken out by other programs with
   the same authorization.

<P>In order to prevent these collisions the lock token request header
   is introduced.  Please refer to the Lock Token Request Header
   section for details and requirements.

<h4>6.7.1. Write Lock Token Example</h4>

<PRE>
   COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.ics.uci.edu
   Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html
   Lock-Token: &lt;opaquelocktoken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2&gt;
   &lt;opaquelocktoken:AAAASDFcalkjfdas12312&gt;
</PRE>

<PRE>

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>


<P>In this example, both the source and destination are locked so two
   lock tokens must be submitted.  If only one of the two resources was
   locked, then only one token would have to be submitted.


<h2>7. Notational Conventions</h2>

<P>Since this document describes a set of extensions to the HTTP/1.1
   protocol, the augmented BNF used herein to describe protocol
   elements is exactly the same as described in Section 2.1 of RFC
   2068, <I>Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</I> [Fielding et al.,
   1997].  Since this augmented BNF uses the basic production rules
   provided in Section 2.2 of RFC 2068, these rules apply to this
   document as well.

<P>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   1997].


<h2>8. HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring</h2>

<H3>8.1. <TT>PROPFIND</TT></H3>

<P>The <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method retrieves properties defined on the Request-URI,
   if it is a non-collection resource, or on the Request-URI and
   potentially its member resources, if the resource is a collection.
   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method.

<P>A client MAY submit a <TT>Depth</TT> header with a <TT>PROPFIND</TT> on a collection
   with a value of "0", "1" or "infinity".  DAV compliant servers MUST
   support the "0", "1" and "infinity" behaviors. By default, the
   <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method on a collection without a <TT>Depth</TT> header MUST act as
   if a Depth = infinity header was included.

<P>A client MUST submit a Propfind request header describing what
   information is being requested.  It is possible to request
   particular property values, all property values, or a list of the
   names of the resource's properties.

<P>The response is a text/xml message body that contains a <TT> multistatus</TT>
   XML element that describes the results of the attempts to retrieve
   the various properties.  If a property was successfully retrieved
   then its value MUST be returned in a prop XML element.  If the scope
   of <TT>PROPFIND</TT> covers more than a single resource, as is the case with
   Depth values of "1" and "infinity", each response XML element MUST
   contain an <TT>href</TT> XML element which identifies the resource on which
   the properties in the prop XML element are defined. In the case of
   allprop and propname, if a principal does not have the right to know
   if a particular property exists, an error MUST NOT be returned.  The
   results of this method SHOULD NOT be cached.

<h4>8.1.1. Example: Retrieving Named Properties</h4>

     &lt;D:responsedescription&gt; There has been an access violation error.
     &lt;/D:responsedescription&gt;
     &lt;/D:multistatus&gt;
</PRE>

<P>In this example, <TT>PROPFIND</TT> is executed on the collection
   http://www.foo.bar/files/.  The specified depth is zero, hence the
   <TT>PROPFIND</TT> applies only to the collection itself, and not to any of
   its members.  The <TT>Propfind</TT> header specifies the name of four
   properties whose values are being requested. In this case only two
   properties were returned, since the principal issuing the request
   did not have sufficient access rights to see the third and fourth
   properties.

</PRE>

<P>In this example, <TT>PROPFIND</TT> was invoked on the resource
   http://www.foo.bar/container/ with a <TT>Depth</TT> header of 1, meaning the
   request applies to the resource and its children, and a Propfind
   header of "allprop", meaning the request should return the name and
   value of all properties defined on each resource.

<P>The resource http://www.foo.bar/container/ has two properties
   defined on it, named http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/bigbox, and
   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/author, while resource
   http://www.foo.bar/container/index.html has only a single resource
   defined on it, named http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/bigbox, another
   instance of the "bigbox" property type.

<P>In this example, <TT>PROPFIND</TT> is invoked on the collection resource
   http://www.foo.bar/container/, with a <TT>Propfind</TT> header set to
   "propname", meaning the name of all properties should be returned.
   Since no depth header is present, it assumes its default value of
   "infinity", meaning the name of the properties on the collection and
   all its progeny should be returned.

<P>Consistent with the previous example, resource
   http://www.foo.bar/container/ has two properties defined on it,
   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/bigbox, and
   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/author.  The resource
   http://www.foo.bar/container/index.html, a member of the "container"
   collection, has only one property defined on it,
   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/bigbox.


<H3>8.2. <TT>PROPPATCH</TT></H3>

<P>The <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> method processes instructions specified in the request
   body to set and/or remove properties defined on the resource
   identified by Request-URI.

<P>All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> method and
   MUST process instructions that are specified using the
   propertyupdate, set, and remove XML elements of the DAV schema.
   Execution of the directives in this method is, of course, subject to
   access control constraints.  DAV compliant resources MUST support
   the setting of arbitrary dead properties.

<P>The request message body of a <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> method MUST contain at least
   one propertyupdate XML element.  Instruction processing MUST occur
   in the order instructions are received (i.e., from top to bottom),
   and MUST be performed atomically.

<h4>8.2.1. propertyupdate XML element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>propertyupdate</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To contain a request to alter the properties on a
   resource.
<BR>   Parent:     None
<BR>   Values=     1*(set | remove)
<BR>   Description: This XML element is a container for the information
   required to modify the properties on the resource.  This XML element
   is multi-valued.

<h4>8.2.2. set XML element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>set</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To set the DAV properties specified inside the set XML
   element.
<BR>   Parent:     propertyupdate
<BR>   Values=     prop
<BR>   Description: This XML element MUST contain only a prop XML element.
   The elements contained by prop specify the name and value of
   properties that are set on the Request-URI.  If a property already
   exists then its value is replaced.


<h4>8.2.3. remove XML element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>remove</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To remove the DAV properties specified inside the remove
   XML element.
<BR>   Parent:     propertyupdate
<BR>   Values=     prop
<BR>   Description: Remove specifies that the properties specified in prop
   should be removed.  Specifying the removal of a property that does
   not exist is not an error.  All the elements in prop MUST be empty,
   as only the names of properties to be removed are required.


<h4>8.2.4. Response Codes</h4>

<LI>   200 OK - The command succeeded.  As there can be a mixture of sets
   and removes in a body, a 201 Create seems inappropriate.

<LI>   403 Forbidden - The client, for reasons the server chooses not to
   specify, cannot alter one of the properties.

<LI>   405 Conflict - The client has provided a value whose semantics are
   not appropriate for the property.  This includes trying to set read-only properties.

<LI>   413 Request Entity Too Long - If a particular property is too long
   to be recorded then a composite XML error will be returned
   indicating the offending property.

<h3>8.3. <TT>MKCOL</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>MKCOL</TT> method is used to create a new collection. All DAV
   compliant resources MUST support the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method.

<h4>8.3.1. Request</h4>

<P><TT>MKCOL</TT> creates a new collection resource at the location specified by
   the Request-URI.  If the Request-URI exists, then <TT>MKCOL</TT> must fail.
   During <TT>MKCOL</TT> processing, a server MUST make the Request-URI a member
   of its parent collection.  If no such ancestor exists, the method
   MUST fail.  When the <TT>MKCOL</TT> operation creates a new collection
   resource, all ancestors MUST already exist, or the method MUST fail
   with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example, if a request to
   create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/
   exists, the request MUST fail.

<P>When <TT>MKCOL</TT> is invoked without a request body, the newly created
   collection has no members.

<P>A <TT>MKCOL</TT> request message MAY contain a message body.  The behavior of
   a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request when the body is present is limited to creating
   collections, members of a collection, bodies of members and
   properties on the collections or members.  If the server receives a
   <TT>MKCOL</TT> request entity type it does not support or understand it MUST
   respond with a 415 Unsupported Media Type status code.  The exact
   behavior of <TT>MKCOL</TT> for various request media types is undefined in
   this document, and will be specified in separate documents.

<h4>8.3.2. Response Codes</h4>

<P>Responses from a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request are not cacheable, since <TT>MKCOL</TT> has
   non-idempotent semantics.

<LI>   201 Created - The collection or structured resource was created in
   its entirety.

<LI>   403 Forbidden - This indicates at least one of two conditions: 1)
   The server does not allow the creation of collections at the given
   location in its namespace, and 2) The parent collection of the
   Request-URI exists but cannot accept members.

<LI>   405 Method Not Allowed - <TT>MKCOL</TT> can only be executed on a
   deleted/non-existent resource.

<LI>   409 Conflict - A collection cannot be made at the Request-URI until
   one or more intermediate collections have been created.

<LI>   415 Unsupported Media Type- The server does not support the request
   type of the body.

<LI>   419 Insufficient Space on Resource - The resource does not have
   sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the
   execution of this method.

<h4>8.3.3. Example</h4>

<P>This example creates a collection called /webdisc/xfiles/ on the
   server www.server.org.

<h3>8.4. <TT>INDEX</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>INDEX</TT> method is used to enumerate the members of a resource.
   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>INDEX</TT> method if they
   have members.

<h4>8.4.1. The Request</h4>

<P>For a collection, <TT>INDEX</TT> MUST return a list of its members.  All
   WebDAV compliant resources MUST support the text/xml response entity
   described below.  The <TT>INDEX</TT> result for a collection MAY also return
   a list of the members of child collections, to any depth.

<P>Collections that respond to an <TT>INDEX</TT> method with a text/xml entity
   MUST contain a single <TT> multistatus</TT> XML element which contains a
   response XML element for each member.

<P>A resource that supports <TT>INDEX</TT> MUST return the <TT>resourcetype</TT> property
   for each member.

<P>Note that the prop XML element MAY contain additional properties.

<h3>8.5. <TT>ADDREF</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>ADDREF</TT> method is used to add external members to a resource.
   All DAV compliant collection resources MUST support the <TT>ADDREF</TT>
   method.  All other DAV compliant resources MAY support the <TT>ADDREF</TT>
   method as appropriate.

<h4>8.5.1. The Request</h4>

<P>The <TT>ADDREF</TT> method adds the URI specified in the Collection-Member
   header as an external member to the collection specified by the
   Request-URI.  The value in the <TT>Collection-Member</TT> header MUST be an
   absolute URI meeting the requirements of an external member URI.

<P>It is not an error if the URI specified in the Collection-Member
   header already exists as an external member of the collection.
   However, after processing the <TT>ADDREF</TT> there MUST be only one instance
   of the URI in the collection.  If the URI specified in the
   <TT>Collection-Member</TT> header already exists as an internal member of the
   collection, the <TT>ADDREF</TT> method MUST fail with a 412 Precondition
   Failed status code.

<h4>8.5.2. Example</h4>

<PRE>
   ADDREF /~ejw/dav/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.ics.uci.edu
   Collection-Member: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
</PRE>

<PRE>

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>


<P>This example adds the URI http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/ as an
   external member resource of the collection
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/dav/.


<h3>8.6. <TT>DELREF</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>DELREF</TT> method is used to remove external members from a
   resource.  All DAV compliant collection resources MUST support the
   <TT>DELREF</TT> method.  All other DAV compliant resources MUST support the
   <TT>DELREF</TT> method only if they support the <TT>ADDREF</TT> method.

<h4>8.6.1. The Request</h4>

<P>The <TT>DELREF</TT> method removes the URI specified in the Collection-Member
   header from the collection specified by the Request-URI.

<P>DELREFing a URI which is not a member of the collection is not an
   error.  DELREFing an internal member MUST fail with a 412
   Precondition Failed status code.

<h4>8.6.2. Example</h4>

<PRE>
   <TT>DELREF</TT> /~ejw/dav/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.ics.udi.edu
   Collection-Member: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
</PRE>

<PRE>

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>

<P>This example removes the URI http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/, an
   external member resource, from the collection
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/dav/.


<h3>8.7. <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT> for Collections</h3>

<P>The semantics of <TT>GET</TT> are unchanged when applied to a collection,
   since <TT>GET</TT> is defined as, "retrieve whatever information (in the form
   of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI" [Fielding et al.,
   1997].  <TT>GET</TT> when applied to a collection MAY return the contents of
   an "index.html" resource, a human-readable view of the contents of
   the collection, or something else altogether, and hence it is
   possible the result of a <TT>GET</TT> on a collection will bear no
   correlation to the state of the collection.

<P>Similarly, since the definition of <TT>HEAD</TT> is a <TT>GET</TT> without a response
   message body, the semantics of <TT>HEAD</TT> are unmodified when applied to
   collection resources.

<h3>8.8. <TT>POST</TT> for Collections</h3>

<P>Since by definition the actual function performed by <TT>POST</TT> is
   determined by the server and often depends on the particular
   resource, the behavior of <TT>POST</TT> when applied to collections cannot be
   meaningfully modified because it is largely undefined.  Thus the
   semantics of <TT>POST</TT> are unmodified when applied to a collection.

<H3>8.9. <TT>DELETE</TT></H3>

<h4>8.9.1. <TT>DELETE</TT> Method for Non-Collection Resources</h4>

<P>If the <TT>DELETE</TT> method is issued to a non-collection resource which is
   an internal member of a collection, then during <TT>DELETE</TT> processing a
   server MUST remove the Request-URI from its parent collection.  A
   server MAY remove the URI of a deleted resource from any collections
   of which the resource is an external member.

<h4>8.9.2. <TT>DELETE</TT> for Collections</h4>

<P>The <TT>DELETE</TT> method on a collection MUST act as if a Depth = Infinity
   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a <TT>Depth</TT> header on a
   <TT>DELETE</TT> on a collection with any value but Infinity.

<P><TT>DELETE</TT> instructs that the collection specified in the request-URI,
   the records of its external member resources, and all its internal
   member resources, are to be deleted.

<P>If any member cannot be deleted then all of the member's progeny
   MUST NOT be deleted, so as to maintain the namespace.

<P>Any headers included with <TT>DELETE</TT> MUST be applied in processing every
   resource to be deleted.  In this case, a header of special interest
   is the <TT>Destroy</TT> header, which specifies the method to be used to
   delete all resources in the scope of the <TT>DELETE</TT>.

<P>When the <TT>DELETE</TT> method has completed processing it MUST return a
   consistent namespace.

<P>The response SHOULD be a Multi-Status response that describes the
   result of the <TT>DELETE</TT> on each affected resource.

<h4>8.9.2.1. Example</h4>

<PRE>
   DELETE  /container/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.foo.bar
   Destroy: NoUndelete

     &lt;d:response&gt;
          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/resource1&lt;/d:href&gt;
          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/resource2&lt;/d:href&gt;
          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;/d:status&gt;
     &lt;/d:response&gt;
     &lt;d:response&gt;
          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/&lt;/d:href&gt;
          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 420 Method Failure&lt;/d:status&gt;
     &lt;/d:response&gt;
     &lt;d:response&gt;
          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/resource3&lt;/d:href&gt;
          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed&lt;/d:status&gt;
     &lt;/d:response&gt;
   &lt;/d:multistatus&gt;
</PRE>

<P>In this example the attempt to delete
   http://www.foo.bar/container/resource3 failed because the server was
   unable to guarantee that resource3 would not be able to be
   undeleted.  Consequently, the attempt to delete
   http://www.foo.bar/container/ also failed, but resource1 and
   resource2 were deleted. Even though a <TT>Depth</TT> header has not been
   included, a depth of infinity is assumed because the method is on a
   collection. As this example illustrates, <TT>DELETE</TT> processing need not
   be atomic.

<H3>8.10. <TT>PUT</TT></H3>

<h4>8.10.1. <TT>PUT</TT> for Non-Collection Resources</h4>

<P>A <TT>PUT</TT> performed on an existing resource replaces the <TT>GET</TT> response
   entity of the resource.  Properties defined on the resource MAY be
   recomputed during <TT>PUT</TT> processing.  For example, if a server
   recognizes the content type of the request body, it may be able to
   automatically extract information that could be profitably exposed
   as properties.

<P>A <TT>PUT</TT> that would result in the creation of a resource without an
   appropriately scoped parent collection MUST fail with a 405 Method
   Not Allowed.

<h4>8.10.2. <TT>PUT</TT> for Collections</h4>

<P>As defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification [Fielding et al., 1997],
   the "<TT>PUT</TT> method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under
   the supplied Request-URI."  Since submission of an entity
   representing a collection would implicitly encode creation and
   deletion of resources, this specification intentionally does not
   define a transmission format for creating a collection using <TT>PUT</TT>.
   Instead, the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method is defined to create collections.  If a
   <TT>PUT</TT> is invoked on a collection resource it MUST fail.

<P>When the <TT>PUT</TT> operation creates a new non-collection resource all
   ancestors MUST already exist.  If all ancestors do not exist, the
   method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example, if
   resource /a/b/c/d.html is to be created and /a/b/c/ does not exist,
   then the request must fail.

<h3>8.11. <TT>COPY</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>COPY</TT> method creates a duplicate of the specified resource.  All
   DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>COPY</TT> method.

<P>Support for the <TT>COPY</TT> method does not guarantee the ability to copy a
   resource. For example, separate programs may control resources on
   the same server.  As a result, it may not even be possible to copy a
   resource to a location that appears to be on the same server.

<h4>8.11.1. The Request</h4>

<P>The <TT>COPY</TT> method creates a duplicate of the source resource, given by
   the Request-URI, in the destination resource, given by the
   <TT>Destination</TT> header.  The <TT>Destination</TT> header MUST be present.  The
   exact behavior of the <TT>COPY</TT> method depends on the type of the source
   resource.

<h4>8.11.1.1. <TT>COPY</TT> for HTTP/1.1 resources</h4>

<P>When the source resource is not a collection the body of the
   destination resource MUST be octet-for-octet identical to the body
   of the source resource.  Alterations to the destination resource do
   not modify the source resource.  Alterations to the source resource
   do not modify the destination resource.  Thus, all copies are
   performed "by-value".

<P>All properties on the source resource MUST be duplicated on the
   destination resource, subject to modifying headers, following the
   definition for copying properties.

<h4>8.11.1.2. <TT>COPY</TT> for Properties</h4>

<P>The following section defines how properties on a resource are
   handled during a <TT>COPY</TT> operation.

<P>Live properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live
   properties at the destination resource.  Since they are live
   properties, the server determines the syntax and semantics of these
   properties.  Properties named by the <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header
   MUST be live on the destination resource, or the method MUST fail.
   If a property is not named by Enforce-Live-Properties and cannot be
   copied live, then its value MUST be duplicated, octet-for-octet, in
   an identically named, dead property on the destination resource.

<P>If a property on the source already exists on the destination
   resource and the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is set to "T" then the property at
   the destination MUST be overwritten with the property from the
   source.  If the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is "F" and the previous situation
   exists, then the <TT>COPY</TT> MUST fail with a 409 Conflict.

<h4>8.11.1.3. <TT>COPY</TT> for Collections</h4>

<P>The <TT>COPY</TT> method on a collection without a <TT>Depth</TT> header MUST act as
   if a Depth = infinity header was included.  A client MAY submit a
   <TT>Depth</TT> header on a <TT>COPY</TT> on a collection with a value of "0" or
   "infinity".  DAV compliant servers MUST support the "0" and
   "infinity" behaviors.

<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> of depth infinity instructs that the collection specified in
   the Request-URI, the records of its external member resources, and
   all its internal member resources, are to be copied to a location
   relative to the <TT>Destination</TT> header.

<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> of depth "0" only instructs that the collection, the
   properties, and its external members, not its internal members, are
   to be copied.

<P>Any headers included with a <TT>COPY</TT> are to be applied in processing
   every resource to be copied.

<P>The exception to this rule is the <TT>Destination</TT> header. This header
   only specifies the destination for the Request-URI.  When applied to
   members of the collection specified in the request-URI the value of
   Destination is to be modified to reflect the current location in the
   hierarchy.  So, if the request-URI is "a" and the destination is "b"
   then when a/c/d is processed it MUST use a destination of b/c/d.

<P>When the <TT>COPY</TT> method has completed processing it MUST have created a
   consistent namespace at the destination.  Thus if it is not possible
   to <TT>COPY</TT> a collection with internal members, the internal members may
   still be copied but a collection will have to be created at the
   destination to contain them.

<P>The response is a Multi-Status response that describes the result of
   the <TT>COPY</TT> on each affected resource.  The response is given for the
   resource that was to be copied, not the resource that was created as
   a result of the copy.  In other words, each entry indicates whether
   the copy on the resource specified in the <TT>href</TT> succeeded or failed
   and why.

<P>The exception to this rule is for errors that occurred on the
   destination.  For example, if the destination was locked the
   response would indicate the destination URL and a 421 Destination
   Locked error.

<h4>8.11.1.4. Type Interactions</h4>

<P>If the destination resource identifies a collection and the
   <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is "T", prior to performing the copy the server
   MUST perform a <TT>DELETE</TT> operation on the collection.

<h4>8.11.2. Response Codes</h4>

<LI>200 OK - The source resource was successfully copied to a pre-existing destination resource.

<LI>201 Created - The source resource was successfully copied.  The copy
   operation resulted in the creation of a new resource.

<LI>412 Precondition Failed - This status code MUST be returned if the
   server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties listed
   in the <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header, or if the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is
   "F", and the state of the destination resource is non-null.

<LI>419 Insufficient Space on Resource - The destination resource does
   not have sufficient space to record the state of the resource after
   the execution of this method.

<LI>421 Destination Locked - The destination resource was locked and
   either a valid <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header was not submitted, or the <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header identifies a lock held by another principal.

<LI>500 Server Error - The resource was in such a state that it could
   not be copied.  This may occur if the <TT>Destination</TT> header specifies a
   resource that is outside the namespace the resource is able to
   interact with.

<h4>8.11.3. Overwrite Example</h4>

<P>This example shows resource
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being copied to the

<P>The <TT>Depth</TT> header is unnecessary as the default behavior of <TT>COPY</TT> on a
   collection is to act as if a "Depth: Infinity" header had been
   submitted.  In this example most of the resources, along with the
   collection, were copied successfully. However the collection R2
   failed, most likely due to a problem with enforcing live properties.
   R2's member D2 was successfully copied.  As a result a collection
   was created at www.foo.bar/othercontainer/R2 to contain D2.

<h3>8.12. <TT>MOVE</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a copy
   followed by a delete, where the actions are performed atomically.
   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>MOVE</TT> method.

<P>However, support for the <TT>MOVE</TT> method does not guarantee the ability
   to move a resource to a particular destination. For example,
   separate programs may actually control different sets of resources
   on the same server.  Therefore, it may not even be possible to move
   a resource within a namespace that appears to belong to the same
   server.

<h4>8.12.1. The Request</h4>

<P>If a resource exists at the destination, the destination resource
   will be DELETEd as a side effect of the <TT>MOVE</TT> operation, subject to
   the restrictions of the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header.

<h4>8.12.2. <TT>MOVE</TT> for Collections</h4>

<P><TT>MOVE</TT> instructs that the collection specified in the Request-URI, the
   records of its external member resources, and all its internal
   member resources, are to be moved to a location relative to the
   <TT>Destination</TT> header.

<P>The <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a collection MUST act as if a Depth "infinity"
   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a <TT>Depth</TT> header on a
   <TT>MOVE</TT> on a collection with any value but "infinity".

<P>Any headers included with <TT>MOVE</TT> are to be applied in processing every
   resource to be moved.

<P>The exception to this rule is the <TT>Destination</TT> header.  The behavior
   of this header is the same as given for <TT>COPY</TT> on collections.

<P>When the <TT>MOVE</TT> method has completed processing it MUST have created a
   consistent namespace on both the source and destination, creating
   collections at the source or destination as necessary.

<P>As specified in the definition of <TT>MOVE</TT>, a <TT>MOVE</TT> of a collection over
   another collection causes the destination collection and all its
   members to be deleted.

<P>The response is a Multi-Status response that describes the result of
   the <TT>MOVE</TT> on each affected resource.  The response is given for the
   resource that was to be moved, not the resource that was created as
   a result of the move.  In other words, each entry indicates whether
   the move on the resource specified in the <TT>href</TT> succeeded or failed
   and why.

<P>The exception to this rule is for errors that occurred on the
   destination.  For example, if the destination was locked the
   response would indicate the destination URL and a 421 Destination
   Locked error.

<h4>8.12.3. Response Codes</h4>

<LI>   200 OK - The move operation was successful.

<LI>   409 Conflict - The <TT>MOVE</TT> was attempted on a collection with members.
   While the <TT>COPY</TT> part of this operation could succeed the <TT>DELETE</TT> could
   not.  Therefore the <TT>MOVE</TT> MUST fail.

<LI>   412 Precondition Failed - This status code MUST be returned if the
   server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties listed
   in the <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header, or if the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is
   "F", and the state of the destination resource is non-null.

<LI>   421 Destination Locked - The destination resource was locked and
   either a valid <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header was not submitted, or the <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header identifies a lock held by another principal.

<LI>   502 Bad Gateway - This may occur when the destination is on another
   server and the destination server refuses to accept the resource

<h4>8.12.4. Overwrite Example</h4>

<P>This example shows resource
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being moved to the
   location http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html.  The
   contents of the destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.

<P>In this example the client has submitted a number of lock tokens
   with the request.  A lock token will need to be submitted for every
   resource, both source and destination, anywhere in the scope of the
   method, that is locked.  In this case the proper lock token was not
   submitted for the destination http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/C2.
   This means that the resource continer/c2 could not be moved,
   although its child container/C2/R2 could be moved.

<h3>8.13. <TT>LOCK</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The following sections describe the <TT>LOCK</TT> method, which is used to
   take out a lock of any access type.  These sections on the <TT>LOCK</TT>
   method describe only those semantics that are specific to the <TT>LOCK</TT>
   method and are independent of the access type of the lock being
   requested.  Once the general <TT>LOCK</TT> method has been described,
   subsequent sections describe the semantics of the "write" access
   type, and the write lock.

<h4>8.13.1. Operation</h4>

<P>A <TT>LOCK</TT> method invocation creates the lock specified by the Lock-Info
   header on the Request-URI.  Lock method requests SHOULD have a XML
   request body which contains an Owner XML element for this lock
   request. The <TT>LOCK</TT> request MAY have a <TT>Timeout</TT> header.

<P>A successful response to a lock invocation MUST include <TT>Lock-Token</TT>
   and <TT>Timeout</TT> headers.  Clients MUST assume that locks may arbitrarily
   disappear at any time, regardless of the value given in the Timeout
   header.  The <TT>Timeout</TT> header only indicates the behavior of the
   server if "extraordinary" circumstances do not occur.  For example,
   an administrator may remove a lock at any time or the system may
   crash in such a way that it loses the record of the lock's
   existence. The response MUST also contain the value of the
   lockdiscovery property in a prop XML element.

<h4>8.13.2. The Effect of Locks on Properties and Collections</h4>

<P>By default the scope of a lock is the entire state of the resource,
   including its body and associated properties.  As a result, a lock
   on a resource also locks the resource's properties, and a lock on a
   property may lock a property's resource or may restrict the ability
   to lock the property's resource.  Only a single lock token MUST be
   used when a lock extends to cover both a resource and its
   properties.  Note that certain lock types MAY override this
   behavior.

<P>For collections, a lock also affects the ability to add or remove
   members.  The nature of the effect depends upon the type of access
   control involved.

<h4>8.13.3. Locking Replicated Resources</h4>

<P>Some servers automatically replicate resources across multiple URLs.
   In such a circumstance the server MAY only accept a lock on one of
   the URLs if the server can guarantee that the lock will be honored
   across all the URLs.

<h4>8.13.4. Locking Multiple Resources</h4>

<P>The <TT>LOCK</TT> method supports locking multiple resources simultaneously
   by allowing for the listing of several URIs in the <TT>LOCK</TT> request.
   These URIs, in addition to the Request-URI, are then to be locked as
   a result of the <TT>LOCK</TT> method's invocation.  When multiple resources
   are specified the <TT>LOCK</TT> method only succeeds if all specified
   resources are successfully locked.

<P>The Lock-Tree option of the lock request specifies that the resource
   and all its internal children (including internal collections, and
   their internal members) are to be locked.  This is another mechanism
   by which a request for a lock on multiple resources can be
   specified.

<P>Currently existing locks can not be extended to cover more or less
   resources, and any request to expand or contract the number of
   resources in a lock MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code. So,
   for example, if resource A is exclusively write locked and then the
   same principal asks to exclusively write lock resources A, B, and C,
   the request will fail as A is already locked and the lock can not be
   extended.

<P>A successful result will return a single lock token which represents
   all the resources that have been locked.  If an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> is executed
   on this token, all associated resources are unlocked.

<P>If the lock cannot be granted to all resources, a 409 Conflict
   status code MUST be returned with a response entity body containing
   a <TT> multistatus</TT> XML element describing which resource(s) prevented the
   lock from being granted.

<h4>8.13.5. Interaction with other Methods</h4>

<P>The interaction of a <TT>LOCK</TT> with various methods is dependent upon the
   lock type.  However, independent of lock type, a successful <TT>DELETE</TT>
   of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed.

<h4>8.13.6. Lock Compatibility Table</h4>

<P>The table below describes the behavior that occurs when a lock
   request is made on a resource.

<table>
<TR><TH>   Current lock state/<BR>   Lock request<TH>      Shared Lock<TH>       Exclusive<BR>Lock</TR>
<TR><TD>   None<TD>                     True<TD>              True</TR>
<TR><TD>  Shared Lock<TD>              True<TD>              False</TR>
<TR><TD>   Exclusive Lock<TD>           False <TD>            False*</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Legend: True = lock MAY be granted.  False = lock MUST NOT be
   granted.  *=if the principal requesting the lock is the owner of the
   lock, the lock MAY be regranted.

<P>The current lock state of a resource is given in the leftmost
   column, and lock requests are listed in the first row.  The
   intersection of a row and column gives the result of a lock request.
   For example, if a shared lock is held on a resource, and an
   exclusive lock is requested, the table entry is "false", indicating
   the lock must not be granted.

<P>If an exclusive or shared lock is re-requested by the principal who
   owns the lock, the lock MUST be regranted.  If the lock is
   regranted, the same lock token that was previously issued MUST be
   returned.

<h4>8.13.7. Owner XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>owner</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    Provide information about the principal taking out a
   lock.
<BR>   Parent:     Any
<BR>   Values:          XML Elements
   Descripton: The Owner XML element provides information sufficient
   for either directly contacting a principal (such as a telephone
   number or Email URI), or for discovering the principal (such as the
   URL of a homepage) who owns a lock.

<h4>8.13.8. Lock Response</h4>

<P>A successful lock response MUST contain a Lock-Token response
   header, a <TT>Timeout</TT> header and a prop XML element in the response body
   which contains the value of the lockdiscovery property.

<h4>8.13.9. Response Codes</h4>

<LI>   409 Conflict - The resource is locked, so the method has been
   rejected.

<LI>   412 Precondition Failed - The included Lock-Token was not
   enforceable on this resource or the server could not satisfy the
   request in the <TT>Lock-Info</TT> header.

   http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc.  The
   resource http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/contact.html contains contact
   information for the owner of the lock.  The server has an activity-based timeout policy in place on this resource, which causes the
   lock to automatically be removed after 1 week (604800 seconds).  The

</PRE>

<P>This example shows a request for an exclusive write lock on three
   resources, http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc,
   http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/, and http://foo.bar/blah.  In
   this request, the client has specified that it desires an infinite
   length lock, if available, otherwise a timeout of 4.1 billion
   seconds, if available.  The <TT>Owner</TT> header field specifies the web
   address for contact information for the principal taking out the
   lock.

<P>This lock request has failed, because the server rejected the lock
   request for http://foo.bar/blah.  The 409 Conflict status code
   indicates that the server was unable to satisfy the request because
   there is a conflict between the state of the resources and the
   operation named in the request.  Within the <TT> multistatus</TT>, the 202
   Accepted status code indicates that the lock method was accepted by
   the resources, and would have been completed if all resources named
   in the request were able to be locked.  The 403 Forbidden status
   code indicates that the server does not allow lock requests on this
   resource.

<h3>8.14. <TT>UNLOCK</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method removes the lock identified by the lock token in
   the <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header from the Request-URI, and all other resources
   included in the lock.

<P>Any DAV compliant resource which supports the <TT>LOCK</TT> method MUST
   support the <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method.

<h4>8.14.1. Example</h4>

<PRE>
   UNLOCK /workspace/webdav/info.doc HTTP/1.1
   Host: webdav.sb.aol.com
   Lock-Token:opaquelocktoken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2
</PRE>
<PRE>
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>


<P>In this example, the lock identified by the lock token
   "opaquelocktoken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2" is successfully removed from
   the resource http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/info.doc.  If
   this lock included more than just one resource, the lock was removed
   from those resources as well.

<h3>8.15. <TT>PATCH</TT> Method</h3>

<P>The <TT>PATCH</TT> method is used to modify parts of the entity returned in
   the response to a <TT>GET</TT> method.  DAV compliant resources MAY support
   the <TT>PATCH</TT> method.

<h4>8.15.1. The Request</h4>

<P>The request entity of the <TT>PATCH</TT> method contains a list of
   differences between the resource identified by the Request-URI and
   the desired content of the resource after the <TT>PATCH</TT> action has been
   applied.  The list of differences is in a format defined by the
   media type of the entity (e.g., "application/diff") and must include
   sufficient information to allow the server to convert the original
   version of the resource to the desired version.  Processing
   performed by <TT>PATCH</TT> is atomic.  Hence all changes MUST be
   successfully executed or the method fails.  <TT>PATCH</TT> MUST fail if
   executed on a non-existent resource; i.e., <TT>PATCH</TT> does not create a
   resource as a side effect.

<P>If the request appears (at least initially) to be acceptable, the
   server MUST transmit an interim 100 response message after receiving
   the empty line terminating the request headers and continue
   processing the request.  Since the semantics of <TT>PATCH</TT> are non-idempotent, responses to this method are not cacheable.

<P>While server support for <TT>PATCH</TT> is optional, if a server does support
   <TT>PATCH</TT>, it MUST support at least the text/xml diff format defined
   below.  Support for the VTML difference format [VTML] is
   recommended, but not required.

<h4>8.15.2. text/xml elements for <TT>PATCH</TT></h4>

<P>The resourceupdate XML element contains a set of XML sub-entities
   that describe modification operations.  The name and meaning of
   these XML elements are given below.  Processing of these directives
   MUST be performed in the order encountered within the XML document.
   A directive operates on the resource as modified by all previous
   directives (executed in sequential order).  The length of the
   resource MAY be extended or reduced by a <TT>PATCH</TT>.

<P>The changes specified by the resourceupdate XML element MUST be
   executed atomically.

<h4>8.15.2.1. resourceupdate XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>resourceupdate</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>   Purpose:    Contains an ordered set of changes to a non-collection,
   non-property resource.
<BR>   Parent:     None
<BR>   Value=      *(insert | delete | replace)


<h4>8.15.2.2. insert XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>insert</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>   Purpose:    Insert the XML element's contents starting at the
   specified octet.
<BR>   Parent:     resourceupdate
<BR>   Value:      The insert XML element MUST contain an octet-range XML
   attribute that specifies an octet position within the body of a
   resource.  A value of "end" specifies the end of the resource.  The
   body of the insert XML element contains the octets to be inserted.

<P>Please note that in order to protect the white space contained in
   this XML element the following attribute/value MUST be included in
   the element: XML-SPACE = "PRESERVE". This attribute is defined in
   the XML specification [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, 1997].

<h4>8.15.2.3. delete XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>delete</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>   Purpose:    Removes the specified range of octets.
<BR>   Parent:     resourceupdate
<BR>   Value:      The delete XML element MUST contain an octet-range XML
   attribute.

<P>Discussion: The octets that are deleted are removed, which means the
   resource is collapsed and the length of the resource is decremented
   by the size of the octet range.  It is not appropriate to replace
   deleted octets with zeroed-out octets, since zero is a valid octet
   value.

<h4>8.15.2.4. replace XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>replace</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>   Purpose:    Replaces the specified range of octets with the contents
   of the XML element.  If the number of octets in the XML element is
   different from the number of octets specified, the update MUST be
   rejected.
<BR>   Parent:     resourceupdate
<BR>   Value:      The replace XML element MUST contain an octet-range XML
   attribute.  The contents of the entity are the replacement octets.

<P>Please note that in order to protect the white space contained in
   this XML element the following attribute/value MUST be included in
   the element: XML-SPACE = "PRESERVE"
                                     .

                                       This attribute is defined in the
   XML specification [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, 1997].

<h4>8.15.2.5. octet-range Attribute</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>octet-range</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>   Purpose:    Specifies a range of octets that the enclosing property
   affects.
<BR>   Parent:     insert | delete | replace
<BR>   Value:      number ["-" (number | "end")]
               Number = 1*Digit

<BR>   Description: Octet numbering begins with 0.  If the octet contains a
   single number then the operation is to begin at that octet and to
   continue for a length specified by the operation.  In the case of a
   delete, this would mean to delete a single octet.  In the case of an
   insert this would mean to begin the insertion at the specified octet
   and to continue for the length of the included value, extending the
   resource if necessary.  In the case of replace, the replace begins
   at the specified octet and overwrites all that follow to the length
   of the included value.

<h4>8.15.3. Response Codes</h4>

<LI>200 OK - The request entity body was processed without error,
   resulting in an update to the state of the resource.

<LI>409 Conflict - If the update information in the request message body
   does not make sense given the current state of the resource (e.g.,
   an instruction to delete a non-existent line), this status code MAY
   be returned.

<LI>415 Unsupported Media Type - The server does not support the content
   type of the update instructions in the request message body.

<LI>418 Unprocessable Entity - The entity body submitted with the <TT>PATCH</TT>
   was not understood by the resource.

<LI>419 Insufficient Space on Resource - The resource does not have
   sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the
   execution of this method.

<h2>9. HTTP Headers for Distributed Authoring</h2>

<h3>9.1. Collection-Member Header</h3>

<PRE>   CollectionMember = "Collection-Member" ":" URI   ; URI is defined in
   section 3.2.1 of [Fielding et al., 1997]
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Collection-Member</TT> header specifies the URI of an external
   resource to be added/deleted to/from a collection.

<h3>9.2. DAV Header</h3>

<PRE>   DAV = "DAV" ":" ("1" | "2" | extend)
</PRE>

<P>This header indicates that the resource supports the DAV schema and
   protocol to the level indicated.  All DAV compliant resources MUST
   return the <TT>DAV</TT> header on all <TT>OPTIONS</TT> responses.

<h3>9.3. Depth Header</h3>

<PRE>   Depth = "Depth" ":" ("0" | "1" | "infinity")
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Depth</TT> header is used with methods executed on collections to
   indicate whether the method is to be applied only to the collection
   (Depth = 0), to the collection and its immediate children, (Depth =
   1), or the collection and all its progeny (Depth = infinity).  Note
   that Depth = 1 and Depth = infinity behavior only applies to
   internal member resources, and not to external member resources.

<P>The <TT>Depth</TT> header is only supported if a method's definition
   explicitly provides for such support.

<P>The following rules are the default behavior for any method that
   supports the depth header. A method MAY override these defaults by
   defining different behavior in its definition.

<P>Methods which support the depth header MAY choose not to support all
   of the header's values and MAY define, on a case by case basis, the
   behavior of the method on a collection if a depth header is not
   present. For example, the <TT>MOVE</TT> method only supports Depth = infinity
   and if a depth header is not present will act as if a Depth =
   infinity header had been applied.

<P>Clients MUST NOT rely upon methods executing on members of their
   hierarchies in any particular order or the execution being atomic.
   Note that methods MAY provide guarantees on ordering and atomicity.

<P>Upon execution, a method with a depth header will perform as much of
   its assigned task as possible and then return a response specifying
   what it was able to accomplish and what it failed to do.

<P>So, for example, an attempt to <TT>COPY</TT> a hierarchy may result in some
   of the members being copied and some not.

<P>Any headers on a method with a depth header MUST be applied to all
   resources in the scope of the method. For example, an if-match
   header will have its value applied against every resource in the
   method's scope and will cause the method to fail if the header fails
   to match.

<P>If a resource, source or destination, within the scope of the method
   is locked in such a way as to prevent the successful execution of
   the method, then the lock token for that resource MUST be submitted
   with the request in the Lock-Token request header.

<h3>9.4. Destination Header</h3>

<PRE>   Destination = "Destination" ":" URI
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Destination</TT> header specifies a destination resource for methods
   such as <TT>COPY</TT> and <TT>MOVE</TT>, which take two URIs as parameters.

<h3>9.5. Destroy Header</h3>

<PRE>   DestroyHeader = "Destroy" ":" #Choices
</PRE>

<PRE>   Choices = "VersionDestroy" | "NoUndelete" | "Undelete" | extend
</PRE>

<PRE>   Extend = RFC-Reg | Coded-URL
</PRE>

<PRE>   RFC-Req = Token ; This is a token value (defined in section 2.2 of
   [Fielding et al., 1997]) that has been published as an RFC.
</PRE>

<PRE>   Coded-URL = "&lt;" URI "&gt;"
</PRE>

<P>When deleting a resource the client often wishes to specify exactly
   what sort of delete should be performed.  The <TT>Destroy</TT> header, used
   with the <TT>Mandatory</TT> header, allows the client to specify the end
   result it desires.  The <TT>Destroy</TT> header is specified as follows:

<P>The Undelete token requests that, if possible, the resource should
   be left in a state such that it can be undeleted.  The server is not
   required to honor this request.

<P>The NoUndelete token requests that the resource MUST NOT be left in
   a state such that it can be undeleted.

<P>The VersionDestroy token includes the functionality of the
   NoUndelete token and extends it to include having the server remove
   all versioning references to the resource that it has control over.

<h3>9.6. Enforce-Live-Properties Header</h3>

<PRE>   EnforceLiveProperties = "Enforce-Live-Properties" ":" ("*" | "Omit"
   | 1*(Property-Name))
</PRE>

<PRE>   Property-Name = Coded-URL
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header specifies properties that MUST be
   "live" after they are copied (moved) to the destination resource of
   a copy (or move).  If the value "*" is given for the header, then it
   designates all live properties on the source resource.  If the value
   is "Omit" then the server MUST NOT duplicate on the destination
   resource any properties that are defined on the source resource.  If
   this header is not included then the server is expected to act as
   defined by the default property handling behavior of the associated
   method.

<h3>9.7. If-None-State-Match</h3>

<PRE>   If-None-State-Match = "If-None-State-Match" ":" 1#Coded-URL
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>If-None-State-Match</TT> header is intended to have similar
   functionality to the <TT>If-None-Match</TT> header defined in section 14.26
   of RFC 2068.  However the if-none-state-match header is intended for
   use with any URI which represents state information about a
   resource, referred to as a state token.  A typical example is a lock
   token.

<P>If any of the state tokens identifies the current state of the
   resource, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method.
   Instead, if the request method was <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT>, <TT>INDEX</TT>, or <TT>PROPFIND</TT>,
   the server SHOULD respond with a 304 Not Modified response,
   including the cache-related entity-header fields (particularly ETag)
   of the current state of the resource.  For all other request
   methods, the server MUST respond with a status of 412 Precondition
   Failed.

<P>If none of the state tokens identifies the current state of the
   resource, the server MAY perform the requested method.

<P>If any of the tokens is not recognized then the method MUST fail
   with a 412 Precondition Failed.

<P>Note that the "AND" and "OR" keywords specified with the <TT>If-State-Match</TT> header are intentionally not defined for If-None-State-Match,
   because this functionality is not required.

<h3>9.8. If-State-Match</h3>

<PRE>   If-State-Match = "If-State-Match" ":" ("AND" | "OR") 1#Coded-URL
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>If-State-Match</TT> header is intended to have similar functionality
   to the <TT>If-Match</TT> header defined in section 14.25 of RFC 2068.
   However the <TT>If-State-Match</TT> header is intended for use with any URI
   which represents state information about a resource.  A typical
   example is a lock token.

<P>If the AND keyword is used and all of the state tokens identify the
   state of the resource, then the server MAY perform the requested
   method.  If the OR keyword is used and any of the state tokens
   identifies the current state of the resource, then the server MAY
   perform the requested method.  If the keyword requirement for the
   the keyword used is not met, the server MUST NOT perform the
   requested method, and MUST return a 412 Precondition Failed
   response.

<P>If any of the tokens is not recognized then the method MUST fail
   with a 412 Precondition Failed.

<h3>9.9. Lock-Info Request Header</h3>

<PRE>   LockInfo = "Lock-Info" ":" DAVLockType SP DAVLockScope [SP
   AdditionalLocks] [SP Lock-Tree]
   DAVLockType = "LockType" "=" DAVLockTypeValue
   DAVLockTypeValue = ("Write" | Extend)
   DAVLockScope = "LockScope" "=" DAVLockScopeValue
   DAVLockScopeValue = ("Exclusive" |"Shared" | Extend)
   AdditionalLocks = "AddLocks" "=" 1*("&lt;" URI "&gt;")
   Lock-Tree = "Lock-Tree" "=" ("T" | "F")
</PRE>

<P>The Lock-Info request header specifies the scope and type of a lock
   for a <TT>LOCK</TT> method request.  The syntax specification below is
   extensible, allowing new type and scope identifiers to be added.

<P>The LockType field specifies the access type of the lock.  At
   present, this specification only defines one lock type, the "Write"
   lock.  The LockScope field specifies whether the lock is an
   exclusive lock, or a shared lock.  The AddLocks field specifies
   additional URIs, beyond the Request-URI, to which the lock request
   applies.  The LockTree field is used to specify recursive locks.  If
   the LockTree field is "T", the lock request applies to the hierarchy
   traversal of the internal member resources of the Request-URI, and
   the AddLocks URIs, inclusive of the Request-URI and the AddLocks
   URIs.  It is not an error if LockTree is "T", and the Request-URI or
   the AddLocks URIs have no internal member resources.  By default,
   the value of LockTree is "F", and this field MAY be omitted when its
   value is "F".

<h3>9.10. Lock-Token Request Header</h3>

<PRE>   Lock-Token = "Lock-Token" ":" 1#Coded-URL
</PRE>

<P>The Lock-Token request header, containing a lock token owned by the
   requesting principal, is used by the principal to indicate that the
   principal is aware of the existence of the lock specified by the
   lock token.

<P>If the following conditions are met:

   1) The method is restricted by a lock type that requires the
   submission of a lock token, such as a write lock,
   2) The user-agent has authenticated itself as a principal,
   3) The user-agent is submitting a method request to a resource on
   which the principal owns a write lock,

<P>Then:

   1) The method request MUST include a <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header with the lock
      token, or,
   2) The method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.

<P>If multiple resources are involved with a method, such as a <TT>COPY</TT> or
   <TT>MOVE</TT> method, then the lock tokens, if any, for all involved
   resources, MUST be included in the Lock-Token request header.

<P>For example, Program A, used by user A, takes out a write lock on a
   resource.  Program A then makes a number of <TT>PUT</TT> requests on the
   locked resource.  All the requests contain a Lock-Token request
   header that includes the write lock state token.  Program B, also
   run by User A, then proceeds to perform a <TT>PUT</TT> to the locked
   resource.  However, program B was not aware of the existence of the
   lock and so does not include the appropriate Lock-Token request
   header.  The method is rejected even though principal A is
   authorized to perform the <TT>PUT</TT>.  Program B can, if it so chooses, now
   perform lock discovery and obtain the lock token.  Note that
   programs A and B can perform GETs without using the Lock-Token
   header because the ability to perform a <TT>GET</TT> is not affected by a
   write lock.

<P>Having a lock token provides no special access rights.  Anyone can
   find out anyone else's lock token by performing lock discovery.
   Locks are to be enforced based upon whatever authentication
   mechanism is used by the server, not based on the secrecy of the
   token values.

<h3>9.11. Lock-Token Response Header</h3>

<PRE>   Lock-Token = "Lock-Token" ":" Coded-URL
</PRE>

<P>If a resource is successfully locked then a <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header will
   be returned containing the lock token that represents the lock.

<h3>9.12. Overwrite Header</h3>

<PRE>   Overwrite = "Overwrite" ":" ("T" | "F")
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Overwrite</TT> header specifies whether the server should overwrite
   the state of a non-null destination resource during a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.
   A value of "F" states that the server MUST NOT perform the <TT>COPY</TT> or
   <TT>MOVE</TT> operation if the state of the destination resource is non-null.
   By default, the value of Overwrite is "T," and a client MAY omit
   this header from a request when its value is "T." While the
   <TT>Overwrite</TT> header appears to duplicate the functionality of the If-Match: * header of HTTP/1.1, If-Match applies only to the Request-URI, and not to the Destination of a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.

<P>If a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT> is not performed due to the value of the Overwrite
   header, the method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.

<h3>9.13. Propfind Request Header</h3>

<PRE>   Propfind = "Propfind" ":" ("allprop" | "propname" | RFC-Reg |
   1*(Property-Name))
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Propfind</TT> header is used to specify which properties are to be
   returned in a <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method.  The properties are identified by
   their URIs.  Two special tokens are defined for use with the
   <TT>Propfind</TT> header, allprop and propname.  The allprop token specifies
   that all property names and values on the resource are to be
   returned.  The propname token specifies that only a list of property
   names on the resource are to be returned.

<h3>9.14. Status-URI Response Header</h3>

<P>The Status-URI response header MAY be used with the 102 Processing
   response code to inform the client as to the status of a method.

<PRE>   Status-URI = "Status-URI" ":" *(Status-Code "&lt;" URI "&gt;") ; Status-
   Code is defined in 6.1.1 of [Fielding et al., 1997]
</PRE>

<P>The URIs listed in the header are source resources which have been
   affected by the outstanding method.  The status code indicates the
   resolution of the method on the identified resource.  So, for
   example, if a <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a collection is outstanding and a 102
   "Processing" response with a Status-URI response header is returned,
   the included URIs will indicate resources that have had move
   attempted on them and what the result was.

<h3>9.15. Timeout Header</h3>

<PRE>   TimeOut = "Timeout" ":" 1#TimeType
   TimeType = ("Second-" DAVTimeOutVal | "Infinite" | Other)
   DAVTimeOutVal = 1*digit
   Other = Extend field-value   ; See section 4.2 of RFC 2068
</PRE>

<P>Clients MAY include <TT>Timeout</TT> headers in their <TT>LOCK</TT> requests.
   However, the server is not required to honor or even consider these
   requests.  Clients MUST NOT submit a Timeout request header with any
   method other than a <TT>LOCK</TT> method.

<P>A Timeout request header MUST contain at least one TimeType and MAY
   contain multiple TimeType entries. The purpose of listing multiple
   TimeType entries is to indicate multiple different values and value
   types that are acceptable to the client.  The client lists the
   TimeType entries in order of preference.

<P>The Timeout response header MUST use a Second value, Infinite, or a
   TimeType the client has indicated familiarity with.  The server MAY
   assume a client is familiar with any TimeType submitted in a Timeout
   header.

<P>The "Second" TimeType specifies the number of seconds that MUST
   elapse between granting of the lock at the server, and the automatic
   removal of the lock.  A server MUST not generate a timeout value for
   "Second" greater than 2^32-1.

<P>The timeout counter is restarted any time an owner of the lock sends
   a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported methods,
   or methods which are unsuccessful.  It is recommended that the <TT>HEAD</TT>
   method be used when the goal is simply to restart the timeout
   counter.

<P>If the timeout expires then the lock is lost.  Specifically the
   server SHOULD act as if an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method was executed by the server
   on the resource using the lock token of the timed-out lock,
   performed with its override authority. Thus logs should be updated
   with the disposition of the lock, notifications should be sent,
   etc., just as they would be for an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> request.

<P>Servers are advised to pay close attention to the values submitted
   by clients, as they will be indicative of the type of activity the
   client intends to perform.  For example, an applet running in a
   browser may need to lock a resource, but because of the instability
   of the environment within which the applet is running, the applet
   may be turned off without warning.  As a result, the applet is
   likely to ask for a relatively small timeout value so that if the
   applet dies, the lock can be quickly harvested.  However, a document
   management system is likely to ask for an extremely long timeout
   because its user may be planning on going off-line.

<h2>10. Response Code Extensions to HTTP/1.1</h2>

<P>The following response codes are added to those defined in HTTP/1.1
   [Fielding et al., 1997].

<h3>10.1. 102 Processing</h3>

<P>Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process,
   especially methods that support the <TT>Depth</TT> header.  In such cases the
   client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response.  To
   prevent this the server MAY return a 102 response code to indicate
   to the client that the server is still processing the method.

<P>If a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but
   arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102
   "Processing" response.

<h3>10.2. 207 Multi-Status</h3>

<P>The response requires providing status for multiple independent
   operations.

<h3>10.3. 418 Unprocessable Entity</h3>

<P>The server understands the content type of the request entity, but
   was unable to process the contained instructions.

<h3>10.4. 419 Insufficient Space on Resource</h3>

<P>The resource does not have sufficient space to record the state of
   the resource after the execution of this method.

<h3>10.5. 420 Method Failure</h3>

<P>The method was not executed on a particular resource within its
   scope because some part of the method's execution failed causing the
   entire method to be aborted.  For example, if a resource could not
   be moved as part of a <TT>MOVE</TT> method, all the other resources would
   fail with a 420 Method Failure.

<h3>10.6. 421 Destination Locked</h3>

<P>The destination resource of a method is locked, and either the
   request did not contain a valid <TT>Lock-Info</TT> header, or the Lock-Info
   header identifies a lock held by another principal.


<h2>11. Multi-Status Response</h2>

<P>The default 207 Multi-Status response body is a text/xml HTTP entity
   that contains a single XML element called <TT> multistatus</TT>, which
   contains a set of XML elements called response, one for each 200,
   300, 400, and 500 series status code generated during the method
   invocation.  100 series status codes MUST NOT be recorded in a
   response XML element.

<h3>11.1. <TT> multistatus</TT> XML Element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>multistatus</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    Contains multiple response messages.
<BR>   Parent:     Any
<BR>   Value:      1*response [responsedescription]
<BR>   Description: The responsedescription at the top level is used to
   provide a general message describing the overarching nature of the
   response.  If this value is available an application MAY use it
   instead of presenting the individual response descriptions contained
   within the responses.

<h3>11.2. response XML Element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>response</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    Holds a single response
<BR>   Parent:     <TT> multistatus</TT>
<BR>   Value:      <TT>href</TT> [prop] status [responsedescription]
<BR>   Description: Prop MUST contain one or more empty XML elements
   representing the names of properties.  Multiple properties may be
   included if the same response applies to them all.  If <TT>href</TT> is used
   then the response refers to a problem with the referenced resource,
   not a property.

<h3>11.3. status XML Element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>status</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    Holds a single HTTP status-line
<BR>   Parent:     response
<BR>   Value:      status-line   ;status-line defined in [Fielding et al.,
   1997]

<h3>11.4. responsedescription XML Element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>responsedescription</TT>

<h2>12. Generic DAV XML Elements</h2>

<h3>12.1. <TT>href</TT> XML Element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>href</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To identify that the content of the element is a URI.
<BR>   Parent:     Any
<BR>   Value:      URI ; See section 3.2.1 of [Fielding et al., 1997]

<h3>12.2. link XML Element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>link</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To identify a property as a link and to contain the
   source and destination of that link.
<BR>   Values=     1*<TT>src</TT> 1*<TT>dst</TT>
<BR>   Description: Link is used to provide the sources and destinations of
   a link.  The type of the property containing the link XML element
   provides the type of the link.  Link is a multi-valued element, so
   multiple Links may be used together to indicate multiple links with
   the same type.


<h4>12.2.1. <TT>src</TT> XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT><TT>src</TT></TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To indicate the source of a link.
<BR>   Parent:     link
<BR>   Values=     URI


<h4>12.2.2. <TT>dst</TT> XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Purpose:    To indicate the destination of a link
<BR>   Parent:     link
<BR>   Values=     URI


<h4>12.2.3. Example</h4>

<PRE>   &lt;?XML version="1.0"&gt;
   &lt;?namespace href = "http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/" AS = "D"?&gt;
   &lt;?namespace href = "http://www.foocorp.com/Project/" AS = "F"?&gt;
   &lt;D:prop&gt;
     &lt;D:Source&gt;
          &lt;D:link&gt;
               &lt;F:projfiles&gt;Source&lt;/F:projfiles&gt;
               &lt;D:src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/D:src&gt;
               &lt;D:dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/main.c&lt;/D:dst&gt;
          &lt;/D:link&gt;
          &lt;D:link&gt;
               &lt;F:projfiles&gt;Library&lt;/F:projfiles&gt;
               &lt;D:src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/D:src&gt;
               &lt;D:dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/main.lib&lt;/D:dst&gt;
          &lt;/D:link&gt;
          &lt;D:link&gt;
               &lt;F:projfiles&gt;Makefile&lt;/F:projfiles&gt;
               &lt;D:src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/D:src&gt;
               &lt;D:dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/makefile&lt;/D:dst&gt;
          &lt;/D:link&gt;
     &lt;/D:Source&gt;
   &lt;/D:prop&gt;
</PRE>

<P>In this example the resource http://foo.bar/program has a <TT>source</TT>
   property that contains three links.  Each link contains three
   elements, two of which, <TT>src</TT> and <TT>dst</TT>, are part of the DAV schema
   defined in this document, and one which is defined by the schema
   http://www.foocorp.com/project/ (Source, Library, and Makefile).  A
   client which only implements the elements in the DAV spec will not
   understand the foocorp elements and will ignore them, thus seeing
   the expected source and destination links.  An enhanced client may
   know about the foocorp elements and be able to present the user with
   additional information about the links.  This example demonstrates
   the power of XML markup that allows for element values to be
   enhanced without breaking older clients.

<h3>12.3. prop XML element</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>prop</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    Contains properties related to a resource.
<BR>   Parent:     Any
<BR>   Values:     XML Elements
<BR>   Description: The prop XML element is a generic container for
   properties defined on resources.  All elements inside prop MUST
   define properties related to the resource.  No other elements may be
   used inside of a prop element.

<h3>13.14. <TT>resourcetype</TT> Property</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>resourcetype</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    This property contains a series of XML elements that
   specify information regarding the nature of the resource.  This
   specification only defines a single value, collection.
<BR>   Value:      XML elements
<BR>   Description:This property MUST be defined on all DAV compliant
   resources.  The default value is empty.

<h4>13.14.1. collection XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>collection</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    Identifies the associated resource as a collection.
   Collection resources MUST define this value with the <TT>resourcetype</TT>
   property.

   resource that contains the unprocessed source of the link's source.
<BR>   Parent:     None
<BR>   Value:      An XML document with zero or more link XML elements.
<br>   Discussion: The source of the link (<TT>src</TT>) is typically the URI of the
   output resource on which the link is defined, and there is typically
   only one destination (<TT>dst</TT>) of the link, which is the URI where the
   unprocessed source of the resource may be accessed.  When more than
   one link destination exists, this specification asserts no policy on
   ordering.

<h3>13.16. supportedlock Property</h3>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>supportedlock</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>   Purpose:    To provide a listing of the lock capabilities supported
   by the resource.
<BR>   Values:     An XML document containing zero or more LockEntry XML
   elements.
<BR>   Description:The supportedlock property of a resource returns a
   listing of the combinations of scope and access types which may be
   specified in a lock request on the resource.  Note that the actual
   contents are themselves controlled by access controls so a server is
   not required to provide information the client is not authorized to
   see.  If supportedlock is available on "*" then it MUST define the
   set of locks allowed on all resources on that server.

<h4>13.16.1. lockentry XML Element</h4>

<BR>   Name:       <TT>lockentry</TT>
<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/

<h2>14. DAV Compliance Levels</h2>

<P>A DAV compliant resource can choose from two levels of compliance.
   A client can discover which level a resource supports by executing
   <TT>OPTIONS</TT> on the resource, and examining the "DAV" header which is
   returned.

<P>Since this document describes extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol,
   minimally all DAV compliant resources, clients, and proxies MUST be
   compliant with RFC 2068 [Fielding et al., 1997].

<h3>14.1. Level 1</h3>

<P>A level 1 compliant resource MUST meet all "MUST" requirements in
   all sections of this document.

<h3>14.2. Level 2</h3>

<P>A level 2 compliant resource MUST meet all level 1 requirements and
   support the supportedlock property as well as the <TT>LOCK</TT> method.


<h2>15. Internationalization Considerations</h2>

<P>In the realm of internationalization issues, this specification is
   substantively in compliance with the IETF Character Set Policy
   [Alvestrand, 1997]. In this specification, human-readable fields can
   be found in either the value of a property, or in an error message
   returned in a response entity body.  In both cases, the human-readable content is encoded using XML, which has explicit provisions
   for character set tagging and encoding, and requires by default that
   XML processors read XML elements encoded using the UTF-8 and UCS-2
   encodings of the ISO 10646 basic multilingual plane.  Furthermore,
   XML contains provisions for encoding XML elements using other
   encoding schemes, notable among them UCS-4, which permits encoding
   of characters from any ISO 10646 character plane.

<P>The default character set encoding for XML data in this
   specification, and in general, is UTF-8.  WebDAV compliant
   applications MUST support the UTF-8 and UCS-2 character set
   encodings for XML elements, and SHOULD support the UCS-4 encoding.
   The XML character set encoding declaration for each supported
   character set MUST also be supported, since it is by using this
   encoding declaration that an XML processor determines the encoding
   of an element.

<P>XML also provides language tagging capability which provides the
   ability to specify the language of the contents of a particular XML
   element.  Although XML, and hence WebDAV, does not use RFC 1766
   language tags for its language names, the benefit of using standard
   XML in this context outweighs the advantage of using RFC 1766
   language tags.

<P>Names used within this specification fall into two categories: names
   specific to protocol elements such as methods and headers, names of
   XML elements, and names of properties.  Naming of protocol elements
   follows the precedent of HTTP, using English names encoded in
   USASCII for methods and headers.  Since these protocol elements are
   not visible to users, and are in fact simply long token identifiers,
   they do not need to support encoding in multiple character sets.
   Similarly, though the names of XML elements used in this
   specification are English names encoded in UTF-8, these names are
   not visible to the user, and hence do not need to support multiple
   character set encodings.

<P>The name of a property defined on a resource is a URI.  Although
   some applications (e.g., a generic property viewer) will display
   property URIs directly to their users, it is expected that the
   typical application will use a fixed set of properties, and will
   provide a mapping from the property name URI to a human-readable
   field when displaying the property name to a user.  It is only in
   the case where the set of properties is not known ahead of time that
   an application need display a property name URI to a user. We
   recommend that applications provide human-readable property names
   wherever feasible.

<P>For error reporting, we follow the convention of HTTP/1.1 status
   codes, including with each status code a short, English description
   of the code (e.g., 421 Destination Locked).  While the possibility
   exists that a poorly crafted user agent would display this message
   to a user, internationalized applications will ignore this message,
   and display an appropriate message in the user's language and
   character set.

<P>Since interoperation of clients and servers does not require locale
   information, this specification does not specify any mechanism for
   transmission of this information.


<h2>16. Security Considerations</h2>
   [TBD]


<h2>17. Terminology</h2>

<P>Collection - A resource that contains member resources.

<P>Member Resource - A resource contained by a collection.  There are
   two types of member resources: external and internal.

<P>Internal Member Resource - A member resource of a collection whose
   URI is relative to the URI of the collection.

<P>External Member Resource - A member resource of a collection with an
   absolute URI that is not relative to its parent's URI.

<P>Property - A name/value pair that contains descriptive information
   about a resource.

<P>Live Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are enforced
   by the server.  For example, a live "content-length" property would
   have its value, the length of the entity returned by a <TT>GET</TT> request,
   automatically calculated by the server.

<P>Dead Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are not
   enforced by the server.  The server only records the value of a dead
   property; the client is responsible for maintaining the consistency
   of the syntax and semantics of a dead property.
