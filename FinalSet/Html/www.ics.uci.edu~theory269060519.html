<h1>Conflict-Free Coloring of Shallow Discs</h1>

Abstract:
<p>
We prove that any collection of n discs in which each one intersects at 
most <I>k</I> others, can be colored with at most <I>O</I>(log<sup>3</sup><I>k</I>) colors so that for 
each point <I>p</I> in the union of all discs there is at least one disc in the 
collection containing <I>p</I> whose color differs from that of all other members
of the collection that contain <I>p</I>. This is motivated by a problem on 
frequency assignments in cellular networks, and improves the best 
previously known upper bound of <I>O</I>(log&nbsp;<I>n</I>) when <I>k</I> is much smaller than <I>n</I>.
