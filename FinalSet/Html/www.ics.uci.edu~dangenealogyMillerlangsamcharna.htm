Charna Langsam was my great-great grandmother.  She married my great-great
grandfather, Simon Rosenbach.  They both died in Przmysl, Poland.  Charna
died in 1939.  Unfortunately, that is the extent  of my knowledge of 
her.  I
look forward to hearing how we are related and any more information you 
have
about her or her siblings.

Thanks,

Rama Dunayevich

Czarna Langsam and Simon Rosenbach had a daughter Pearl (Pepy), born in Krakowitz in 1880.
Pearl married Herrish Messner (POW in WW I) and had three kids in Przemysl:
* Osias - a watchmaker, (1903 - 1981); had 1s & 1d; came to USA in 1920
* Nathan (Nisen)- born 1908; deceased, came to USA in 1923
* Edna (Rifka) - born 1910, came to USA in 1923. Living in Monsey today ( I will try to call), 
Her oldest son is Elisha, also in Monsey

From the ship manifests I viewed, there was another child to Czarna and Simon:
Nissen, born 1886. He lived in NYC on 33 Willet St and was married. He was naturalized in 
Supreme Court of NYC on Jan 15? Jan 28? May 14?, 1915 in NY. He travelled on Oct 28, 1921, 
Feb 25, 1922, May 19, 1922, Nov 17, 1922, Mar 31, 1923, Aug 24, 1923, June 24, 1924

Thanks, but what of your own lineage. Is Nathan your grandfather? Does he 
have surviving children? which of his children is your parent?

Sorry, I thought I had already given you that information.

Nathan is my grandfather.  He had two daughters, my aunt Michele Kaufman of 
Las Vegas and my mother Hattie of New York.  I have already pumped them for 
information and they do not know anymore than I do, in fact, unfortunately, 
less.

Thanks,
Rama
