<P>

I maintain a program called DAV Explorer. This is a WebDAV client
program that came out of an ICS125 project a couple of years back and
was significantly changed afterwards. The problem with the program is
that it uses a very old XML parser, which doesn't support all the
features that are needed nowadays. The idea is to replace the old
parser with a new, DOM-compliant one.  This is not easy, since the
parser code is used throughout the program. So it would be a
reengineering effort.
