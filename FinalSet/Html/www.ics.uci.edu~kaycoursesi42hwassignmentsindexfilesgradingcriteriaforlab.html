<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Lab assignments will be graded on the following
qualities, in rough order of priority:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Correctness</B> (Nothing else matters if
the results aren&#39;t right.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Completeness</B> (We expect everyone to
finish the required features of each assignment, but if it comes to a choice,
it&#39;s much better, both in class and in real life, to submit something
that works perfectly but doesn&#39;t implement every feature than something
that could produce a wrong answer.)</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Design</B> (Correctness matters, but it&#39;s
not the only thing that matters.  Your design choices should not be awkward,
cumbersome, or inappropriate; your methods should be broken into parts rather
than getting too long.  In early assignments, though, we will specify most
of the design for you.)</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Style</B> (Your program should be appropriately
formatted, your class, method, field, and constant names should be meaningful,
and in general you should follow the conventions described at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">.
 We use the term &quot;style&quot; here in the sense of &quot;good style&quot;
and &quot;bad style,&quot; not in the sense of Hemingway&#39;s style being
different from Joyce&#39;s.  Everybody&#39;s code should adhere both to
the generally accepted rules of good programming style and to the specific
style guidelines of their organization.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Documentation</B> (Every class and every
method should include a docstring (a string as the first line of the definition) that provides brief but pithy description of their meaning and
behavior, along the lines of the purpose statements we wrote in Scheme.
 You&#39;ll note that the Scheme contracts are now part of the actual code
as annotations in the function header.)</FONT><BR CLEAR=ALL>
