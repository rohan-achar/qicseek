Hi,

Thanks for your inquiry. Based on your note, we are definitely family. I would be 
interested in exploring your exact connection with Pesach Langsam, father of the 
Bnei Yissochur. 

You may find our website
www.langsam.com
of interest. 

Please elaborate on your ancestry.

Hi,
Thanks for your response. Based on your data, I am having difficulty 
connecting you. Since you know you connect to the Bnei Yissochur, we 
must be related. Have you had a chance to review the website at
www.langsam.com
or the specific pages on the Langsam family at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/homelang.htm

Can you provide some more detail. 
When did Rachel, your great grand mother live (how old was she? when 
did she pass away?  when was she born)? Where did she live? 

What was Rachel, your great grand mother's married name (family name)?
Did Meir and Ita Faiga have other children?
Where did they live?

Can you tell me YOUR name?

Hi,

I have a relative, Jacob LANGSAM, who has his final resting place in Sinai 
Cemetery (March 20, 1949).  Do you know what information the cemetery might 
have on hand? I called them but they asked that I write a letter requesting 
the information I want. I want whatever they have. I also checked the web and 
found a website that will send certified death records for $10, but without 
supplying ALL the information (on VS-112), it can take much longer than the 
minimum 3 MONTHS!

Any recommendations or insight would be welcome and appreciated. 

Perhaps you might be interested in a barter arrangement? I work next to a vital 
records building in NY city:

Yes I know of Rose Langsam.  I believe she lived or lives in San Rafael.   
Saul Langsam or Norm with whom you spoke the other week will know more about 
her.  I remember meeting her but I was young and she seemed very old to me.   
I am sorry I did not have a chance to return your call the other day.  I had 
returned from vacation and cannot seem to catch up on all my work.  Saul 
should knwo more about her because of the age difference among us.  I am 
going to be 50 this year and Saul is in his mid seventies.  Also Rose lived 
pretty close to where Saul used to live.  I remember my father speaking of 
Rose Langsam as a cousin.

Hi Moishe,


Sol is someway related to Sylvia.  Interesting that you ask how.  I was 
trying to find that out earlier this year.  I spoke to my aunt (Morris' 
daughter) and she could not tell me.  Everyone thought a different story.  No 
one can remember a husband or a father of Sol.  I will try to contact him and 
get permission to send you family information or give you his address.  


The relatives that I know of were Jack Langsam - Never Married; Sam Langsam, 
Irving Langsam - Married w/one son - sons whereabouts unknown, Sylvia 
Langsam, Sol Langsam, the "two Rosies" -.  All of these people are dead now 
except for Sol.
They all lived in the San Francisco and general Bay Area in Ca.


Then of course there is my immediate family Fred, Lee (Sweder) Langsam and 
their children:  Robert & wife      Marsha & 1st husband Allan
                            their children
                        Justin & wife Brandie
                            their two sons

Hi, 

I am an amateur genealogist researching my family history. Pesach 
Langsam (1748 - 1820) had several children, the oldest one never 
having adopted the surname LANGSAM (but rather Miller, from whom I 
descend). 

Would you perhaps be interested in exploring a possible connection 
to the original Pesach Langsam? I have a website with a fair amount 
of detail on his descendents. It is at 
www.langsam.com

I think your specific branch can be found at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/isrel-h4.htm

I look forward to your response.

Dear Moist:

Thank you so much for the information about my family tree.

There were a few mistakes:

My father, Mark Langsam had 8 brothers and sisters.  I only know the name of 
the youngest brother, Mendel Langsam.  All of this brothers and sisters died 
in the holocaust except for Mendel who went to Palestine in 1938 and died in 
Israel in 1983.

My father, Mark, married my mother, Ida in 1944 in Vienna, Austria and came 
to the U.S. in 1947.  

My mother, Ida died in 1983 but was buried in San Francisco, not in Israel.

My father died in 1986 and was buried in Los Angeles.

If you have any more information about my family tree I would greatly 
appreciate it.


Best regards,

Charley Langsam

Hi,

Thanks so much for your response. I do have some more data on your 
family. Firstly, via Mayer's death records, we found that his father 
(your great-grandfather) was named Israel. Also, I still have some 
loose ends. There is a Henderson connection that I have not been 
able to pin down. Some descendents own a restaurant of sorts in 
California. 

I would like to follow up more on your branch. Do you know more 
about your father's first family that perished? Any names or old 
pictures? Do you know any detail on your own grandfather? Did your 
uncle Mendel have any children? If so, do you have the name or 
address of a person I can contact in their tree to try and fill in 
some more? 

Do you know any more about Chaim's siblings or other Langsam's that 
you know are related to you, even if you do not know how? Any detail 
on Israel, Chaim's father?

Thanks so much for your response and time,

Dear Moishe--


Thank you so much for the family tree information.


As to your questions:


I am born in San Francisco in 1949.


I think that the Hendersons are spelled Henersons.  There are two relatives, 
Stanley and James who live in California.  Their parents were Morris and 
Gladys Henerson.  Morris died several years ago.  I don't know about Gladys.
My uncle, Mendel had no children and was never married.


Also my father, Mark Langsam had 2 daughters who died in the holocaust but 
they were born before 1942.


My mother, Ida Langsam's maiden name was Goldwater.  Her first husband's last 
name was Diller.  He also died in the holocaust.


I don't have much more information but would greatly appreciate more 
information about the Langsam family tree.


Best regards,

Charley Langsam

Also, Marti Ann Schwartz, a cousin of yours, asked that if I ever

Dear Moishe


I would very much like to know the connection with my grandfather and Gladys 
Henerson (She was married to Morris Henerson and is the Langsam cousin.)


It is ok for you to give my e-mail address to Marti Schwartz.  She can  get 
in touch with you.  


Thank you for all your work and information about the Langsam family tree.


Stay well and  best regards,

Hi,

I am trying to find out more about the common ancestry I share with 
a distant cousin of mine, who has passed on. Her name was GLADYS 
HENERSON  and she passed away on Mar 28, 2000 (she was almost 95 
years old). She was from Oakland/Alameda. I believe that one of her 
parents was a Langsam. 

Is there anybody that might know of her ancestry? I figure that the 
temple might have her parents/grandparents names if she ever needed 
it for yizkor. 

Please let me know if you can be of ANY help, or recommend some 
other avenue.

Dear Moishe,


I looked at the Oakland area telephone book and there are no 
HENERSONs listed. I then tried the San Francisco book and there is 
just one listed. An Allen HENERSON of 34 6th Street, San Francisco, 
CA. The telephone number is (415) 503-0718. Naturally I don't know 
if there is a connection.


Were the HENERSONs Jewish? There are two Jewish cemeteries in 
Oakland, one is part of the Mountain View Cemetery in Piedmont 
Avenue, the other is the Home of Peace Cemetery in the south part of 
Oakland.


I am racking my brain to hink if there is any NY trade you can do 
for me. I have family who came over from London (I am English) and I 
also have some genealogy clients who have NYC connections. Let  me 
think about this.


Do you want to call this guy in SF? It might sound better coming from 
you rather than through me as an intermediary.


Let me know.

Hello, Moishe

It's nice to hear from you. This inquiry is especially interesting to me as I 
remember Gladys Henerson vaguely from Temple Sinai in Oakland. I really
didn't know her, but her husband, Morris, was my religious school teacher
one year. You mentioned a son Stan. I remember their older son, James.

Morrie Henerson was also the executive director of Temple Sinai, so I just
phoned the Temple office. They connected me to the cemetery. Gladys is
buried at Home of Eternity, 500 Piedmont Avenue, Oakland 94611.
The woman I spoke with (Rhonda) said they do not have any info on
Glady's parents.  And since Temple Sinai is reform, I have a feeling
that there may not be any Hebrew on the gravestone.
I told the woman that I had known the family, and she said that she did, too.
I said I remembered their son, Jimmy. She said, "We're in touch in with
Jimmy." I said I went on the web and got 2 southern Calif. addresses for
James Henerson. She said, "Oh, from the film website?" I said no, from
telephone listings. She said she couldn't reveal the address. I said which
one do you like best , Santa Barbara or Sherman Oaks? She said,"Sherman
Oaks."  So here is Jimmy's address and Phone:

James Henerson
15300 Kingswood Lane
Sherman Oaks, CA 91403

Phone # 818-981-5893

I did a web search, and James is apparently a writer for some TV shows
and various films.

If you phone him, you can mention my name (and my brother Don Rubin)
if you wish, though I don't think he would remember me. I think he's about
4 years younger than I am. I'm 68. Maybe it's best not to mention that 
Rhonda told me which town. Just say I remembered the name James,
and that I (or you) did a web search for Calif. James Henersons.

I'll find out the address to get the death certificate.

I'll really be interested to know if I was sitting in synagogue with an einicle
of Rebbe Elimelech! Even as a young child, I felt the connection with the ages.

For maybe a year, Irwin Spira was director of the religious school. At the
time I had no knowledge of the significance of the name Spira. I've not seen
his name since.

To be continued.

Marian

Hi,

Thanks very much for your reply. What I have learned in the meantime 
is that Gladys' husband, Morrie Henerson, was the executive director 
of Temple Sinai. His ancestry is outside the scope of my research. 
Gladys was Jewish and is layed to rest at Home of Eternity, in 
Oakland. I think one of her sons was in TV and film (Jimmy) in 
Sherman Oaks. 

I will try calling Allen, I agree with your assessment.

Hi Moishe,


I happen to have on my shelf the 100th anniversary volume published 
for the Temple Sinai in 1975 and they are listed in there and Morris 
was Executive Director at the time. SO he must have passed away 
after then. I also know the cemetery very well as I have done some 
research for an Australian client who also has a distant relative 
buried there.


I can photograph the grave and send you the picture as an email

Dear Mr. Miller, 

I just finished glancing at the Langsam web-site, and I'm 
overwhelmed.  I never had much interest in my family's geneology, 
but I find as I grow older - I'm 66 - my interest has grown.  To the 
best of my knowledge, our connection to the Langsams is through my 
maternal grandmother, Fanny, who bore that maiden name.   I think 
she had three brothers, David, Sam and Jack, all of whom have long 
since passed on.  Dave had off-spring, but Sam and Jack died 
bachelors.  I knew Mark Langsam and his second wife, and if memory 
serves, my mother considered him her first cousin.  For that to be 
true, however, Mark would have had to be the brother of the 
aforementioned David, Sam and Jack - and I don't think that was the 
case.   

Anyway, I would be happy to help you in any way I can, but I have 
the feeling that what I just wrote amounts to the sum total of my 
knowledge.   

Best regards,] 

Jim Henerson

Thanks for your reply and words of interest. It is possible that

Where/when did Fanny live and what was her married name? How many 
children did she have?

What can you tell me about Dave Langsam? What about Sam or Jack?

Fanny's married name was Kornhauser.  She came from a village in 
Galicia near Krakov, but I can't come up with the name.  When I 
was born, she lived on Sedgwick Avenue and West 197the Street in 
the Bronx.  She had five children, Dave - two children, Bobby & 
Jerry,  Ruth, married name Katz, two children, Jerry and  (?), 
Dottie, no children, Gladys, my mother, two children Jim and Stan, 
and Anna, married name Fisk, one daughter, Marilyn. 

Can't tell you much about Dave, Sam or Jack.  Dave ran a real estate 
business in Sausalito, California where my dad worked for a short 
time in 1944.  I'm not sure what Sam did, but he might have been 
partners with Jack in Jack's Furniture, a retail business on Mission 
Street in San Francisco.   

Sorry I can't come up with more.  Let me know if you turn up 
something interesting about the aforementioned. 

Best,

Dear Moishe,

I am looking at a snail mail letter you sent me, dated October 24, 
2002.  If memory serves - and it may not - I replied with what 
meager information I had.  Today, having found your letter in a pile 
of unfiled material, I visited the H4/H18 website and, sure enough, 
discovered a number of relatives.  The one I didn't find was my 
maternal grandmother, Fanny Kornhauser, nee Langsam.  According to 
the page, one of Mayer's progeny was one Miram who married a David 
Kornhausr, but she is listed as having perished in the Holocaust 
which Fanny survived.  

My mother spoke of Sam, Dave , Jack and Mark Langsam as her first 
cousins, but neither could I find Fanny among the progeny of Chaim 
or Yakov.  

Can you throw some light on the subject?  Alternatively, could you 
give my E-Mail address and/or phone number to Anna Solomon or, third 
option, give me hers? 
My E-Mail address is Henerson@aol.com.  My phone number is (818) 981

Hope you are well and filling in the blanks.

Since my mother always referred to Dave, Sam and Jack as first

that would have made them uncles to my mom.   The situation is 
clearer with regard to Mark, whom my mother also called a first 
cousin.  With Mark, at least, we have in Chaim the requisite father. 

Sorry for the confusion.

Dear Mr. Miller, 

I came across your address and website while trying to research my 
family tree. My name is Michelle Neiman and I live in Akron, Ohio. I 
have been desperately seeking information concerning my grandmother 
whose maiden name was Langsam.

My grandmother's name was Anna Langsam who married William Neiman 
(Wolf Neumann). She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman and died 
three weeks later at approximately age 24 in 1926. I have been 
unable to find any information concerning her, as anybody who could 
have given me information has since passed. I have never even been 
able to locate her grave which is somewhere in Pittsburg.

The only information I have is that the family lived in the 
Pittsburg area and moved to San Francisco after a flood devastated 
their (furniture) business-probably the St. Patrick's Day Flood of 
1936. Anna's brothers were Paul, Philip and Sam. She also had a 
sister named Rose. I don't have any additional information, so I 
don't know if I fit somewhere into the descendants of Pesach, or 
not. 

I would be grateful for any information you have concerning my 
grandmother or any of her siblings. I have checked many websites 
including ancestry.com and familysearch.org but I haven't gotten any 
good leads. Thank you for your time.

Hi,

Tonight begins the Jewish fast of "Tisha B'Av" (the ninth
day of Av), which marks the destruction of both Temples in
Jewish History. I will be home tomorrow afternoon and you
can try me in NY at 718-258-5512 after 4pm. 

In the interim, let me try to outline some of your family.
Your grandmother (whose Hebrew name was Charna) came here
on August 14, 1912 via the port of Antwerp together with
her brother Philip (Hebrew name Pinchus) and sister Rose
(Hebrew name Chula). She was nine years old. You can view
the ship manifests for her arrival (2 pages) at:

I have an outline of the rest of her family at:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/isrel-h4.htm

I guess that the people supplying me with the information
have lost track of your grandmother's existence. If you
like, I can put you in touch with your cousin Rose in San
Francisco. 

Please share any more detail on your own genealogy with me.
Who did your father, Harold Neiman, marry? How many
children were there (including you)? Can you provide any
more detail on your own family?

We were able to get her death certificate because she actually died 
here in Akron. The only information the death certificate provided 
was that her body was returned to Pittsburgh by hearse. I found that 
unusual since most travel was by train back then. No one in the 
family seems to know where she could be buried. It is no small task 
since there are about 400 jewish burial areas in the Pittsburgh 
area. I have looked 3-4 times to narrow the search. Some are 
actually just a few headstones in between houses. I will keep 
looking. I may also try to find her marriage record since that might 
indicate the congregation she belonged to, which might help narrow 
my search.

Once again, I want to thank you for the information. I really can't
express what it means. I am named after my grandmother-my middle 
name is Langsam-so I have searched a long, long time to find out 
something about my family. You have handed me the missing pieces!

Anna Langsam married William Neiman aka Wolf Neumann. They lived in
Akron, Ohio. She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman on July 1, 
1926 and died 22 days later on July 23, 1926. She was buried in 
Pittsburg somewhere supposedly with her mother, and an aunt. ( I 
have never been able to locate the graves but I have renewed hope 
now.) My grandfather remarried (third wife actually, Anna was the 
second wife!) The new wife was also called Anna. Together they had 
four more children-my father's half-siblings. 

My father Harold Neiman married Hazel "Casey" Kline. I am one of 
three daughters: Karyn Lynne Neiman born 1963, Lori Ann Neiman born 
1965, died 1988. I am Michelle Langsam Neiman born 1967.

My sister also lives in Akron and is married to John Goldsmith. They 
have two daughters-Allison and Victoria. 

I barely remember both my older and younger "aunt" roses who used to 
visit us in Akron, Ohio. We also visited them in San Francisco at 
the apartment building on Funston Street. It is good to hear that 
the younger Rose is still living but it is my understanding that she 
does not want to hear from my part of the family and has been 
reluctant to share family history in the past, so I don't think I 
will travel down that road.

I am very excited to continue my family research. You have opened 
many doors! I will try to call you one evening this week to speak in 
person, and that will give you a day or two to update the family 
information. I am eternally grateful. Thanks again. Take care.

Dear Mr. Miller:
 
Thank you for your recent e-mail message in which you asked about
our holdings regarding naturalization.  The Mid-Atlantic Region is
the repository for federal documents considered permanently 
valuable.  Federal agencies and U.S. Courts in the states of 
Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia have 
created the records that we hold.  

The National Archives is the repository of naturalization records 
for the Federal District and Circuit Courts.  The indexes for the
Federal Courts in the Western District of PA were searched for the
years 1906-1926.   Jakob Langsom was found.  To receive copies of
the naturalization papers, provide us with your postal mailing
address.  Please send a check or money order for $10.00 made out to
NATFB and mail to our address listed below.  Once we receive
payment we will forward the copies.

Before September 22, 1922, females of any age and males under age 18
were naturalized under their husband's or father's petition.
