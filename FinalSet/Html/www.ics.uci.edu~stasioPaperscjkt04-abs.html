<P>ABSTRACT:
</P>
<P>
The source of&nbsp;multicast communication needs to securely verify which 
multicast group members have received a multicast message, 
but&nbsp;verification of individually signed acknowledgments from each 
receiver&nbsp;imposes&nbsp;unnecessary computation and communication 
costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a solution&nbsp;which allows the intermediate 
nodes along the multicast distribution tree to aggregate&nbsp;the authenticated 
acknowledgments sent by the multicast receivers&nbsp;to the source.&nbsp;
<P>Our solution&nbsp;consists of a new multisignature scheme, secure under the 
	discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model, which blends the 
	well-known Schnorr signature scheme with the Merkle hash tree structure. The 
	multisignature scheme we propose has a novel property of <EM>robustness, </EM>which 
	allows for an efficient&nbsp;multisignature generation even in the presence 
	of&nbsp;maliciously faulty nodes.
