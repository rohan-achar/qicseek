Title: 
On Embedding a Graph in the Grid with the Maximum Number of Bends and
Other Bad Features
</h2>

<p>
Abstract: 
Graph Drawing is (usually) concerned with the production of readable
representations of graphs. In this paper, instead of investigating
how to produce "good" drawings, we tackle the opposite
problem of producing "bad" drawings. In particular, we study
how to construct orthogonal drawings with many bends along the edges
and with large area. Our results show surprising contact points, in
Graph Drawing, between the computational cost of niceness and the one
of ugliness.
