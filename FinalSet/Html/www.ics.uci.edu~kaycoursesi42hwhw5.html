<P><strong>Part I</strong></P>
<P>Your local radio station wants to computerize its collection of CDs. They have asked you consider these three alternative data structures:
<ol type=I>
<li>A conventional linked list, in no particular order</li>
<li>An array ordered by CD title, with an additional field that stores the number of CDs in the collection</li>
<li>A binary search tree, ordered by CD title.</li></ol>
<p>When we ask for O-notations below, give the closest-fit O-notation in terms of n, the number of CDs n the collection, assuming each operation is coded as efficiently as possible in Java.</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Suppose the first task is to add all the CD data into the new system. Which of the three data structures would be most efficient for this task alone? As part of your answer, give each alternative's O-notation for adding a CD to the collection. 
<!--Some will read this as asking about one addition instead of all; that's okay if their answers are consistent. List is O(n); array is O(n log n)—create array, add items, sort—but give credit if they say n^2 for adding them in linearly; tree is O(n log n). List wins.<br>
  1 point for each, plus 1 point for conclusion.-->  </p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> A DJ spends most of his or her time looking up CDs by title. What is each data structure's O-notation for locating a CD by title? Which data structure do you most want to avoid for this task?<br>
<!--  Searching list is O(n); searching array is O(log n) using binary search; searching the tree is O(log n); avoid List.

  1 point for each, plus 1 point for conclusion (that follows from O-notation)--></p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> The station manager wants to know at any given moment exactly how many CDs are in the collection. Give each alternative's O-notation for determining the number of CDs and say which alternative is most efficient for this operation. Don't assume the existence of any data fields not specified above.
  <!--
  List is O(n) because there's no size field; array is O(1) 'cause it has size; BST is O(n). Array wins.<br>
  1 point for each, plus 1 point for conclusion
  --></P>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> What would be the best data structure to use for implementing this collection, and (in one brief sentence including O-notations where appropriate) why? Assume that task (a) will be done just once and that most of the collection's usage will be split evenly between tasks (b) and (c). You may propose small modifications to the data structures described above if they would help produce a clear winner.
  <!--
  1/2 point for conclusion, 1/2 point for reasoning.<br>
A variety of answers is possible, depending on how they modify the collection. What I was thinking of was adding a size field to each, which would make the array and the tree equivalent by O-notation on the two critical operations. It's okay if they just say they're tied; it's also okay if they break the tie either (a) by saying the tree is better for the one-time task of filling the collection or (b) by saying the array is better because it requires less storage per CD or (c) by saying the tree is better because it dynamically allocates just enough storage for the current size of the collection. Basically, they get the points if what they say is consistent and correct, and they don't if it's not.--></P>
<p><strong>Part II</strong></P>
<p><B>(a)</B> As we did in class on Thursday afternoon, draw the state transition diagram (STD) for a finite-state automaton (FSA) that accepts the language of dollars-and-cents amounts with comas in the right places. Accepted strings include:</P>
<pre><code>$1.00     $1,234.56      $1,234,567.89       $1,234,567,890.00
$13.27    $12,345.00     $12,345,678.90      $0.00
$125.50   $123,456.78    $123,456,789.00     $0.25</code></pre>
<p>Rejected strings include:</P>
<pre><code>$1        $5.000         $123,45.00          $1,234,00      $00.00
$25       $17.5          $1,234,5.67         $1,234,.00     $03.50
$234.     $1234.56       $1234,567.00        $,123,456.00   $0,123.45</code></pre>

<p><strong>(b) </strong>Below is some Python code that implements
  a kind of finite-state automaton.</P>
<PRE><code>SECRET1 = 35
SECRET2 = 127
SECRET3 = 33

stateList = [ "Init", "GotFirst", "GotSecond", "Success" ]

count = 1

state = "Init"

while state != "Success" and count <= 3:
    number = get_next()

    if state == "Init":
        if number == SECRET1:
            state = "GotFirst"
        else:
            state = "Init"
    elif state == "GotFirst":
        if number == SECRET2:
            state = "GotSecond"
        else:
            state = "Init"
    elif state == "GotSecond":
        if number == SECRET3:
            state = "Success"
        else:
            state = Init
    count += 1
    
if state == "Success": 
    print("Input accepted.")
else:
    print("Input rejected.")
</code></PRE>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(b.1)</B>  Draw the state transition diagram
that represents the FSA this program implements.  The input tokens here
are whole integers, not individual characters.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(b.2)</B>  Describe in one brief English
sentence what this FSA does.  Try to think of a simple, real-world, non-computer-related
object that this FSA models.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Intermezzo:</B>  State transition diagrams
are one way to describe FSAs.  Another way (which is easier to represent
in a computer) is a <B>transition table.</B>  A transition table has a row
for each state and a column for each input (or each disjoint category of
inputs); the value at each position in the table tells you what state to
go to when you read a given input in a given state.  Below is a transition
table for the program above:</FONT>

</TABLE>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">This table says just what the program and the
state transition diagram say:  If you&#39;re in Init and you read Secret1,
you go into state GotFirst; if you&#39;re in state Init and you read anything
else, you stay in Init.  If you&#39;re in state GotFirst and you read Secret2,
you go into state GotSecond; if you read anything else in state GotFirst
you go to state Init.  And finally, if you&#39;re in state GotSecond and
you read Secret3, you go to state Success; otherwise, you go to Init.  In
state Success the machine stops, so you don&#39;t make any transitions out
of that state; it&#39;s the accept state.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">As we noted, transition tables make FSAs easy
to represent in a computer.  In fact, we can write a very simple but very
general FSA simulator according to the following pseudocode:</FONT></P>

<PRE><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">initialize TransitionTable, ListOfAcceptStates 
state &larr; initial state

while there are more tokens:
    get a token;
    state &larr; TransitionTable[state][token];

if state in ListOfAcceptStates:
    accept
else:
    reject</font></PRE>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Because this code is so simple, it&#39;s the
preferred way to implement FSAs in programs.  The only tricky part is finding
a data type that will represent the range of tokens and will at the same
time be acceptable as an array index in your programming language.  Scheme,
for example, handles symbolic names very easily, and so does Python, allowing any string to be an index into a dictionary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(c)</B>  Think about the task of extracting
words from a stream of text.  In Python, you can use split() to divide lines around whitespace (or other separators), but sometimes you need to specify &quot;words&quot; idiosyncratically.
 You can do this kind of input-parsing task much more easily using state
machines than by writing code directly.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(c.1)</B>  Draw a state transition diagram
that accepts words defined as follows:  a sequence of non-separator characters
whose end is marked by a separator.  Separators are symbols that separate
English words&mdash;space, comma, semicolon, colon, and so on.  Note that the
hyphen (-), the apostrophe (&#39;), and the percent sign (%) are not separators:
 treat &quot;mother-in-law,&quot; &quot;don&#39;t,&quot; and &quot;23%&quot;
as single words.   The end of the line is a separator, unless the last word
of the line ends with a hyphen.  That way, if a word like mother-in-law
is hyphenated across two lines, it will still count as one word.  (We will
assume that in our input, only words that are always hyphenated will be
hyphenated at the end of a line; that is, you should not expect normally-unhyphenated
words to be broken across two lines.)  Watch for multiple separators in
a row&mdash;for example, a comma followed by a space is two separators, but there
is no word between them.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">You could code up this FSA into a method called
getNextWord, and call it to parse a stream of input.
 Coding this isn&#39;t a required part of this assignment, though.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(c.2)</B>  Write a transition table for
the state machine you drew in part <B>(c.1)</B>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(d)</B> One of Scheme&#39;s attractions
is that its syntax is very simple.  Unlike Python, which has quite a few different
statements, each with its own grammar and punctuation rules, every program
or expression in Scheme is just a list of words surrounded by parentheses.
 This provides a rich variety of expression because a &quot;word&quot; can
be (a) any sequence of characters delimited (separated from other words)
by white space, or (b) a parenthesized list of words nested within the outside
list.  The following are all valid Scheme expressions (each is one line
long except the last, which starts with the word</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>define</FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">):<A NAME="_14_6726"></A></FONT></P>

(+ 3.14159 1776 -45 quantity)
(equal? (+ 2 2) (+ 3 1))
(define square
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x)))</font></PRE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Novice Scheme programmers sometimes worry about
keeping all the parentheses balanced, but most Scheme systems have &quot;syntax-based&quot;
text editors that automatically keep track of the parentheses, so that any
time you type a right parenthesis it automatically flashes the left parenthesis
that matches it.  That way you can see effortlessly what matches what. 
(This idea has found its way into some program editors for Python and other
languages, where it&#39;s also useful.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Suppose you decide to write a syntax-based
editor for Scheme, and as your first task you want to write some code that
checks whether the parentheses are balanced in a Scheme expression.  Astutely,
you start by designing an FSA.  To make it truly a <I>finite-</I>state machine,
we have to put an upper limit on the depth to which parentheses can be nested;
the example below shows the FSA for an upper limit of three-deep nesting.
(In the diagram, &quot;other&quot; means an input symbol other than an open
or close parenthesis.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Fifth_Homework_files/Picture_299.gif" WIDTH=429 HEIGHT=144 ALT=""></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(d.1) </B>After scanning the entire Scheme
expression, in what state should your machine be if the parentheses were
correctly balanced?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(d.2) </B>This FSA works fine in theory,
but for a realistic nesting depth of a few dozen, the diagram would be tediously
repetitious.  So you decide to simplify things and encapsulate the state
information in a simple integer counter.  Then you can have a single state
on the page, and all the action happens in the transition steps, where you
increment the counter for each left parenthesis and decrement it for each
right parenthesis.  [Having a variable may appear to violate the definition
of a finite-state machine, all of whose information is encapsulated in a
finite number of states.  But since integer variables on computers (as opposed
to integers in mathematics) always have a finite upper bound, we&#39;re
technically safe.  If our machine used a stack to keep track of the unbalanced
parentheses (which is what our integer counter is modeling), it would no
longer be an FSA&mdash;it would be a PDA (push-down automaton), which can accept
a broader class of languages.]  </FONT></P>

</CENTER>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">In the augmented machine, being in the stop
state is not enough to know that the Scheme program has balanced parentheses;
the value of the counter must be considered as well. What should the counter&#39;s
value be if the machine accepts the Scheme source (that is, if the parentheses
are correctly balanced)? What must have happened for the machine to end
up in the error state?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(d.3) </B> Things are rarely quite as simple
as they first seem.  Comments in Scheme programs start with a semicolon
and extend to the end of the line.  Thus, the following is a valid Scheme
expression; everything to the right of the semicolon on each line is a comment.
 Of course the contents of comments are ignored when checking for balanced
parentheses.</FONT></P>
<PRE><code>  (define print-it        ; In this routine we
    (lambda (p)           ; a) accept a parameter,
      (display p)         ; b) display it, and
      (newline)))         ; c) hit carriage return</code></PRE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Draw a new FSA-like machine, similar to the
one above, to account for comments correctly; you will have to add more
states.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(d.4)</B>  And there&#39;s one more wrinkle.
 Literal character strings in Scheme are enclosed in double-quote marks.
 As in any programming language, the contents of literal strings are ignored when analyzing
the syntax of the program.  The following three expressions are valid in
Scheme.</FONT></P>
<pre><code>(display &quot;Oh; really?&quot;)
