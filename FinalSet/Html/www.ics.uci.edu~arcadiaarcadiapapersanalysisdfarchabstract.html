"<b>A Flexible Architecture for Building Data Flow Analyzers</b>"</A>,
by Matthew B. Dwyer and Lori A. Clarke in Technical Report 94-082,
Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

Data flow analysis is a versatile technique that can be used to address 
a variety of analysis problems. Typically, data flow analyzers are 
handcrafted to solve a particular analysis problem. In this paper, we 
describe an architecture for data flow analyzers along with a library of 
components and component generators that can be employed to build data 
flow analyzers. We further extend the architecture to support the development 
of analyzers for qualified data flow analysis problems. We describe our 
experience using this architecture to construct several prototype data 
flow analyzers.
