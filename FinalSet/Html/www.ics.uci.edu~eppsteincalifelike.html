    <h1><span>Lifelike Rules and Pattern Notation</span></h1>

    <p><span>Conway's Game of Life is defined as follows: each cell
    of a two-dimensional grid is considered to be either "live" or
    "dead". At each step of the automaton's evolution, each cell
    counts the number of its live neighbors in the eight
    surrounding cells of the grid. A dead cell becomes live (is
    "born") if it has exactly three live neighbors, and a live cell
    stays live ("survives") if it has either two or three live
    neighbors; in all other cases the cell becomes dead. This
    process is performed simultaneously for all cells of the grid,
    forming a single "generation" of a life pattern. Over the
    course of many generations, a pattern may die out completely
    (in which case it stays dead permanently), it may repeat its
    initial configuration after some number of generations (in
    which case it continues to repeat with the same period
    indefinitely), or exhibit more complex behaviors.</span></p>

    <p><span>We are interested in understanding rules that, like
    Life, have a transition rule defined by counting the live cells
    among the eight cells surrounding each cell. Sometimes these
    are called "semitotalistic" rules. We define a rule by a string
    <tt>Bxx/Syy</tt> where the xx's and yy's are replaced by digits
    indicating the numbers of live neighbors leading to a birth or
    survival respectively. In this system, Life is denoted <tt>
    B3/S23</tt>.</span></p>

    <p><span>Each of the patterns depicted on this site is linked
    to a file in "RLE" (run-length-encoded) format, suitable for
    input to many cellular automaton simulation packages. The
    format begins with a line describing the x and y dimensions of
    the pattern, and the rule in which the pattern should be run.
    The next lines contain sequences of the characters <tt>b</tt>,
    <tt>o</tt>, and <tt>$</tt>. The <tt>b</tt> character stands for
    a dead cell, and the <tt>o</tt> character stands for a live
    one. The <tt>$</tt> character means to end one line of the
    pattern and start a new line. Any of these characters can be
    preceded by a number; this tells the simulator to act as if it
    had seen that many copies of the character, so e.g. <tt>3o</tt>
    makes a row of three live cells while <tt>3$</tt> starts a new
    line after leaving two blank (completely dead) lines. The file
    is ended by an exclamation mark character. For instance, the <a
    href="replicators/">replicator</a> in the <a href= 
    "replicators/b36s23.html">HighLife rule (B36/S23)</a> looks
    like this:</span></p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="replicators/b36s23.gif" width="23" height="23" alt=
      "HighLife 2c/12 replicator" />
    </div>

    <p><span>This turns into the following RLE-encoded
    file:</span></p>

<pre style="margin-left:1cm;"><span>
x = 5, y = 5, rule = B36/S23
bb3o$bobbo$o3bo$obbo$3o!
</span>
</pre>
