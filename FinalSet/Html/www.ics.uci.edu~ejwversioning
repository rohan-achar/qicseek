<H1>Versioning and Configuration Management of<BR>
World Wide Web Content</H1>

<HR>

<p>
This page was previously the home page for a working group on
adding versioning and configuration management capabilities to
the World Wide Web.  This working group has now been split -- the
current working group is now focusing on remote configuration management
of web content.  Discussion of WWW versioning issues now takes place
in the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/">
WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group (webdav)</A>.
</p>

<p>
This page is still an excellent resource for pointers to work on
WWW versioning and configuration management, as well as hypertext
versioning.

Four Lessons Learned from Managing World Wide Web Digital Libraries</A>,<BR>
Robert Pettengill and Guillermo Arango<BR>
<BR>
This early paper describes a development and maintenance process for a
"digital document library" (a.k.a., a collection of WWW content), the
need to make this process repeatable and as automated as possible, and
the use of separate maintenance and publications areas for visibility
control.  More relevant to this audience, the paper describes the need
for using version control on web content, the addition of a ",version"
to the requested URL, and explains the use of CGI scripts to
provide versioned access to a document collection.</P>

MKS has developed HTTP server extensions for checkin, checkout, and
locking operations on specific entities.  Individual versions of an
entity may be accessed by specifying the version with the addition of
";version=" at the end of the requested URL.  The MKS approach,
described in a <A HREF="http://www.mks.com/solution/ie/ie_spec.htm">
white paper</A>, makes no modifications to HTTP, and
instead decorates the requested URL with the information of the
desired operation.</P>

WWW Versioning Support, draft proposal (v 0.1)</A>
(<A HREF="file://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/ejw/www_vers.ps">Postscript</A>)
<BR>
Jim Whitehead<BR>
<BR>
This working draft describes a proposal for extending the HTTP
protocol with four new methods, FLAG, LOCK, UNLOCK, and USE, and
describes how they are used to provide style-independent versioning
with semantics controlled by the client.  Two appendicies give
examples of how the RCS and CVS styles are implemented using these
methods.  The proposal also describes a new entity type, the
<em>configuration</em>, which allows the versions of a collection of
related entities to be described in a single file.

<BR>
NTT Software Laboratories in Palo Alto (SPLA) recently announced on
the HTTP Working Group mailing list that they have completed a
prototype of an HTTP server which manages versions and configurations
of web objects.  While they apparently have a white paper which is
written in Japanese, and is currently undergoing translation into
English, some technical details were reported in the post.  The
versioning and configuration functions were implemented using LINK,
PUT, and "related methods".  Clients which understand how to use
these new functions have also been developed.</P>

<P>The NTT server is written in Perl.  Two clients were developed, one
using MetaCard, a GUI builder, along with a libwww library extended
to handle the additional methods.  The other client was written in
Java.</P>

The authoring tools breakout session identified the "lost update"

overwrite each other's changes) as an open issue requiring attention.
David Long of NaviSoft and Dan Connolly of W3C subsequently produced a
W3C working draft on the lost update problem titled,

Using Versioning to Support Collaboration on the WWW</A>,<BR>

David G. Durand</A><BR>
<BR>

This paper, presented at the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/Conferences/WWW4/">
WWW4</A> conference, presents a different, interesting perspective
on how versioning of WWW content may be performed.  Their approach is
motivated by how to support asynchronous collaboration in the creation
and editing of text documents, which they feel requires extremely
fine-grain versioning.  This paper describes VTML, the Versioned Text
Markup Language, which is a markup language for describing the version
history of a document.  The VTML approach has the drawback that it
only applies to HTML content, and does not address the versioning
of bitmap images, an important class of web content.</P>

<H2>Hypertext Versioning Literature</H2>

<P>The topic of hypertext versioning has been researched outside of
the WWW context within the academic hypertext community for several
years, and offers many insights into the WWW versioning problem.
Versioning of hypertexts was addressed by Ted Nelson in Literary
Machines, and in Engelbart's NLS journal facility in the 60's and
70's.  This issue was revisited and given renewed importance
by Frank Halasz in his extremely influential paper, "Reflections
on NoteCards: Seven Issues for the Next Generation of Hypermedia
Systems," published in Communications of the ACM in July, 1988, in
which he lists hypertext versioning as issue number 5.  These
issues were reexamined in a

keynote address</A> given by Halasz at
