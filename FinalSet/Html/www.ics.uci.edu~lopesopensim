<tr> <td><p> <a href="http://opensimulator.org">OpenSimulator</a> is an open
  source application server and a framework for developing 3D virtual
  environments a-la Second Life. I became involved with this project
  back in 2008 during my first sabbatical; I was looking for an
  opportunity to reconnect with software development in the real
  world. I haven't stopped since then.</p></td>
