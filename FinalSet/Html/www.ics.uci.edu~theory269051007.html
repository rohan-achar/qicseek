<h1>The Weighted Maximum-Mean Subtree and Other 
Bicriterion Subtree Problems</h1>

<h2>Josiah Carlson</h2>

<h3>October 7, 2005, in CS 259</h3>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>We consider problems in which we are given a rooted tree as input, and must 
find a subtree with the same root, optimizing some objective function of 
the nodes in the subtree. When this function is the sum of constant node 
weights, the problem is trivially solved in linear time. When the objective 
is the sum of weights that are linear functions of a parameter, we show how 
to list all optima for all possible parameter values in O(n log n) time; 
this parametric optimization problem can be used to solve many bicriterion 
optimizations problems, in which each node has two values xi and yi 
associated with it, and the objective function is a bivariate function 
f(SUM(xi),SUM(yi)) of the sums of these two values. A special case, when f 
is the ratio of the two sums, is the Weighted Maximum-Mean Subtree Problem, 
or equivalently the Fractional Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem on 
Trees; for this special case, we provide a linear time algorithm for this 
problem when all weights are positive, improving a previous O(n log n) 
solution, and prove that the problem is NP-complete when negative weights 
are allowed.</p>
