<H2>Making Anchors and Links in Switched Web</H2>

<p>&nbsp;

and add them to the link. You should the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> You should be in the flight_web
    <li> Jimage should be connected to the Chimera Server and have the
	following images displayed:
	<ul>
	<li> x-1.jpg
	<li> x-1_flying.gif
	</ul>
</ul>

<H3>Creating a new Link</H3>

<p>
Create a new link called x1 on the Chimera Server and make it the 
Active Link.
</p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/x1_link.gif" WIDTH="470"
HEIGHT="203"></CENTER>

<p>
