Thanks!
We were in contact in the past.
I didn't succeed to locate my family brunch in yours because I don't have
full names and birth cities of my family (no written records due to W.W.II).
It is nice to have an Langsam.com in our world (seen it once somewhere)

Hi, 
I know that we have. I was hoping maybe you had more. Anyhow, would it be possible 
to re-tell what you know please? I have found many more branches in the last couple 
of years and might be able to "hang" yours. I connected two earlier today. 
Also, what is your connection to Rama Dunayevich? 
Many thanks for your indulgence.

Hello there !


I am still connected (same E-mail).


My previous trials to locate any connections in your site, didn't succeed.
I know that my father's uncle went to USA before W.W.I (1913).


I visit Langsam site from time to time.


Thanks
Langsam Jacob

Hi,
Thanks for your response! I have unpublished material and would really appreciate 
any cooperation you could give. It might help put more of the tree together. Would 
you mind terribly telling me a little about your ancestry? Where they were from in 
Europe? Who was the earliest known Langsam in your branch? When did they live?
Thanks so much for any consideration you can give this,
-Moishe Miller

PS: 
Who was your father's uncle?

Hi,
Thanks for the reply, but still nothing clear that I see.

Do you know anything about Moris? Do you have ANY Langsam cousins here in the USA?

Hi,
I have been using the Ellis Island Database to find out more details about the various Langsam 
branches. Can you tell me a little more about your own grandfather Yakov. Who did he marry? Who 
were his children? 
Also, aside from this grandfather's children. Do you know of ANY other Langsam relatives anywhere 
in the world?
Thanks!
