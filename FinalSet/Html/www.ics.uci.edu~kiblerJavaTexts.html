  <ul>
   <li> <em>The Java Programming Language </em> by Ken Arnold, James
   Gosling and David Holmes. 3rd Edition.
    <br> Covers fundamentals of language, but not important packages. Accurate
description of language. Where I go when I need a deeper understanding
of some feature of the language. Covers Collections. This is the book I recommend.
   <li> <em> Java: An Introduction to Computer Science and Programming </em>
by Walter Savitch.
<br> Straightforward and complete introduction to language that can be used by
people with no programming experience.
Students like this text.
   <li> <em> Introduction to Programming Using Java: An Object-Oriented 
approach  </em> by David Arnold  and David Weiss. 
<br>Introduction to 
object-oriented programming using Java. Meant as a first CS course text.
I liked it.
  <li> <em> Up to Speed with Swing</em> by  Steven Gutz. Assumes you know Java
and introduces basic Swing classes. Readable.
   <li> <em> Computing Concepts using Java Essentials </em> by Cay Horstmann.
   <br> Covers Java for the beginning programming student. Used in 1A.
   <li> <em>Core Java 2nd Ed </em> by Cay Horstmann and Gary Cornell
    <br> language + applets, user-interface, delegation event-model (JDK 1.1),
     and new graphical widgets (e.g. scrollpane).
   <li> <em> Java in a Nutshell (2nd Edition)</em> (JDK 1.1)
   <br> A complete  brief description of the language plus a list of the
  methods and classes in the JDK 1.1 packages. JDK 1.0 had 8 packages
and JDK 1.1 has 23. Moreover the old packages have been extended.
These new packages cover important extensions such
as JavaBeans, reflections, serialization, JAR, and a new delegation
event-model which replaces the old model.
   <li> <em> Thinking in Java </em> by Bruce Eckel. 
<br>This text covers
 JDK 1.1 with some information about JDK 1.2.  It is meant
for the serious programmer who
has already programmed in some language, preferably C++. I like this
text a lot. He provides practical advice. The text covers  the
topics in Java in a Nutshell in greater depth.
   <li> <em>Graphic Java 1.1: Mastering the AWT </em> 2nd Ed.
   <br> thorough discussion of components, lightweight components, custom
  components. More than you want  to know. Good reference.
   <li> <em>Symantic Visual Caf&eacute; Sourcebook </em> by Cary Jardin and Pam
 Dixon. A complete guide to Creating Java Applets and applications with
 <em>Visual Caf&eacute; </em>. Note: only similar to Visual Cafe Pro.
   <li> For an up-to-date discussion of the Java and its use, see  
 http://www.javasoft.com/.
   <li> Any book that covers JDK1.1 that you can learn from. Everyone
  learns differently.
