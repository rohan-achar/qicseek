<h1>Euler's Formula,
Proof 4: Induction on Edges
</H1>

By combining the two previous proofs we get an induction
with a much simpler base case.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the connected planar graph G has no edges, it is an isolated vertex
and V+F-E=1+1-0=2.  Otherwise, choose any edge <I>e</I>.  If <I>e</I>
connects two vertices,
contract it, reducing V and E by one.  Otherwise, it is a Jordan curve
and separates two faces; remove it and reduce F and E by one.
In either case the result follows by induction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This is the proof used by <a href="refs.html#vLW">van Lint and Wilson</a>.
Other variants are possible -- if <I>e</I> connects two vertices and
separates two faces,
we may choose in various ways whether to delete or contract <I>e</I>.
