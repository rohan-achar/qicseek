<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">The <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>main aims of this
term project are to determine (a) whether users have troubles finding the <a href="http://www.lib.uci.edu/services/rcs/research-consultation-request-form.html">web page for making appointments with a librarian</a>,
and (b) whether they are satisfied with the confirmation message that
they receive once they submitted an appointment request. Other comments
from them on the usability of this page, or the Libraries website in
general, are also welcome.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">The project
should be carried out by <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m10999/f29646/t325255/p566464/">pairs of <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> INF 131 students</a> (the
"experimenters")<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">You can sign up for a project team <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/signupsheet/12winf131signup/">here</a> (join an existing student </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">if you don't have a partner yet</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">, or open up a new team). The
outcome of the
project should be a written report that addresses the above aims. The term papers
are due by <span style="font-weight: bold;">March 18</span> in <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/dropbox/index.php?op=openfolder&amp;folder=260270">this </a><a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/dropbox/index.php?op=openfolder&amp;folder=260270">dropbox</a>.
The <em>estimated</em> work time is 2 hours for the experiment (10
minutes each subject, and one hour for setup), 2-3 hours for analyzing the videos, and about a day
for
writing
the report. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">This project
will be conducted in collaboration with the UCI Libraries who
    will be very eager to read about your
findings.</font></p>

1. Choice of Loation, Time, Computer, Capture Software 
and Web Browser</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several days
before the experiment, determine where you will run the experiment and
what computer you will use. <br>
</font></font></p>
<dl>
  <dd><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="font-style: italic;">Location:</span>
The
location
should
have
a
desk
and three
chairs as well as Internet connectivity that is good enough for web
browsing. It should be indoors or at least in the shade so that
subjects can easily view the screen. Subjects should also not
become distracted by others, nor
distract
others by their talking. The best strategy is to install yourselves at
some public space and to lure nearby students to your experiment,
rather than asking people to come to a specific location at a specific
time. <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Computer:</span> The computer should have a screen of at least 13",
 be
powerful enough
to
run
screen &amp; audio recording software while the test user browses the web, and
record
audio
through
an
internal or external microphone. <br>
    </font></font></dd>
  <dd><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="font-style: italic;">Screen and Audio Recording ("Screencasting") Software:</span> Any such software is fine as long as
you are able to eventually create an integrated video/audio file that can be
played
in
Windows Media Player or Quicktime. HCI professionals typically use <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/download/camtasiatrial.asp">Camtasia Studio</a> (for
Mac and PC) </font>or <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/company/contact/moraetrial.asp">Morae
Recorder</a> (for PC only), which both have a 30-day free trial period. In addition, many freeware and shareware choices exist, both for <a href="http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/10-free-screen-recording-softwares-for-creating-attractive-screencasts/">Windows</a> (the Libraries like <a href="http://camstudio.org/">CamStudio</a>) and <a href="http://www.technobuzz.net/screen-capture-apps-for-mac">MacOS</a> <a href="http://www.technobuzz.net/screen-capture-apps-for-mac"></a></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">.</font></font></dd>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Install your
    recording software, restart the computer, launch your web
      browser and the
    screen/audio recorder, and record some of your own web browsing with
    oral commentary. Make sure that this software does not noticeably slow
    down your web browsing. If it does, reduce the color depth of the
    recording, down to grayscale if needed. If this is not enough, reduce the
      frame rate of the recording, down to four frames per second if needed.
      If this
      does
      not
      help either, use a faster computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">PC users will most likely need an external microphone.<br>

4. Report and CD/DVD:</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Draft the report very soon after performing
the experiment, so that you will better recall details that may be
important.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">To
prepare the report, you should replay and analyze the videos. Take
notes while watching them. <br>
</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Compare your notes with the notes that you
took during the experiment.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Draft a report that discusses</font></li>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">whether users have troubles finding the <a href="http://www.lib.uci.edu/services/rcs/research-consultation-request-form.html">web page for making appointments with a librarian</a></font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">whether they are satisfied with the confirmation message that they receive once they submitted an appointment request, <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">anything else that users reported or that you observed, and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">recommendations for design improvements that you may have.<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
<li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">If your subjects encounter problems with other
parts of the website (e.g., with its interface design and/or
information organization), then also describe those together with possible suggestions for
design improvements.</font></li>


  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Write
a
report of around 8 pages about your user study (use the
default format of MS Word, which means single-spaced, 1" margin at the
top and bottom, 1.25" margin left and right, and 10pt extra space after
new paragraphs). About 1-2 pages total should be non-textual, including
e.g. figures and tables with some of your results, [annotated] screen
shots
that illustrate what you explain in
your text, or mockups that show your redesign.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">The report
will be graded based on</font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">the
clarity of your description of what the user did and said, and what problems
          s/he
encountered (feel free to quote users verbatim if it is important)<br>
</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">the
thoughtfulness of your analysis of why these problems occurred</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">the
thoughtfulness of your recommendations for improvement (less important)</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Submit a single copy of your report and make sure it includes the names of both students but not their IDs. Since your
report will be forwarded to  the UCI Libraries you may also omit your
      names, but then send both names to the <a href="http://www.usabart.nl">TA</a>. Note though that the UCI Libraries sometimes hire INF
      131 students.<br>
</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Upload your
report to the class <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/dropbox/index.php?op=openfolder&amp;folder=260270">dropbox</a>,
by <span style="font-weight: bold;">March 18 at 11:55pm</span> at the latest.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Burn a CD/DVD
or create a USB stick with your audio/video recording in a format that is compatible with
Windows Media Player or Quicktime. Write both names on
      it, and turn it in
at the beginning of the final exam on <span style="font-weight: bold;">March 22 at 8am.</span></font></li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><br>
5. Some advice on the report:</b></font></p>
<ul>
  
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Include some statistics on the demographics of the subjects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Do not use subjects' real names, but rather codes like "Subject 1" or similar.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Organize your
report preferably by issue and not by subject. You can then "summarize"
certain findings by saying things like "4 out of 6 subjects were not
able to find..."<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">When describing user
      actions and associated problems/difficulties, state them clearly. For example: "The
      user clicked on the <insert name="" of="" link="" button="" whatever=""> &lt;insert name
      of link/button/whatever&gt; to go to the &lt;descriptive name&gt;" is
      better than "She went to the link on the left to go to the next page." You
  can't receive credit for what we have to guess you mean.</insert></font></li>

  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Your
  criticism and recommendations in your report should be based on HCI and web
      design guidelines presented in class (but you are welcome to also present
      a
  few personal opinions that are not grounded in HCI theory).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">No, you don't
need an "IRB approval" for this user study (don't bother if you don't know
what this is).</font></li>
</ul>
