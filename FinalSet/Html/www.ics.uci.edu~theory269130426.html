<h1>
Popularity vs maximum cardinality in the stable marriage setting 
</h1>

Presented by Pawel Pszona
</h2>

<p>
In the stable marriage setting, the notion of pupularity of a matching is introduced.
I will present a new algorithm for computing a maximum cardinality popular matching.
Generalized version of this algorithm utilizes an interesting tradeoff
between cardinality and popularity of a matching.
