    JEWS IN CRACOW AT THE TIME OF THE
<BR> CONFEDERACY OF BAR (1768-72)
</H3>

<P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the saddest chapters in the history of Cracow
is the period of the Confederacy of Bar (1768-72).
For decades afterwards old people used to recall those terrible days
when the city frequently changed hands and the soldiers, both Russian
and Bar, plundered shops, set fire to the suburbs and even to the
houses in the city, took as prisoners either real or supposed followers
of the "enemy" and, through oppressive extortions and forced deliveries,
squeezed the last pennies out of merchants, artisans
and even clergy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For Jews this period was even more terrible than for
the other citizens.  Both the Russians and the Confederates considered
the Jews as enemies from the start.  Without mercy they hung Jews on
branches of trees.  Both sides demanded heavy deliveries of bread and
meat, quartering of soldiers and also armed help and espionage service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even before this confederacy, i.e. during the time
of the Radom Confederacy and before the time that the Warsaw Sejm,
upon the order of Repnin, had decided to give equal rights to the
dissenters, the followers of the old order attempted to prevent this
through various means.  Priests denounced equal rights from their
pulpits as the act of the devil and attempted through defamatory
pamphlets to undermine Repnin's aims.  One such satire is the
"Manifesto of the Confederated Israelite Nobility,
of the Foreign Nations, of the Former Inhabitants of Jerusalem."
It was distributed by special messengers among various cities and was
also copied from hand to hand.  In this manifesto, the Jews supposedly
complain that while the rights of nobility and equal rights are being
given to Lutherans and Orthodox, they, the ancient Jerusalem nobility,
older than any other, are omitted.  In order to provide a semblance of
veracity to this complaint, the author depicts the Jews as complaining
of their unhappy condition and the way in which they are despised by
various circles among the people.  "No one has respect for us," they
say.  "On the contrary, only too frequently does each one of us have
a stone from a Christian lad fly by our head." The pamphlet is set in
the chancery style of the Polish documents of the Jewish councils, even
though the Councils of the Lands had ceased to exist since 1764. . . .</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This pamphlet was only a political anecdote.  Following
it came the tragic reality--the Confederacy of Bar.  Immediately after
it was started in Bar the news reached Cracow.  Specially manufactured
newspapers, dated Warsaw, were distributed throughout the city.  Residents
read with gusto "of the victories of the Confederates over the Russians,
of the triumphs of Pulawski over Padgorichanin, Kretchnikov and
Apraksin" and readily believed them.
They inwardly suppressed their enmity to their age-old enemies and their
allies on the Polish throne.  In time the nobility of the Cracow region
was divided into supporters and opponents of the Confederation and they
battled with each other in the Proszow Sejmik.  The townspeople and the
Jews stood in between and awaited whatever time and the future would
bring.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon the report came to the Cracow Town Hall that
the Confederates were routed and that Bar and Berdichev were captured.
To the Jewish town hall in Kazimierz came the report of the slaughter
at Urnan, in which almost all the Jews of the town were killed. There
was not too much time to meditate on these happenings.  On June 20,
1768 the wojewodztwo of the Confederation of Cracow was organized and
it selected as marshall the well-known play-boy and profilgate, Michal
Czarnocki, the owner of Secymin.  The very next day the Confederates
took over the Cracow garrison.  The town administration thereupon swore
allegiance, without hesitation, to Czarnocki.  Only the town-mayor,
Piotr Szaster, laid down his post.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These formalities were hardly completed when Russian
troops appeared outside the city and shooting began at the Slawkowska
gate.  In order to protect the city from sudden attack Czarnocki ordered
the city gates to be closed during the day and he introduced special
passes for those who had business outside the city gates.  This immediately
affected the Jews, who lived in Kazimierz but had their stores and
warehouses in Cracow.  Only a few succeeded in securing passes.  The
great majority could not get into Cracow and the Jewish shops, therefore,
remained closed for a long period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile the Russians, under Apraksin and Prozorovski,
encircled the city with an increasingly tight cordon.  They cut off
the supply of food and captured the small groups of Confederates who
had rushed to the aid of their comrades.  Nevertheless the siege lasted
for eight weeks.  The orders of Repnin, intended to hasten the end
of the war, were of no avail.  He advised the use of spies and Jews.
In order to force the Jews into submission he suggested that they be
threatened with exile deep into Russia or hanging upon the first suitable
branch.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon hunger began to be felt in Cracow. The burghers
demanded that the city surrender.  The Confederates, losing more and
more every day, attributed all their defeats to treason and searched
for spies everywhere.  Several "spies" were hung in the market place,
among them also Jews.  Among those hung was Ciszek, the officer of
the town garrison, who was accused of being in contact with the Russians.
The go-between was alleged to be Isaac of Kazimierz, a Jew from Sacz,
"who used to meet with a Cossack officer in the Kazimierz synagogue."
This allegation was reported by a memoir writer of the time and has
been repeated uncritically by all subsequent historians who did not
stop to reflect that in July 1768, Kazimierz was still in the hands
of the Confederates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Czarnocki saw that he would not be able to hold
Cracow, he ordered the Jews to supply 600 men.  Weeping, they told
him that there were altogether only 1,500 souls in the empty Jewish
city and he ordered them to pay 80,000 zlotys within a week.  The Jews
began to bargain with him and he became impatient.  He ordered the
parnes of the community (Fayvush Giesser) to be seized, and his head,
beard and ear-locks to be shaved.  He threatened to do the same to
others if one penny were missing from the sum he set.  The Jews temporarily
paid several thousand zlotys; they were relieved of paying the rest
by the Russians, who captured Kazimierz and the Jewish quarter on August
1, 1768.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Russians used Kazimierz as operations base to
storm Cracow during the following two weeks.  During this period they
used Jews to build trenches and bury their dead.  They also quartered
their soldiers in Jewish homes.  On August 17, the Russians entered
Cracow.  After they had driven the Confederates deep into Russia, they
made themselves comfortable in the city.  They imposed heavy tribute
upon the population and threatened hanging for the slightest provocation.
Drevich carried on more wildly than any other.  He would continue to
dispatch contingents of troops to capture the fortresses in the neighborhood,
Tyniec, Lanckorona and Czestochowa. The permanent Cracow commandant,
Lobry, was more humane.  The townspeople became intimate with him and
Jews also had access to him.  They served as purveyors for him and
sought his help in their struggle with their own co-religionists for
control of the community.  The rich Cracow Jew, Israel Aronovich, purveyor
of the mint, became a factor for Lobry.  He "loaned" huge sums to Lobry
as well as to the later commandants, and these "loans" were at the
expense of the Cracow Jewish community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Russians remained in Cracow a whole year.  On
September 3, they liquidated their command and left the city in order
to storm Czgstochowa, the strongest fortress of the Confederates.
Before they retired they ordered the Jews to pay 7,000 zlotys for the
supplies they were leaving behind in the Wawel warehouse.  These supplies
had been delivered by Jewish purveyors who had not been paid for them.
Now the Jewish community had to pay the required sum and the supplies
thereupon were taken over by the Confederates who occupied Cracow on
September 13.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new series of requisitions and forced deliveries
of goods, grain and wood now began.  Marshal Dzierzanowski had captured
the Wieliczka mines without a shot and he imposed upon the merchants,
craft guilds, clergy and Jews the obligation to buy 1,000 barrels of
salt at a very high price.  On the very first day he extracted 18,000
zlotys from various individuals.  Others paid for the salt later.
In return, however, they only received paper money, which lost its
value when the Confederates again abandoned Cracow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On November 9, 1769, the Confederates abandoned the
city.  The Russians returned and remained there until June, 1772, when
the first partition of Poland took place.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For two full years the impoverished and sacked city
had to support the Muscovite troops, who continued to carry out attacks
in various directions.  At the same time the inhabitants also suffered
from diversionary attacks made from time to time by the Confederates.
Thus on November 26, 1769, the hussars of Trzebinski and Paszkowski
attacked the Jewish quarter.  The Russian soldiers were then in the
Jewish bathhouse.  Many were hacked to death and others taken away
as prisoners.  The Jews, because they had "taken care of" the Russians,
paid for it with the plundering of their shops and warehouses. Such
attacks were repeated many times during the course of the winter of
1769-70, as on January 17, 1770, March 1, and March 4. On each occasion
the Confederates plundered the Jews or took them as prisoners.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The summer of 1770 was relatively calm.  But
the diversions and attacks were renewed in the winter of 1770-71.
On January 13, the Confederates attacked Kazimierz, managed to reach
the house of the commandant, Major Orszakow, killed some of his men
and took others prisoner.  Then they attacked Cracow.  They were not
successful and therefore also abandoned Kazimierz.  They thereupon
plundered the Jewish homes and dealt with the Jews in "so godless a
manner" that it seemed incredible to the correspondent of the <I>Hildesheimer</I>
<I>Relationskurrier. </I>The same correspondent estimated the Jewish
damage of that day at 300,000 zlotys.  Even though this sum is obviously
exaggerated it does testify to the great damage suffered by the Jews.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few days later Paszkowski's and Schutz's divisions
repeated the attack on Kazimierz.  They caught many Jews and dragged
them off.  Many of them were hung on the way.  Twelve others, among
them the <I>parnes, </I>Gutman Rakowski, were incarcerated in Lanckorona
and Wieliczka and 12,000 zlotys were demanded as ransom money.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rakowski could not endure the beating he was
subjected to upon his arrest on the way.  When he felt he was dying
he called Israel Davidovich and Levi Jakhimovich and dictated his will
in their presence.  From this we learn of the sufferings he endured
in prison, how his home in the Jewish quarter was destroyed, papers
worth more than 2,000 zlotys torn up, and how, "by whips" they extracted
from him the bit of cash he had taken with him on the road.  Rakowski
died in Lanckorona on June 18, 1771.  When his wife learned of the
death of her husband she gathered together her last pennies and, at
great risk, came to Lanckorona in order to redeem his body. The Confederates,
however, refused to lower the price they had previously set.  They
released only several of the Jews and kept the others in prison.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also very interesting that during this time
there was a Jew who, instead of helping his brothers, sought to make
a fortune out of the Jewish tragedy.  This was Nakhman of Kalwarja,
the factor of Korytowski and purveyor to Prince Czartoryski.  The families
of the captured Jews addressed a request to him that he intervene with
the Confederates in their behalf.  Through him, too, they sent food
and money for their unfortunate relatives.  Nakhman mercilessly took
the money for himself and in addition he persuaded Korytowski to increase
the rental fee for his "grey house" in Cracow, notwithstanding the
explicit prohibition by the Prince.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last heroic act of the Confederates was the
capture of the Wawel Castle.  Here they remained several months.
During this period one of their divisions again plundered the Jewish
quarter and dragged off a number of Jews as prisoners.  These were
kept for several months in the Wieliczka prison in hunger and cold.
A Jew, Aron Wielitchker, who allied himself with the Confederates,
helped make their lot worse.  On May 5, 1772, at-the end of the Confederate
period, the Cracow Jewish community excommunicated Nakhman.  But the
unfortunate prisoners continued to be held.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this time the partition treaty of the three great
powers had already been signed.  The foreign troops pecked, at the
living body of the Polish state like birds of prey.  Because of
the vague formulation of the treaty, the Austrians took over Kazimierz
and with it the Jewish quarter, while the Poles retained Cracow.  The
Jews of Cracow suddenly became subjects of Her Royal Majesty, Maria
Theresa.  They submitted to their new rulers a list of the damages
they had suffered at the hands of the Russians and the Confederates.
Jewish individuals suffered damages to the amount of 288,131 zlotys.
The community, according to the oath of the <I>parnosim, </I>also had
incurred expenses . . . . These they estimated at 130,000 zlotys.
Together the sum amounted to 418,131 zlotys.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was the flag under which the history of Cracow
Jews proceeded in those days of plagues, when every month, if not every
day, brought with it new restrictive orders and troubles, and when
the Jewish quarter was a battlefield commanded now by the Russians,
now by the Confederates.  Not one house in the city emerged intact.
Most of the stores were plundered and the community itself, including
its <I>parnosim, </I>was oppressed and disgraced.  These <I>parnosim
</I>and their syndics lived as on a volcano.  Every minute they were
called or dragged to another officer.  To each one they had to bow
their heads, appease him and stuff him with gold unless they wanted
to be hung on the first good branch of a tree or be hacked to death
in the gateway of their own house.  It is, therefore, no wonder that
the <I>parnosim </I>took money from whatever source they could.  They
would extort some from members of the community; some they would borrow
at exorbitant rates of interest, often up to 40 percent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the early period of the Confederacy of Bar,
the following <I>parnosim </I>stood at the head of the community without
interruption and without elections: Fayvush Giesser, Gutman Rakowski,
Dr. Mendl Kalahora, all allied with the well-known Jekeles family.
This family was represented in the council of the community by the
old Moyshe Jekeles, who was looked upon as the head of the community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jekeles family and their allies ruled over the
Cracow community for over 150 years.  Jewish families declined and
new ones rose to power, Jews became rich and Jews became poor, but
the Jekeles family continued to hold communal power.  They had to endure
more than one battle to maintain their control which they looked upon
as a hereditary power.  The fortune of the family came to be divided
up.  There were rich members of the family and poor ones.  Our Moyshe
was of the poor ones.  Notwithstanding his modest fortune and his old
age, which made him bent and hunch-backed, he possessed a firm spirit
and the pride of an aristocrat and he stood up courageously against
the machinations of his opponents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gutman Rakowski occupied the leading place in the
Jekeles faction.  Rakowski's grandfather had occupied a communal post.
In 1745 his father, Berl Rakowski, was among the <I>tuvim </I>and he
himself became that year one of the community councilors (<I>mezy</I>
or <I>dziewiecmezy). </I>During the years 1756-61, in the struggle
between the Jewish and non-Jewish merchants, Berl was also one of the
<I>tuvim </I>and all his goods were confiscated at that time. This
affected him so deeply that he became ill and soon died.  His son Gutman
took over his business as well as his debts.  It was this Gutman
who died in Lanckorona as a prisoner of the Confederates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Mendl Kalahora came from a well-known Sephardic
family. His father, Dr. Aron Kalahora, was the first Jew to receive
a diploma from the Cracow Academy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fayvush Giesser was a new figure in Cracow.  He came
from Zolkiew.  He married in Cracow and thanks to his family connections
soon became <I>parnes.  </I>In 1767 we find him in this post together
with Hershl Stobnitzki, one of the most powerful of the Cracow Jews.
These two had attempted to smooth over the trouble between the arrendator
of liquor taxes, Leizer Melekhiovich, and the trustee of <I>the hekdesh,
i.e. </I>the head of the charity committee, Jonah Rabinovich.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The incident was trivial but it created a great stir.
Melekhovich was arrendator of liquor taxes and he prevented the Jews
from selling liquor in their taverns.  That is why he was hated in
the towns.  Because he feared revenge, Leizer induced the provincial
government to take him out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish community
court and to provide him with a letter of protection.  The community
wanted to play a prank on him in return and it permitted one of its
members, Jonah Rabinovich, to rent Leizer's pew in the old synagogue.
Leizer became infuriated at the community and went to the officer of
the Kazimierz garrison, Antoni Eismond, who brought back to Jonah the
money he paid for Leizer's pew.  Jonah, in turn, turned the money over
to the trustees of the <I>hekdesh </I>(the pew belonged to them) and
then Eismond, with military escort, came to the meeting of the trustees,
read them the letter of the wojewoda and demanded to know if they were
ready to obey the commands of the wojewoda and respect the protective
documents he issued.  The trustees were not overawed by the officer's
threats and immediately turned the case over to the Jewish court.
The latter excommunicated Leizer and ordered him jailed.  The sextons
took Leizer to the jail next to the synagogue while Eismond's soldiers
took Jonah Rabinovich into custody and put him into the wojewoda
jail, <I>i.e. </I>in the local prison.  Fayvush Giesser, <I>parnes
</I>of the community, saw the danger in the situation and intervened.
He invited Eismond to the home of the rabbi, where Hershl Stobnitzki
and Dr. Kalahara were already waiting.  Unexpectedly Jonah arrived
too.  He had gotten out of jail.  He punched Eismond in the nose several
times.  The latter fainted and was revived by the rabbi's wife.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole affair was so strange that it came to the
wojewoda court.  After listening to testimony, the court decreed that
Jonah Rabinovich was to be imprisoned for six months and was not to
occupy any public post for six years.  Hershl Stobnitzki was sentenced
to two weeks in prison and was barred from public office for three
years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jonah was so broken up by this sentence that he never
again served as a <I>parnes.  </I>Stobnitzki emerged again a few years
later.  Both, however, could not be selected at the next communal election
and they were replaced by (in addition to Kalahora and Giesser) Rakowski,
Israel Aronovich and, as usual, by one of the Jekeles family-- Moyshe
Jekeles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even before the arrival of the Confederates these
<I>parnosim </I>had had great difficulties in collecting taxes and
in covering the communal debts that had reached astronomical proportions.
When the Confederates arrived, pillaging and hanging again set in.
Soon the Russians came and Capt. Lobry assumed command of the Cracow
garrison.  Aronovich, also known as Menashe's, became an intimate of
his.  He was made a purveyor for the Russian army and came to have
a powerful influence in the Jewish community and even in the city of
Cracow.  Israel, it is true, used his influence for the benefit of
the Jewish population but he did not mind spending communal money in
order to satisfy the military.  He made loans at high interest rates
and imposed increasingly high consumers taxes which poisoned the life
of the already impoverished Cracow Jewry.  By these methods Israel
managed to win over Lobry to his side and also his successors, Oebelschwitz
and Stahremberg, and, together with his four friends, automatically
occupied the posts of <I>parnosim </I>for four continuous years, without
rendering account to anyone over this long period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against "Jekeles' five" and his plunder-economy,
protests came from the Stobnitzkis (officially the father, Moyshe,
and behind the scenes, his son Hersh), Shimen Bass, Moyshe Braciejowski
and later the purveyor of the Warsaw mint, Fayvush Abrahamovich, who,
thanks to his position, was relieved of payments and had the right
to buy up silver coins throughout the country.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fayvush Abrahamovich came from Przedborz and was
apparently a relative or in-law of the famous Landau family.  Around
1750 he came to Cracow and there married the daughter of a rich
Jew, Avigdor ben Moyshe Gumprecht.   Avigdor had been a <I>parnes
</I>for several years but he had a bad reputation.  His father had
also been a <I>parnes </I>in the second decade of the 18th century,
but he was unable to give proper accounting of -the public funds and
he landed in the wojewoda prison in 1728.  In order to secure his release,
he extorted from the community secretary, Joshua Horowitz, a
written declaration that he had returned to him all accounts and receipts
as well as the 400 zlotys cash which he had been accused of appropriating.
Horowitz gave Moyshe such a declaration but on March 21, 1728, he withdrew
it in the presence of the syndic and vice-syndic and had his withdrawal
recorded in the wojewoda books.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Avigdor was no better than his father.  But a more
interesting type was his son-in-law, Fayvush Abrahamovich.  He won
the sympathy of the opposition elements in the community.  The enemies
of the Jekeles faction authorized him to induce the Russian authorities
to set the drawing of lots for the intermediate days of Passover.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faysush began with a clever trick.  He took advantage
of the fact
that Moyshe Jekeles was old, that Israel Aronovich was away on business
to Warsaw and that others were absent from the city or were imprisoned
by the Confederates so that only Dr. Mendl Kalahora could come to the
community house, and called together a meeting of some fifty Jews of
the town on February 2, 1772.  They passed the following resolution:</P>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the fact of the oppression and the sad
state of the community of Kazimierz near Cracow ... because of the
times of plagues, because of all kinds of armies everywhere . . . and
just because of this we endure suffering every minute and every hour
that cannot be recorded on paper, and especially because our city has
become empty, and we can no longer bear the burdens, and there is no
help or support to come from anywhere--we therefore have, with God's
help, decided not to allow that the Jews be scattered from the city
and we have decided to select several people to complete the number
of <I>roshim </I>[heads] missing on the <I>kahal board:</I> inspectors
of accounts <I>(roei heshbonot), hekdesh </I>trustees, and nine <I>kahal
</I>men. These newly selected men must be ready at any moment to help
the <I>tuvim </I>[optimates], control the schedule of duties and take
measures to collect them.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems likely that the opposition was more interested
in control than in aid.  But the incumbent <I>parnosim </I>did not
want to agree to this and luck was with them; the very same day the
Confederates captured the Wawel Castle, shooting began and there was
no opportunity for discussion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fayrush Abrahamovich did not give up.  Thirsting
for revenge against the Jekeles faction, he paid no attention to personal
dangers nor to material damages and he determined to crush all obstacles
in order to carry through new elections and secure the <I>kahal</I>
mandates for himself and for his supporters.  Since Rzewuski, the Cracow
wojewoda, was a prisoner of the Russians, it was necessary to appeal
to the highest authorities in Warsaw to get permission to carry through
the elections.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fayvush, therefore, went to Warsaw.  He succeeded
in winning over the chancellor, Father Mlodziejowski, and the latter
invited the Russian General Waynmarn and several staff-officers to
dinner several times in order to get them to permit the elections for
the Cracow <I>kahal. </I>Waynmarn issued the appropriate order to the
Cracow commandant Oebelschwitz, and the latter immediately gave his
consent to issue such a permit.  He only expressed his "unofficial
opinion that the new <I>kahal </I>council would be adapted to the demands
of the Russian army both in respect to loyalty and in respect to supplies,
transport, spies and the like"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to assure the commandant of his loyalty,
Fayvush gave him, as he later testified, 500 zlotys.  Before he received
the rescript for the elections, however, Oebelschwitz left his post
and was succeeded by Capt.  Stahremberg. Stahremberg also adhered to
the view of his predecessor regarding "the benefits which the Russian
command had derived from the old <I>kahal" </I>and had planned to make
such a report to his superiors.  But Fayvush anticipated this and sent
him a present (certainly not out of his own pocket.) of 200 ducats.
In his notes on this, Fayvush added the interesting comment that "Stahremberg
had yielded only after much pleading and importuning . . . But [when
he took the 200 ducats] he had done him a great favor, because he could
have, had he wanted, taken three times as much from the old <I>parnosim."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Armed with Stahremberg's permit, Fayvush now
played the role of a formalist and decided to carry out the drawing
of lots, in accordance with law, with the assistance of the Jewish
judge.  The Jewish judge, Kurdwanowski, a well-known adherent of the
Confederates, lived in hiding outside Cracow.  Fayvush turned to Sebastjan
Badeni, the judge of the Cracow castle and inspector of the mint, to
get him into the Jewish quarter in Kazimierz and to intervene with
the commandant of the city.  Badeni undertook the mission for the price
of 100 ducats. He invited Stahremberg to lunch and secured from him
a safe-conduct for a short term. Protected by such a safe-conduct,
the Jewish judge arrived in Kazimierz.  He collected 100 ducats, however,
for his expenses and labors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New elections were now held for the <I>kahal.  </I>The
old council was deposed and Fayvush Abrahamovich, Hershl Stobnitzki
and their supporters were elected as the new <I>parnosim. </I>As soon
as it was constituted, the new <I>kahal </I>carried out an examination
of the accounts of the preceding four years.  At the same time it issued
an announcement calling upon all who had any information to declare
on oath in what ways they had been wronged by Israel Aronovich and
his friends.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to annoy him further, Fayvush had Israel
put into the pillory in the old synagogue and then he issued a very
severe sentence upon him which was pronounced in the same synagogue
with black candles and with the call of the shofar.  While listening
to the verdict, Israel stood bound in heavy chains and his pew in the
synagogue was draped in black as for one who had died.  After the ceremony
Israel was paraded through the city to the jail.  When his mother,
an old lady of 70, tried to approach him, Fayvush pushed her away with
such force that she fell to the earth and fainted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Israel remained in prison for several weeks.  Only
when his wife brought Fayvush cash and securities valued at 300 ducats
was he released and he had to swear that he would not seek satisfaction
in the state courts.  At the same time he signed a declaration that
he had given Fayrush the 300 ducats of his own good will and without
pressure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No sooner had Israel left the walls of the jail than
he proceeded immediately to Cracow, dispatched a thundering protest
to the regional court and hired horses to go to Warsaw to seek the
aid of his protectors.  Fayvush heard of all this immediately and he
ordered Israel's wife to summon her husband to the Jewish quarter.
When she refused he ordered Israel to be excommunicated the following
Sabbath and had the ban proclaimed in six synagogues.  To wreak his
vengeance still further he had Israel's wife roused out of bed and,
with an escort of 15 night-watchmen carrying lanterns, taken to the
old synagogue to hear the excommunication proclaimed against her husband.
Fayvush also vented his rage on Israel's daughter; he took away from
her fiance the securities which her father had deposited for her dowry.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Israel knew of all that was going on.  His good friends
informed him how Fayvush was maltreating his wife and daughter and
insulting him and his near ones.  He therefore spared no money or energy
to gain access to the occupying powers.  With the aid of friends among
the nobility he secured an order to Stahremberg from the Russian General
Bibikov that the investigation of the quarrel between the former and
present <I>parnosim </I>of the <I>kahal </I>be reopened.  Bibikov also
ordered that two ranking Russian officers participate in the investigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fayvush Abrahamovich was afraid of the reopening
of the investigation, especially since he did not know how the Russian
officers would behave.  Through the intervention of Badeni, he secured
permission to have two Polish officers at the hearing of testimony.
The commission thus included Major Artzybashev and a captain (name
unknown) from the Russian side; the Jewish judge, Kurdwanowski, and
the sub-delegate from Cracow, Krowicki, for the Polish side.  Fayvush
bribed them all.  He even sent gifts to the investigators and the secretaries.
He derived little benefit from it, however.  Major Artzybashev sent
the record of the proceedings to Stahremberg and the latter sent it
immediately to General von Roenne at Lublin.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one in Cracow knew who was in charge of civil
affairs in the Russian command in Lublin.  Fayvush, therefore, sent
a special messenger to secure this information.  It turned out that
the civil commissioner was Major Hoshan, Lobry's former aide, and a
good friend of Fayvush.  Fayvush despatched 200 ducats to win him over
to his side.  Without even reading the records, Hoshan returned them
to Cracow with an order to Stahremberg that he deal with the matter
himself.  Stahrenberg turned the dossier over to the reporter, Piotr
Szaster, the former mayor of Cracow and now an official in the commandatura.
Szaster examined the whole case, recognized Fayvush's guilt and ordered
him to pay 200 ducats to Israel and 100 to the Jewish community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fayvush was not successful this time in making an
appeal.  He was immediately taken into custody and forced to pay the
above-mentioned sums. He was detained even after payment until further
word came from higher channels, first from Moscow, then from Prussia,
and finally from Austria.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just at this time the Russians left Cracow and Kazimierz
and turned the cities over to the Prussians.  The latter also left
soon and on June 11, 1772, both cities were occupied by Austrian troops.
Later the Austrians left Cracow but retained Kazimierz, which is on
the right bank of the Vistula.  General D'Alton set up his command
headquarters first in Wieliczka, later in Tarnow.  Only the district
office was left in Wieliczka and the commanding officer there was Joseph
von Baum.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The members of the former <I>kahal </I>quickly oriented
themselves to the situation.  Taking advantage of the fact that Fayvush
was still in jail, they sent Israel to Wieliczka to sound out the new
rulers.  Israel was able to reach D'Alton and he gave him his version
of the whole matter.  D'Alton, not having the slightest notion of what
had been going on in the city for years, immediately dispatched his
lieutenant-auditor, Mansack, to Cracow and gave him Dobrowolski as
aide.  The latter soon became the Jewish judge for the Austrians.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mansack treated Fayvush as a criminal.  He was kept
in jail, and sent to court and to the investigating magistrate under
guard.  The gifts which Fayvusli sent to both officials were of no
avail.  Mansack assembled all the Jews in the synagogue, ordered the
old <I>kahal de</I>posed and a new one elected.  The new one consisted
for the most part of the Jekeles faction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, Fayvush got out of jail.  He immediately
charged Mansack with taking bribes and bringing harm to the Austrian
authority.  D'Alton had Mansack arrested but he took no action
on the matter itself but transferred it to Lemberg.  To Lemberg, therefore,
went Avigdor, the father-in-law of Fayvush and he succeeded in having
the matter directed "temporarily" to Wieliczka for further investigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime Shloyme Rabinovich, son-in-law of
Moyshe Jekeles, delivered to Emperor Joseph <I>ein alluntertanigstes
Immediatgesuch, </I>in which he described in detail the "robberies
and bribes" of the incumbent <I>kahal </I>elders.  Joseph II turned
over the request to the Lemberg authorities and the governor appointed
a commission to investigate the charges.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was the beginning of Austrian rule in Kazimierz.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this terrible period, a time of civil war
and of conflicts between Jewish factions, the fight also continued
between the Jews and the Kazimierz magistrates concerning the right
to trade in the Jewish town and also with the Cracow magistrates concerning
trade and work in Cracow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The constitution of 1768 had declared that in those
cities where there were no agreements with the Jews, commercial agreements
be made with them.  It did not indicate, however, who was to take the
initiative, what sort of agreements they were to be and what was to
be done if the authorities did not want to make such an agreement.
The matter was given some attention in Cracow and in Kazimierz but
no progress was made because just at that time, in 1768, Cracow was
occupied first by the Confederates and then by the Russians.  When
the Russian occupation continued on, however, and the Jews in Cracow
once again opened their shops and warehouses and some of them did quite
well with military supplies, the municipal authorities remembered their
old headache and once again entered charges against the Jews in the
Assessor's Court in Warsaw.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On June 30, 1769, the trial opened.  The municipal
authorities were represented by Jan Nepomucen Slominski, the Jewish
community by Antoni Opelewski.  The court postponed the case because
both sides had failed to present their documents in time.  The case
was resumed over a year later, on November 7, 1770.  This time the
municipality was represented by Pawel Bialobrzeski and the Jews again
by Opelewski.  Opelewski proposed the agreement of 1609, which Wladyslaw
IV had confirmed in 1630 and which stipulated that in case of conflict
the Jews were to come not under the jurisdiction of the Assessors Court
but under that of the wojewoda.  Bialobrzeski appealed to the constitution
of 1764 and claimed that the Assessors Court was competent to try the
case.  The court agreed with the conclusions of the lawyer for the
Jews and sent the case to the Cracow wojewoda with the comment that
he should see to it that the litigants arrange a commercial agreement
between them, with the right of appeal to the Assessor's Court.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately for the Jews, the Cracow wojewoda,
Rzewuski, was a prisoner of the Russians and the Jewish judge Kurdwanowski,
a supporter of the Confederates, was in hiding in the suburbs of the
city. There was no authority, therefore, that could take the case in
hand and the officials took advantage of this and began, on their own,
to shut down Jewish shops and to confiscate the goods.  The Jews thereupon
hastened to Commandant Oebelschwitz and he, in turn, sent a letter
to his superior, General Waynmarn in Warsaw, inquiring what he should
do in the matter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waynmarn forbade the Cracow commandant to interfere
in a matter which was not his concern. Meanwhile the municipal officials
were able to secure from King Stanislaw August (December 8, 1770) a
confirmation of the decree of 1750 of August III, which forbade the
Jews from carrying on trade in Cracow.  The city officials immediately
called the Jewish elders to the Town Hall, read the decree to them
and ordered them immediately to close up their shops and cease their
trade. On December 17, 1770, the Jews entered a protest and on December
29, they submitted a memorandum that the city officials had again begun
to confiscate Jewish property as in the years 1742-1761. The city officials
paid scant attention to the protests and on January 3, 1771, they publicly
proclaimed the royal decree and continued to confiscate Jewish goods,
although a bit more cautiously.  They were cautious because they did
not know how the occupying power would view the matter and Waynmarn's
instructions to Oebelschwitz were not known in the city. There was
a series of protests and counter protests until the matter came back
to the Assessor's Court.  The Christian party sought to hasten the
trial, the Jews to delay it.  The Russian army in Kazimierz was forcing
the Jews to repair the city and at the same time the Jews could not
gain access to their archives and get the needed documents.  The Jewish
<I>parnosim </I>could not leave the city to go to intervene in Warsaw.
They had to stand guard over their person and property.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jewish community appealed on February 26, 1771
to the chancellor, Father Mlodziejowski, and he intervened by asking
the Cracow magistrate to conclude "any sort of peace" with the Jews.
The Jews also addressed themselves to the town-president "that, out
of respect for the letter of protection of the chancellor he should
be inclined toward peace." The president was persuaded and he called
upon the Jews to present their trade proposals.  He set the condition,
however, that the basis for the negotiations should be the sacramental
agreement of 1485.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, on July 31 and August 1, 1771, the <I>kahal
parnosim</I> submitted an extensive memorial.  In it they described
their critical financial situation, the debts of the <I>kahal </I>and
of individual merchants and also the various imperial and <I>kahal
</I>taxes, all of which weighed most heavily upon them.  From this
memorial it appears that the Jews owed the shlakhta and the Polish
townsmen about 850,000 zlotys.  The debt to the foreign merchants amounted
to over 10,000 thaler.  In order to meet the <I>kahal </I>obligations,
they indicated that they needed 130,800 zlotys annually, which they
derived from the members of the community by direct taxes and consumer
taxes.  In order to carry this burden they had to have a source of
income and only trade could serve as such.  The Jews of Cracow had
engaged in trade since the most ancient times, notwithstanding the
interference of the gentile merchants.  They asked, therefore, not
for new rights or liberties but only that sanction be given to the
actual condition.  At the same time they wished to restrict their trade
only to the most necessary goods and they yielded the trade in luxury
goods to the Christian merchants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jews demanded the right to trade in the following
wares: (1) white goods: linen, canvass etc.; (2) woolen goods: cloth,
Dutch flannel, baize, mourning cloth, camlet; (3) silks; taffeta, damask;
(4) notions: pins, needles, buttons, scissors, tobacco cases etc.;
(5 ) furs: fur skins, rabbit, squirrel, etc.; (6) Turkish goods; rugs,
divans, night-caps, gloves, etc.; (7) spices: sugar, coffee, pepper,
ginger, etc.; (8) ornaments, lace; (9) skins, chamois, morocco, etc.;
(10) handwork, used and new cloths; (11) brandy; (12) crafts: tailoring,
capmaking, furrier, lace-making, embroidery, gold and silver works.
The Jews offered to give up trade in (1) expensive cloth; (2) French
cloth; (3) jewelry, diamonds, watches, credenzas, knives, candle-sticks,
clostly mirrors; (4) Bavarian and English notions, better shoes, silver
prongs, table ware; (5 ) iron: sickles, plough tips;
(6) Armenian wares; (7) wax, costly wines, drugs, crystal glass,
etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jewish proposals elicited a storm in the Cracow
Town Hall, although it was apparent to all that no changes were
involved in the trade relations in the city.  The deliberations dragged
on and they diligently studied the agreements of 1609 and 1615 and
analogous agreements in Lemberg and Posen.  Finally they sent
an agreement to the lawyer in Warsaw.  It was signed by Feistmantel,
Florkowski, Bajer and others.  The agreement set forth that Jews were
permitted to trade with the following wares in Cracow shops
and warehouses, being forbidden, however, to distribute them to courts
of nobles, churches and to the suburbs.  The list included (1) foreign
linens of various kinds (white, striped, cotton, tick, coarse linen,
Silesian, Fustian) to be sold only by the piece and not by the
yard, since there were many stores that bought by the piece and sold
at a profit by the yard; (2) muslins, table cloths, napkins, towels,
(single ones and in sets), linen for painted tapestries (by the piece
and by the yard), linen kerchiefs by the dozen, cotton fleece tapestries
(by the piece and by the yard), linen kerchiefs by the dozen, cotton
fleece nightcaps; (3) cotton goods, chintz, batiste, lace, gauze; (4)
gingham, baize (by the piece and by the yard); (5 ) ordinary cloth,
both smooth or striped and dotted, regular Fustian cloth (by the piece
but not by the yard); (6) Scottish woolens, regular wool and halfwool
(except French and Dutch cloth, which were not to be brought in for
sale), by the piece and not by the yard, various kinds of crepe, by
piece, roll or yard; (7) genuine Brabant lace, lace work which the
Jewish women make, by the piece and by the yard; (8) pins, needles,
pipes, long pipes, thimbles, camels' hair; (9) thread, gut, whips;
(10) rugs, divans, glazed linen, by the piece and by the yard; (11)
heavy blankets, light blankets, army blankets, regular belts, mattresses,
quilts (except embroidered), Turkish gowns, saddles, saddle accessories,
wicks, tallow, Astrakhan short coats and cheaper ones, hats for finishing;
(12) ladies' and men's second-hand clothing, remnants; (13) goods left
in pawn; (14) artistic handwork like hand-made buttons.  There were
also two final points: (1) the cap makers' gild stood on its rights;
(2) the wares must be first inspected in the municipal warehouses and
only thereafter be taken to their own shops and warehouses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This time the magistracy seemed more liberal than
before.  This was due to influence from Warsaw and also of the occupying
power.  But this time too the magistracy sought to retain in its jurisdiction
whatever they could.  They retained almost entirely petty trading in
articles of daily use, excluding thereby a whole series of products
from Jewish trade.  Some gilds, like those of the tailors and capmakers,
did not want to relinquish their historic privileges, even though the
Jewish tailors and capmakers were twice or thrice as numerous as the
gentile artisans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The various proposals were returned to the Assessors
Court for final decision.  At the same time the court also took up
the controversy between the Kazimierz magistracy and the Jews concerning
previous Jewish misdeeds, such as ruining the city brick buildings,
trading with beer of foreign breweries, etc.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kazimierz matter was turned over by the Assessors
Court on November 7, 1770 to the Cracow wojewoda.  But since Rzewuski
was still a prisoner in Moscow nothing was done about it until August
10, 1772, when Kazimierz was in the hands of the Austrians.  Since
this time too the Jews were not able to produce the necessary documents
and since the Polish rule was temporarily in abeyance, the Assessors
Court postponed action until the return of the native government. In
the meantime, however, the occupying power began to consider the
matter in its own way and in the light of its own interests. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">APPENDIX</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF GUTMAN RAKOWSKI MADE
WHILE PRISONER OF THE CONFEDERATES IN LANCKORONA</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(AMK, fasc.  Zydzi V.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Copy of the last will and testament of Gutman
Rakowski, head and <I>parnes </I>of the Jewish community of Kazimierz.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We, the undersigned, do hereby testify that we hear
the words of Gutman Rakowski, of blessed memory, <I>parnes </I>of the
community of Kazimierz, who was imprisoned in Lanckorona during the
Confederation by General Schiuz.  Imprisoned with him was
Yisroel Dawidowicz and they were visited by Lewek Jachimowicz, the
arendator of Czernichow and a goldsmith.  Through the latter,
Gutman's wife sent three shirts to the prison.  Gutman, of sound mind,
made a will in the presence of Lcwek Jachimowicz and Yisroel Dawidowicz
and pronounced it in great sorrow.  The contents of the will was as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Listen my dear good friends!  I am now looking
forward to death.  I cannot endure any more suffering.  I must seal
with my death the severe tortures, the imprisonment and hunger.
I shall never again see my wife and children alive.  Lying all bruised
and sick I wept bitterly that I must suffer unjust death for all the
members of the Kazimierz community.  Please tell my wife that nothing
will be left to her after my death!  What will she do now and how will
she support herself?  I am now a pauper.  Whatever I had in cash or in
gold, which I tried to hide from the Confederate troops, was taken from me.
I was attacked suddenly, robbed of everything and everything in my home
was destroyed or seized.  I was tortured mercilessly and in my bare
shirt I was led to prison through the very city in which I was <I>parnes</I>.
They perpetrated the worst deeds upon me.  They tore up valuable papers,
important bills and notes of various nobles and churches and some from
the leaders of the Confederates too.  These had been given to me for
various goods.  They were taken by force from my shop and they amounted
to 2,000 zlotys or more.  I also had five notes from the deceased Prince
Jordan, the elder of Siedmiochow, for various goods that he had received
from me.  These amounted to about 2,000 zlotys.  That they tore these
up has brought me great grief.  What will my wife and children do without
these notes?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My own brick building I bequeath to no one except to
my son Isaac, who loaned me the sum of 2,000 zlotys for repairs.
The building belongs to no one but him, as it should be.  Counting
profit from that amount for this period would total about 3,000 zlotys
or more.  This son of mine is the nearest relative and the first to
receive the debt owed to him just like the other creditors, for he spent
money for me for various needs and repairs.  In addition to the
above-mentioned sum I also owe a still larger sum, of which I positively
and truthfully here admit.  If anyone finds a signature of the name of
my son with any creditor let it be known that the signature is not
genuine and does not have validity since he did not sign it.  A noble
lord prescribed that I bring some one to vouch for me or else that my
son should sign with me.  Since my son was not in Poland at the time
but abroad and I did not want to reveal this to any one, I brought my
servant and he signed for my son.  My son did not know of this.
It grieves me that now too he is not in Poland and I shall never see
him again.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the above was pronounced before us, the
undersigned, by Gutman Rakowski, of blessed memory, head
and <I>parnes</I> of the community,
while imprisoned by the Confederates in Lanckorona.  He made this will
and read it to us before be died and while of sound mind.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To this we testify in best of faith and attach our
signature, this 18th day of June 1771.</P>
