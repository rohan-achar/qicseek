	The internet has become a very important tool for society.  Its 
importance is of both academic and commercial interests.  This research 
project will focus on the emergence of commercial uses for the web.  
Specific areas that will be addressed will include:  what is available 
now, how accessible are businesses, how electronic transactions will be 
conducted, and finally how on-line 
business advertise that is different than that of regular businesses.
<p>
	To begin with, there are many limiting factors to doing business 
on the internet.  These factors limit how much can actually be conveyed 
over the electronic lines.  For instance, there is the issue of 
accessibility.  Not everyone has a computer or even regular access to one.  
This severely limits the size of your potential customer base.  On the 
other hand this market is rapidly growing.
<p>
	Secondly, if you do have access to a personal computer or access to a
direct internet connection, the capabilities of browsers are limiting
factors as well.  For instance, navigating the world wide web can be
demanding because of the direct link required to run powerful
browsers like Mosaic.  Mosaic provides an excellent interface, however,
access to this program is severely limited.  Even beyond the 
accessibility problem, the
availability of add-on's to browsers are another factor.  Add-on's entitle
the browser to sound or graphic display capabilities.  Any of these add-
ons can change the way in which information is conveyed over the computer
terminal. 
<p>
	Lastly, searching the World Wide Web can be cumbersome.  Until 
recently and the introduction of search engines such as <a 
href="http://www.rpi.edu./~decemj/cmc/mag/1994/sep/spiders.html">Harvest 
and Lycos,</a> 
gathering information was a very tedious task.  These engines will help 
users find information that is valuable and allow people to "surf" the web 
much faster and more efficiently.

<h2>Electronic cash</h2>

With the emergence of making transactions over the network, one form of 
<a href="http://www.digicash.com/ecashinfo/general.html#whatis">"electronic 
cash"</a> <img src="http://www.digicash.com/ecash/shops/_dc.gif"> has  
been created to help facilitate anonymous payments, 
"just as if both parties shared the same room."  Abbreviated as 
<i>ecash</i>, this system was developed by <a 
href="http://www.digicash.com/company/digicash.html">DigiCash Inc.</a>, and 
is a software solution for payment rather than the  
traditional use of money.  Making transactions using ecash can be made 
easily, privately and safely due to advances in <a  
href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?cryptography">cryptography. 
</a>  
<p>
The use of this electronic payment system is considered more 
secure than giving your credit card to a waiter in a restaurant, 
because "electronic cash is digitally 'signed' by the issuer" and 
processed immediately.  
Privacy is an inherent part of the system because unlike paper cash, 
electronic cash is virtually untraceable.  However, users can easily 
prove if they did or did not make a payment, making fraudulent 
activities almost non-existent.  Payment can be made from any computer 
connected to the internet when coupled with the use of a special client  
program. 
<p>
<i>Ecash</i> is a form of currency that is currently being beta 
tested and is very possible of being widely used by many vendors on 
the net because of its advantages.  In order for the ecash system to  
work, 4 parties are needed: 1) an issuing bank that will exchange real  
money for ecash; 2) users who will spend the ecash; 3) vendors who will  
accept ecash as payment for goods and services; and 4) banks that will clear 
payments received from vendors.  
<p>
"Virtual retail stores" such 
as <a href="http://www.digicash.com/digishop/shopmain.html">DigiCash 
Cybershops</a> are already accepting ecash as payment.  For example, 
there's a games shop where you can play simple games like Tic Tac Toe 
online, and if you win, you get ecash back.  <a 
href="http://www.dds.nl/~tsoc/tsoc.html">The Samaritans of Cheltenham and 
District</a> is a charitable organization in the U.K. that accepts real 
money or ecash as donations.
<p> 
With already the existence of "virtual retail stores" like 
the ones located inside <a href="http://virtualmall.com">Virtual Mall,</a>, 
product ordering has not been well established yet, but orders can be 
printed to a printerat the vendor's site, emailing, or appending the order 
to a text file.  For example, when ordering a pizza from <a 
href="http://www.pizzahut.com">Pizza Hut</a>, you provide your name, 
address, and phone number, and if your area (determined from your area 
code) is being serviced, then you will be presented with a menu with 
pull-down fields.  The order will then be emailed to a server, which will 
then be forwarded to the local location.
<p>
An experimental grocery store called <a 
href="http://rainer.bnt.com/htbin/wa">Wane's Online Grocery Store</a> 
allows you to grab a shopping cart and go into different "aisles" where 
you can choose items you want to purchase.  It keeps a running total of 
your purchases.  When you're ready to checkout, just hit the "cash register" 
button, and you can pay for your groceries using ecash.

<h2>Advertising on the net</h2>

With a growing number of net-users, businesses have made 
the move toward targeting the massive market of web 
enthusiasts.  In todays age, people are learning to use the 
web and its resources as a tool to achieve increased 
productivity.  Users are spending more and more of their work 
and spare time on the network.  Thus it only makes sense for 
advertisers to target this population.  
<p>     
     With the advent of the mass media engines, advertisers 
have been able to efficiently target their audience to both 
lower the cost of advertising and to reach the intended 
audience.  Previous to the advent of the net, television, 
newspapers and magazines, and the radio were the general 
mediums for advertisements.  The use of these forums, 
although streamlined in recent years, is somewhat clumsy as 
far as targeting the intended audience.  
<p>     
     For instance, have you ever sat down to eat dinner 
and see a Tampax commercial come on.  Or been in the middle of watching 
a football game and been bombarded with advertisements for toothpaste.   
Where's the connection?   Well, their isn't one.
That's the point.  There is nothing to say that an armchair sports 
analyzer isn't a consumer of toothpaste, in fact he is.  But 
wouldn't it be better to try and appeal to this man's hygiene 
needs in the morning when he's waking up?  Of course it would.  
But that's one of the fundamental problems of television 
advertising.  Target audience.
<p>     
     With net advertising, these problems are simply 
non-existent. If commercials were free, or at least nearly so, 
then there would be no problem with inefficient ads.  The 
company could literally saturate the media with images of their 
product and either people would start buying it, or Congress 
would pass legislation to ban it.  With net advertising, you get 
the best of both worlds.  
<p>     
     Net ads cost virtually nothing to run, and can easily be 
either sent to people linked to the net, or be placed in strategic 
"locations" on the web.  In this manner, companies can reach the 
growing audience of net-surfers and solicit their products.  
Virtual malls also provide an excellent forum for net "browsers" 
to see the wide array of products available through the web.  
<p>     
     In a particular "virtual mall" called <a href="http://virtumall.com"> 
Virtumall</a> users can browse 
through a variety of products, ranging from air freshener to cars to dog 
biscuits.  One particularly interesting shop was the <a 
href="http://virtumall.com/goinggreek/goinggreek.html">Going Greek Store 
</a>that specializes in the sales of clothing that's tailored to campus 
clubs 
and greek letter organizations.  The order form is attractively designed 
with pictures of almost all of the products so you can see exactly what 
is being offered.  
<p>
The cyber mall shopper can enjoy just "walking" through the 
mall, or if they get the urge to buy, there are usually complete order 
forms at the bottom of the advertisement.  This is a form that is similar 
to the Home Shopping Network, however on a more personal and easier level.  
Users of the mall don't 
even have to wait for the product to change on the screen.  They can 
move through the mall freely, switching the type of products 
they view or scroll along among the same types of products to 
find the brand that pleases them. 
<p>     
     Most computer companies have web pages set up to provide 
service and support for the users of their products.  <a 
href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computer's home page</a>
<img src="http://www.apple.com/images/mainheader.gif"> 
is an excellent example of 
this.  Through this format, Apple can display many of their new 
products to users that are obviously interested in them.  Some 
of the formats include: <a 
href="http://www.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/prodspec-pl?/PowerBooks/PowerBook.520c">
showrooms</a> that usually give a picture of the product and a brief sales 
pitch, <a
href="http://www.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister-pl?Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates">
software updates and lists</a>, and quicktime movies .  Consumers can get 
the information on the products they are interested in without sitting  
through general purpose, image boosting commercials that 
really give very little product information.  In this way, users can find 
the information they need quickly and efficiently, which will very likely  
translate into greater future sales and higher customer satisfaction. 
<p>     
     Companies like <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>, advertise a large 
variety of their hardware, and even provide an option to order 
over the net, an invaluable tool for impulsive buyers. 
<p>     
    On our school systems, the sound capabilities are minimal, 
but I'm told that the web is in full multimedia context--
graphics, sound, motion--just like television.  For years, 
advertisers have used appealing graphics and sounds to entice an 
unwary public into purchasing their products.  Now, even the net 
is not exempt from this type of brainwashing.    
<p>     
     Some products that can be used over the computer, such as 
those that are composed entirely of 
graphics, have even more elaborate selling schemes.  For 
some reason or another, there is no way to censor the 
material that goes over the lines, which gives companies 
like <a href="http://www.playboy.com">Playboy</a><img 
src="http://www.playboy.com/images/bunny_square.gif">, a 
brilliant way to advertise their products.  By giving <a 
href="http://www.playboy.com/playmates/playmate-dec94.html">"samples"</a> 
over the internet, the viewer is baited to the product.  Furthermore, 
such an interface allows the user to be interactive and actually 
participate in many aspects of the magazine, including submitting 
articles and giving comments to the publisher.
<p>
     There are many ways that advertisers are using and will use 
the web in the future to make products both more available 
and desirable to consumers, but they are far too numerous to 
go into detail ere.  In short, the web is a 
powerful business tool as well as a source of information and 
entertainment.  Just as the television is able to bring us shows via 
advertising funds, perhaps the same will soon be true for 
the net.  Maybe in the future, advertising will pay for our 
entertainment as well as our research.
