<td width ="80%">
My goal in ICS-31 is for students to begin learning the general principles of
  programming: how to specify, design, code, document, test, debug, evaluate,
  and maintain computer software.
To make these principles concrete, we will explore them by studying and using
  the Python programming language.
This course assumes no prior programming experience, so it will carefully
  explain everything that students need to know to understand programming; but,
  it will move at a quick pace, so be prepared to work hard and struggle a bit
  with the material.
Also, the material we cover needs to be understood so ti can be applied in
  novel situations, not just memorized.
<p>
The intellectual content of this course can be neatly divided into three 
  main subject areas: Algorithmics, Abstraction, and Analysis (the triple-As):
  <ul>
    <li>Algorithmics: tokens, simple types, literals, names/variables, objects,
          expressions, exceptions, and control structures.
    <li>Abstraction: functions, compound types (strings, lists, sets, maps,
           ... classes), methods, modules.
    <li>Analysis: equivalence, pragmatics, aesthetics (style), correctness
          (testing/debugging), efficiency (big-O notation), and numerical
          accuracy.
   </ul>  
<p>
The main programming methodology that we will learn and employ is
   iterative-enhancement, which decomposes a large project into a series of
   mini-projects (each is called a phase).
Starting from a kernel, and writing a program for each of these phases in
   sequence, results in a solution to the original project.
Each phase requires repeatedly specifying, designing, coding, documenting,
   testing, debugging, and evaluating a testable program (or new or enhanced
   function to use in the program) that is a small extension of the
  capabilities of the program (or function) produced in the previous phase.
<p>
Here is a quick overview of the the three programming class in UCI's three
  quarter Introduction to Programming sequence.
All are taught in Python, and the combined time-on-task studying and
  programming with this language should make students proficient in using it.
<ol>
<li>ICS-31: Introduction to Programming.
    This course introduces the basics of the Python programming language and
      how to develop programs in an Integrated Development Environment
      using Python.
<li>ICS-32: Programming With Software Libraries.
    This course increases students' abilities to write more complicated
      programs; it focuses on students learning how to read, understand, and
      employ modules from Python's library.
<li>ICS-33: Intermediate Programming.
    This course examines Python more carefully, giving students a more unified
      look at the language and discussing some of its powerful features that
      make sophisticated programming easier.
    It also covers some programming related Computer Science topics.
</ol>
A quick way to analogize these courses is: 31: learning to drive; 32: road
  trips; 33: car mechanics.
<p>
Although we will mostly study <i>programming-in-the-small</i>, we will
  concentrate on the technical and lingual issues of building large,
  reliable programmed systems that are constructed from standard components.
Expect to cover most relevant Python language features thoroughly, but also
  to spend much time discussing the less concrete -but ultimately more
  general and important- aspects of programming.
Programming style is a particularly important topic: to understand
  programming, we really need to develop appropriate aesthetics that allow
  us to separate "elegant" programs from "hacks".
As in any writing activity, we must also learn to be self-critical of our own
  creations, so that we can continually improve them; this skill is difficult
  to acquire, and its importance extends well beyond the domain of
  programming.
<p>
Finally, to become an expert in any discipline, we must master its
   terminology.
Fluency with technical terms allows us to communicate -and even to think-
   more accurately and concisely.
Therefore, the materials in this course will define, illustrate, and
   repeatedly use many important technical terms concerning programming.
Take the time required to master them. An old Chinese proverb says,
     "The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names."

There is no required textbook for this course.
The primary sources for ICS-31 will come from materials that I have
  written (and am continually updating).
These materials include readings, problem sets, quizzes, and programming
  assignments (and a bunch of infrastructure material, like this syllabus).
Typically, these materaisl will be shorter than chapters in a textbook, but
  they are more densely packed with information; thus, you will still spend
  about the same amount of time studying my web pages as you would reading a
  textbook.
<p>
Recently ICS-31 and ICS-32 classes taught by other instructors have used the
  following book: <b>Perkovic</b>, <i>Introduction to Computing Using Python: An
  Application Development Focus</i>, Wiley, 2011.
Copies should be available at the bookstore or online at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computing-Using-Python-Application/dp/0470618469/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1363875463&sr=8-1&keywords=perkovic">
Amazon</a>,
<p>
I have used the following books in the more advanced Python classes I have
  taught.
They are difficult reading for a beginner, but the more you learn about Python
  the easier it is to read these books.
<ol>
<li><b>Lutz</b>, <i>Learning Python (Fourth Edition)</i>, O'Reilly, 2011.
Copies should be available at the bookstore or online at

<li><b>Lutz</b>, <i>Programming Python</i>, O'Reilly, 2009.
Copies should be available at the bookstore or online at

Amazon</a>,
</ol>
These books are <!-also-> available new and used on the internet.
See <a href="http://www.directtextbook.com/" target="_blank">
  DirectTextbook</a>, which crawls the web for cheap prices.
Don't forget to account for shipping costs and delivery time if you don't
  buy from the UCI bookstore.
<p>
Finally, there are many Python resources on the internet.
One goal of this class is to get you closer towards being able to find and
  use relevant online information based on questions you have about Python.

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Computing Platforms and Programming Environments</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The standard computing platforms for this course are
  <ul>
    <li>PCs running the Windows (7 or similar) Operating System (OS).
    <li>Macintosh PCs running the OS X operating system
    <li>Either PC running Linux.
  </ul>
<p>
We expect that ICS-31 students will use their own computers to complete their
  programming assignments (sometimes working in groups of two: pair
  programming).
All the software used in ICS-31 is available, for free, on the web.
<p>
The programming environment that we will use is Eclipse: it is an Integrated
  Development Environment (IDE),  including a project manager, editor,
  interpreter, and debugger.
We will write all our programs in the Python programming language.
To run Eclipse with Python, you must first install Java (to run Eclipse) and
  Python, and then Eclipse itself.
This software, and others useful for the course, are available through the
  <a href="../../../common/online.html">Course Software</a>
  link (see the heading <b>Main Software</b>, near the top).
You should try to follow these instructions, and download and install this
  software yourself; if you are having difficulty, please bring your computer
  to lab and ask our staff to help you with the installation.
<p>
Typically it takes only a few days before everyone has correctly downloaded and
  installed the necessary software, and has started to learn how to use it
  properly.
Using this software is integral to every programming assignment during the
  quarter, so it is best to be aggressive and download, install, and start
  mastering this software quickly.

We expect students to do much (but not all) of their programming assignments
  during their labs, which are scheduled for 4 hours per week.
These labs are staffed by TAs and Lab Tutors.
I encourage all students to ask them questions on a regular basis and generally
  engage them in a dialog about programming: learning to talk about programming
  is an explicit goal of this course.
<p>
While most students will do their coursework in labs on their own machines,
  the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab">ICS Labs</a> also provide machines
  with the correct software loaded.
You should follow these
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php">
  Activation Instructions</a> for your ICS Lab Account early in the quarter.
Whether or not you plan on doing your homework in a lab, you must activate your
  ICS account and know how to use it for in-lab programming exams.
<p>
During in-lab programming exams, you must write your programs on the PCs in our
  labs, so you should learn to use these machines, even if you use your own
  machine for all other coursework.
Once you start Eclipse, what computer you are on makes little difference:
   PCs, Macs, and Linux systems operate similarly.
<p>
Although the machines in the ICS labs also provide some external storage space
  (the <b>H</b> drive on a Unix system), it is an excellent idea to backup your
  work either electronically or using USB memory, whether you are using your
  own computer or the computers in our lab.
<p>
Finally, the <b>ICS 364</b> lab is a general purpose lab in which no courses
  are scheduled.
It is open to students on weekdays and weekends:
   MTuWThT 8:00am - 10:00pm,
   F 8:00am - 8:00pm,
   and SaSu 12:00noon - 6:00pm.

I welcome students, individually or in small groups, to come by and talk with
  me during my Office Hours.
If we need to talk, but you cannot come during my office hours, please email
  me so that we can arrange an alternative time to meet; or better yet, maybe
  we even can resolve the entire issue over email (or using the Message Forums,
  discussed below, where other students can benefit from questions and answers).
<p>
I will be glad to talk with you about any of the ICS-31/-32/-33 courses, 
   Computer Science, UCI, or whatever else you want to discuss.
Although UCI is a large school, ICS is a smaller school within it, and ICS
  promotes opportunities for close faculty-student interaction, especially
  with instructors who are lecturers.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, not enough students take advantage of this
  opportunity at UCI.
<p>
I especially encourage students who are having problems in the course to visit
  me immediately; I know that this is asking a lot, but the payoff for
  recognizing the situation and acting on it immediately is tremendous.
The primary reason that students fail to thrive in programming courses is that
  they fall behind in their work -often because of what is initially a small
  misunderstanding; but, because of the cumulative nature of this course,
  even a small misunderstanding can quickly grow into a big one.
Often, I can quickly diagnose and rectify such a problem one-on-one.
Getting help fast can critically affect your overall performance in
  this course: many times I've seen students start performing one grade
  level higher after coming in to get help during my office hours.
<p>
Unfortunately, I teach ~400 students during a typical quarter, so my time is
  a bit limited.
But please come visit if you need help so we can try to work things out.
Of course, you can also talk to your TA and Lab Tutors during your labs, where
  resources and time are not so tight.

If you have a small question (one requiring little back-and-forth discussion),
  and cannot directly contact me or any of staff, please ask it by sending me
  email (<a href="mailto:pattis@ics.uci.edu">pattis@ics.uci.edu</a>).
It has been my experience that the act of writing a detailed description of a
  problem (detailed enough so that someone not physically present can
  understand it) often leads a student to his/her own solution of the problem.
Frequently, before I even get a chance to read my email, I receive a second
  message saying,  "Please ignore my earlier message, I solved the problem
   myself."
I believe that the seeds of the solution are sown in the act of carefully
  composing the first email message.
Here is quote on my website about this phenomenon.
<p>
<table width ="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="1" rules="all">
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
Another effective [debugging] technique is to explain your code to someone
  else.
This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself.
Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed
  "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you."
This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.
One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.
Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before
  they could speak to a human counselor. 
<p align="right"><i>- B. Kernighan & D. Pike
  (in "The Practice of Programming" pp. 123)</i></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Talking about programming is important.
One of the reasons that we program in pairs is to always have someone who you
  can to talk to about your code; unlike the teddy bear, someone who has an
  interest in getting your code to work, and who might supply relevant feedback.
<p>
I try to answer email every few hours during the day.
I normally will not answer email sent after about 10:00pm until early the next
  morning (but I'll typically answer it by the next morning).
If you have problems late at night that you cannot resolve, please send me
  email (or post on the relevant forum) summarizing your problems, and then go
  to work on something else (or if it is really late, go to sleep).
By planning to finish assignments early, you can protect yourself against a big
  problem that arises at night and cannot be fixed until the next day: you
  really don't want to have to fix such a problem the night that an assignment
  is due.
<p>
For most problems -ones that are of general interest to the class- I would
  prefer that you ask the question using a MessageBoard forum (see below).
In this way, everyone in the class can see the question and its answer
  (which I might provide, or a a TA/Lab Tutor, or another student).
One of the few advantages of a big class is having lots of student activity on
  such forums, leading to peer-instruction.
<p>
Finally, the Electronic Educational Environment (EEE) at UCI creates and
  maintains course-wide mailing lists.
I have created a "merged" mailing list for all my ICS-31 students (which also
  includes those students signed up for CSE 41, both in the Sammueli School of
  Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science).
All members of our course (staff and students) can use this mailing list, whose
  email address is <b>ics31-S13@classes.uci.edu</b>
All messages sent via this discussion list are archived: click
  <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/s13/36540/" target="main">
    here</a> or see the <b>Email Archive</b> link on the course website.
Mostly student-initiated questions/discussions should use the forums mentioned
  below, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the
  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g., the
  Checkmate Homework Dropoff system not responding to program submissions.

<p>
If you have a question of general interest (of interest to many students in the
  course, not just you), then you should post the question on one of the
  <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m13828//?quarter=S13" target="main">Forums</a> on the EEE MessageBoard.
These forums allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as
  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).
For example, if a lecture note, programming assignment, etc. contains unclear
  (or even contradictory) information, post a note about it to the appropriate
  forum, asking for a clarification.
I, or someone from my staff will read and reply to whatever questions are
  asked.
In fact, if you read a question on a forum, and know the answer -or generally
  have something to contribute to the topic- I encourage you to to post a reply
  to help resolve the problem even sooner.
Thus, you can use the forums to discuss any course materials out-of-class.
<p>
Again, forums are appropriate for questions relevant to most students in the
  course; directly email me (see above) for questions of a more
  individualistic nature.
Obviously students should not use these forums to solicit nor post answers to
  take-home quizzes, programming assignments, or anything else that would be
  interpreted as academic misconduct (which is discussed in greater detail
  below).
But general informational questions and answers are fine.
I often find that students send me individual email when they should be
  posting on a forum; think before you decide which to do.
<p>
It is an excellent idea to check these forums frequently, to keep up to date
  on any coursewide discussions.

You can certainly discuss programming and Python in general with these staff

TAs will also be responsible for grading programming assignments; if you have

TAs will also grade the weekly quizzes.
<p>
While in lab, the TAs and Tutors will help you diagnose any
  computer/programming problems that you have and guide you toward a solution.
They will help you learn how to program by answering your questions; but, do
  not expect them to write your programs for you.
You should approach them with a well thought-out question, and expect to answer
  questions from them about your state of understanding the issues surrounding
  the question.
Sometimes when you come to the staff with a specific question, they will show

I expect students to read the assigned lecture materials, either before class
  (as a way to preview the lecture) or after class (where the lecture previews
  the reading), to get the most out of both: cover the material twice.
Try to work out solutions to the assigned problems, to prove that you have
  understood the material; you can often test/verify/explore your solutions on
  the computer.
Here <b>understanding</b> means "be able to use the information operationally
  to write programs".
If you have difficulty with a problem, it indicates that you should probably
  go back over the related reading -or certainly ask a question about it on the
  Forum.
One of the few advantages of a big class like this is the potental for
   peer-teaching.
<p>
Because these problems are not graded, feel free to discuss them, but don't
  give away the answers for those still working on them: working on exercises

I expect students to attend class daily.
During the 35+ years that I have been teaching, I have observed a strong
  correlation between attending class and understanding the material (which 
  ultimately improves student grades).
Having all the course materials online is a great resource, but just as
  important is coming to class -and paying attention, once you are there-
  and participating by volunteering information when you know it and asking
  questions when you are confused.
<p>
I will lecture during class, but I prefer discussing the material and answering
  questions; asking you questions about the material, and amplifying on those
  topics that need further discussion.
I expect most "lectures" to be interactive, with students participating.
<p>
I encourage you to participate by raising your hand; sometimes I may finish
  the point I'm making before calling on you, but please keep your hand up if
  you want to speak.
If you have a question about the material, it typically means that I have
  explained something incorrectly, poorly, or incompletely, and that other
  students have (or will soon have, maybe right after they leave the classroom)
  the same question.
So, it would be best for all of us to correct the problem immediately in class
  by someone bringing it to my attention.
If you cannot ask in class, post a question later on a MessageBoard Forum.
In summary, this class runs on the Dershowitz principle:
  "Question authority; but raise your hand first".

These quizzes will be a take-home instrument: most will be distributed at the
  end of class on Friday and collected at the start of class on the following
  Monday.
During the weekend, you will have as much time as you need to work on the
  quizzes.
<p>
The quizzes are open-book: you will be able to use any class materials, or any
  other materials from the web, to answer its questions.
But, you may not communicate with anyone about these quizzes nor their
  solutions; nor should you search for/look at solutions to these specific
  problems on the web. 
The quizzes are also open-computer: by that I mean that you may use a computer
  to check your work.

<td width ="80%">
I will assign six full programming assignments (and two shorter ones) to ensure
  that everyone is getting the necessary hands-on programming experience.
While working on these programs, you will acquire a solid and fine-tuned
  understanding of the course material as well as gain important
  <i>process of programming</i> skills.
Programs will typically be discussed and started in Lab on Thursdays, and be
  due (submitted electronically) the following Thursday evening at 11:30pm
  (typically 1 week after they are assigned; but Program #0 and #2 are shorter).
<p>
Students will often be required to work in groups of two on programming
  assignments.
Such an approach is called
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html" target ="_top">
  Pair Programming</a>.
On student from each pair submit all parts of the programming assignment
  with both their names on it (in the code files).
Apart from your pair, you can get <b>general</b> help from anyone (Instructor,
  TA, Lab Tutors, friends, etc.) on programs.
But, the best kind of help to get is oral: where you describe the problem,
  possibly showing your code briefly, and then get an oral answer that you
  understand and translate into code.
In such instances, you are learning. 
<p>
<b>You may neither copy nor transcribe (written or orally) any parts of another
    student's program, nor have another student sit down and systematically
    correct your program.</b> 
<p>
When you submit your programs for grading, you are expected to understand all
  parts of them and have improved your <i>process of programming</i> skills
  while writing and debugging them.
Students who complete their programs in this way will be well prepared for
  the In-Lab Programming Exams; students who get too much help (on purpose,
  or accidentally) from their programming partners or others will have a more
   difficult time on these exams, which can severely impact their grade.    
<p>
You will submit your solutions to programming assignments through Checkmate, 
  special softare that records the time they are submitted.
You can resbumit your programs as many times as you want.
We will grade only the final submission.
You can read about
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/checkmate/index.html" target ="main">
  Submitting Homework using Checkmate</a> and practice using it in Program #0.
<p>
To promote good time management skills, if you submit a program at least 24
  hours  before it is due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.
If you submit a program 48 hours early, you will receive 2 points.
You can gain no more than 2 points of extra credit by early submission.
For a 45 point assignment, this extra credit is equivalent to almost half a
  letter grade improvement.
In general, it is a bad idea to submit programs more than 48 hours early
  (typically we will return graded programs on Monday, and you should wait to
  receive them and see how they are grades before submitting your new program).
<p>
I know from long teaching experience that students who work ahead of the
  deadlines learn more, in a less stressed envrionment: students working right
  up to a deadline are more concerned with getting the right answer and less
  concerned with learning anything.
On the other side of this coin, I will not accept any late programs.
So, you must turn in your work on time: if you turn in a partially working
  program on time, it will receive partial credit; if you do not turn in
  anything on time, then I must assume you did no work on the program, and you
  will receive no credit.
Therefore, always turn in whatever work you have finished by the official due
  time.

Its problems will be similar to those assigned on homework, and especially on

These written exams are closed-book: you will not be able use any notes nor

The best way to study for these exams is to do all the homework and quizzes

Cramming will be of little help: we will cover too much material during
  the quarter.
Students are expected to be able to do these problems both quickly and

Of course, you will have to know lots of general material about programming

  Eclipse IDE).
<p>
The programming exams themselves will be closed-book; but, you will be able

<p>
If you believe that I have graded any of your work incorrectly, I encourage you
  to see me immediately about the discrepancy (in the case of programming
  assignments, see your TA first).
Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either I will agree with you
 that you deserve more credit (and, I do want you to receive all the credit
 that you are due), or you will come to understand the question, program, or
  solution better.
This is certainly a win-win situation.
In any case, carefully examine my solution before you come to see me.

This is straight calculation, not based on a curve.
I tend to grade programming assignments liberally, but quizzes,
  written/programming exams conservatively.
As a rule of thumb, I expect about 25% of the student to earn As, about 25% to
  earn Bs, about 25% to earn Cs, and about 25% to earn Ds or Fs.
This course is NOT graded on a curve, so these are only expectations from
  past course performance, not mandated numbers; your numbers can 
  be higher or lower.
<!---
FYI: for the Spring 07 quarter, the actual breakdown was: 27% As, 24% Bs, 25%
  Cs, 13 Ds, and 11 % Fs.
--->
<p>
After finishing 4 quizzes, 3 programming assignments, the midterm, and the
  one in-class programming exam, you have a reasonable indication of your
  final course grade (which, of course, will still heavily depend on the
  grades you earn afterward).

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><a name="Policy"><b>Policy</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The decision as to whether a student has cheated depends on the intent of an
  assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of
  the student. 
The following two guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has
   occurred on programming, which is the fuzziest area:
<ul>
  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent
         development and implementation of a program results in two or more 
         solutions so similar that one solution can be converted to the
         other(s) by a series of simple transformations.
  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if a student who completed an assignment 
         cannot explain both the intricacies of the solution and 
         the techniques used to generate that solution.
</ul>
It is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating that would cover
  all cases, because each situation is important enough to merit careful,
  individual scrutiny; however, it is helpful to have guidelines and
   precedents.
<p>
Here are some examples that are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating.
<p>
<b>Examples of CHEATING</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own (with or
        without his/her knowledge), without it including a statement of
        collaboration in the solution.
  <li>Allowing another student to turn in your work, in whole or in part, as
        his/her own, without it including a statement of collaboration in the
        solution.
  <li>Turning in a completely duplicated assignment.
      Even if all the comments are changed, all the variables names are
        changed, all the whitespace is changed, and the code appears in a
        different order: it is still the same program.
  <li>Several students/pairs writing one assignment and turning in multiple
        copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as an individual
        student's/pair's work, without it including a statement of
        collaboration in the solution.
  <li>After receiving graded written work, returning written work, for
        regrading, which has been altered.
  <li>Finding a solution to the same problem on the web and submitting it
        without explicit attribution in the solution.
  <li>Stealing an examination or solution from the instructor.
</ul>
Generally, you should NOT EXAMINE, by reading hardcopy or by copying a file,
  the program of any other student (nor should you let anyone examine or make
  a copy of your files).
Doing so can easily lead to an intended or unintended academic violation.
<p>
If you ever feel that after talking to someone about a program, which is legal,
  your solution will be very similar to theirs, cite the consultation in the
  header comment in your program.
Doing so protects you from University disciplinary action (although the
  instructor is free to grade the material as he/she sees fit).
<p>
<b>Examples of NOT CHEATING</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course's staff.
  <li>Submitting one assignment for a group of students if group work is 
        explicitly permitted (or required, as in pair-programming).
  <li>Getting or giving help about using the computers.
  <li>Getting or giving help about solving syntax errors.
  <li>High level discussions of course material to better understand them.
  <li>Discussing assignments to better understand them.
</ul>
Again, the key here is not studying, verbatim, someone else's code, and then
  reproducing it as your own work.
It is too easy to copy such code without really understanding it.
Technically, for programming assignments, even understanding the resulting code
  is not enough (if someone else wrote it): you should also play an active role
  in synthesizing and debugging it.
The course is as much about skills as about knowledge.

<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><a name="AutomaticDetection"><b>Automatic Detection of Cheating</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Recently, various cheating-detection software systems have become widely
  available.
Some use search engines to compare selected portions of submitted papers to
  content on the web.
In the context of programming, they compare each student's program to those
  submitted by his/her classmates (for this quarter, and any previous
  quarters if the assignment has been repeated).
This software does not compare programs exactly: it ignores format changes,
  variable name changes, and a variety of well-know transformations that
  change the look of code but not its underlying logic.
<p>
Many courses in ICS use this software to spot potential cheating cases.
Once it identifies suspicious behavior, instructors carefully examine the
  flagged code to make a final determination as to whether students will be
  prosecuted for cheating.
Often instructors can find additional evidence of cheating, once this
  software points them to the simlar code.

ICS will not condone cheating by students in its classes.
When cheating is suspected, instructors will take reasonable action to
  establish whether or not it has actually occurred.
If, in the instructor's opinion it has, the instructor will apply appropriate
  disciplinary policy.
In my courses, for a typical case of cheating, the student will be awarded
  negative credit for the assignment (under the precept that not doing an
  assignment, and receiving no points, is better than cheating on it).
For particular egregious forms of cheating (e.g., cheating on exams, stealing
  another student's work so he/she cannot submit it for credit), harsher
  consequences may apply (from loss of a full letter grade, through immediate
  failure of the course, up through suspension or expulsion from UCI).
<p>
Instructors must contact the student shortly after investigating evidence of
  academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work.
Notice of any action taken by an instructor will also be forwarded to the
  Associate Dean of Student Affairs (ADSA) in ICS, the ADSA of the student's
  home school (if different).
These offices act as a repository for such information, in case the student
  commits multiple infractions.
While the first infraction often results in just a grading penalty, a second
  infraction often results in suspension for one or more quarters.

<td width ="80%">
Cheating undermines the fabric of education.
The atmosphere at UCI (contrary to whatever opinions, prejudices, or
  superstitions you hold) is one of fostering cooperation between faculty and
  students in the pursuit of learning, knowledge, and wisdom.
This course, for example, is graded on an absolute scale, not a curve;
  so, helping other students doesn't affect your grade.
And, if a student cheats for a higher grade, other students do not receive
  lower grades as a result.
<p>
Although it is embarrassing to fail an assignment, getting caught cheating is
  much worse (and some students get caught cheating for very few points).
I know, though, that students rarely think about getting caught.
But think about it: I often see students break down and cry when they get
  caught cheating and only then start to realize the consequences of their
  actions.
Their stress level goes through the roof and it immediately affects both the
  academic and social aspects of their lives.
The process is distressing for me too, although I must confess that I have been
  hardened by the number of times that I have had to go through it (typically
  multiple times each quarter).
Pursuing these cases at the University level takes a lot of my time, and
  reduces the time that I can spend on more important matters relating to my
  course and my students.
It is definitely a lose-lose situation.
<p>
The #1 excuse that I hear for cheating is, "I was pressed for time, so I
  cheated."
By carefully managing your time, you can avoid this problem.
If you start working early enough, and run into problems (and you should expect
  to run into problems), you will have time for the course staff to help you
  learn to solve them.
Also, I understand that some students take this course only because it is a
  requirement for their major, and that they have little intrinsic interest in
  the subject area; this is not a valid excuse for cheating either.
<p>
I have seen too many instances recently where student A asks a friend, student
  B, for help; specifically, A asks to see B's quiz or code (on paper or in a
  computer file).
Often, A copies B's code (with or without B's knowledge).
I understand that B feels pressure to give A help.
But, B is doing A no favor if A's cheating is discovered; B has made a bad 
 situation (A would receive no credit) worse (A receives negative credit and is
  reported to the Dean of Student Affairs).
And, according to UCI's rules, B is violating the Academic Integrity policy
  by these actions too.
I have seen friendships shattered because A copies B's code without telling B
  what was done, and then both get prosecuted under UCI's rules.
<p>
A similar situation arises with cheating on quiz questions.
I have seen too many students cheat on one question on a quiz and receive a
  negative score for the whole quiz (and letter to the Dean of Student
  Student Affairs), when leaving the question blank would result in a small
  point deduction and no university action.
<p>
In my final statement here, I ask you to pause and reflect on the consequences
  of choosing to cheat at UCI: this includes the impacts that it will have on
  you, your parents, your siblings, your friends, and your fellow classmates
  at UCI.
Cheating is invariably the wrong decision.
