<H2>I. INTRODUCTION</H2>

	<P>The arrival of massive on-line computer networks of information 
exchange such as the Internet has given rise to a whole range of unique issues and controversies 
related to privacy, censorship, and the law. For instance, difficulties in 
maintaining privacy has led to a restructuring in the means by which 
governmental bodies collect data on their citizens, one of 
the most notable cases perpetuated by the FBI. This in turn has generated 
concern and resistance over the extent in which government surveillance 
and intrusion on the Internet is 
possible and/or advisable.  Also, while attempts to censor have tended 
to center around topics related to sex, pornography, and sexuality (which are 
all subjects  which classically fall under the legal guise of "obscene"), the 
implementation of censorship and regulatory laws governing content could 
conceivably spread to the extent that they jeopardize free speech and access 
across the board. Simultaneously, 
the Internet has proven an especially difficult and/or problematic format on 
which to implement censorship laws. While computer networks have managed to 
remain relatively open and resistant to attempts at regulation, the drastic 
increase in the use of such information retrieving, accessing, and relaying 
tools such as the World Wide Web virtually ensures that these issues will 
increase in the forseeable future(not to mention the issues related to the 
Web's use of detailed graphics and images). </P>
	<P>The on-line community certainly has not reacted 
passively to attempts at regulation and surveillance. Groups, such as the 
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</A> and the 
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/CAF/">Computers and Academic Freedom 
Archive</A>, have popped up to monitor attempts at regulation, taking a 
decidedly "civil liberties" stance against any form of infringements upon 
open and free speech. In addition, newly emergent issues never cease to pop up, including 
the current bill in the US Congress (<A 
HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-bill.html>Senate Bill 
S314</A>). How these 
issues are resolved and at what cost guarantees to be some of the most 
recurrent and hotly debated topics around as 
we increasingly come to 
depend on the computer information networks as a primary source of information retrieval 
dissemination.</P>

	 
<H2> II. PRIVACY AND THE LAW</H2>

<P>Electronic information exchange raises new issues related to the 
privacy of such transmissions. The ever burgeoning spector of information 
technologies raises grave concerns over the ability of governmental 
agencies to gather unwarranted information on its citizens. Governments have 
any number of justifications for the collection of data on its citizens, 
including census taking, taxation, law enforcement, national service 
programs, etc. That such justifications could easily be bended to serve 
more or destructive purposes hardly needs mention (a brief review of 
the <A HREF="http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/FBI_homepage.html">FBI</A>'s 
history of covert intelligence activities would lay testament to this). 
Thus 
the question becomes, to what extent should governmental access to 
personal information on the Internet be allowed? What 
measures/precations need be taken to deter abusive governmental intrusion of 
the on-line community?</P>
<P>The increasing computerization of public records and databases adds an entirely new element to these debates. For 
example, the ever advanced technology available to the public also 
implies that government bodies have ever advancing ways of collecting 
data and covert means of accessing it. One example is the proposals for 
"smart highways" which enable the constant tracking of all automobiles on 
the road. Given examples like these, concern over surveillance are 
fairly obvious.</P>                              
<P>Laws regarding privacy and surveillance on computerized networks such 
as the Internet vary extensively across states and among service 
providers. There have been some 
fairly limited attempts at passing federal laws which protect personal 
information on computer networks, 
including the Privacy Act of 1974, but these are outdated and lack in 
uniform clarity as to percisely what they protect. Additionally, current 
law is not tailored to 
the unique dynamics involved in the massive informational interchange 
inherent to a system like the Internet. Possibly the most evident 
concern is with the use of <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Privacy/privacy_anonymity.faq">electronic 
mail devises</A> and on-line chat 
services such as <A HREF="http://thales.nmia.com/irc.html">IRC</A>. 
Anonymity in such exchanges is far from assured, 
and current law makes little provisions toward thwarting 
vulnerability to surveillance. 
<P> Rather than curb surveillance capabilities, a powerful attempt recently 
arose that aimed at greatly  
abating government surveillance. In 1992 the FBI attempted to 
implement the <A 
HREF="http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/communications/wiretap/coalition_paper.txt"> 
"Digital 
Telephony" legislation</A>. This was a response by the FBI and other law 
enforcement agencies to a concern that changes in telecommunications 
technology would jeopardize their ability to conduct "authorized 
wiretapping". The proposal mandated that all providers of 
electronic communications services provide law enforcement officials the 
"capability and capacity" to survey and intercept on-line transmissions, 
without 
the detection of the user. This is essentially an attempt to modernize 
the <A 
HREF="http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/communications/wiretap/electronic_commun_privacy_act.txt">wiretap 
statues</A> passed in 1968 and 1986 by Congress. The danger in 
such proposals is in  instilling arcane monitoring techniques to 
the dynamically open and constantly evolving Internet. In addition to its 
oppressively broad scope, the legislation had provisions that would have 
allowed law enforcement agencies to force providers to use certain 
technologies that are of most use to their data collecting purposes. In 
this 
sense then, the law would go far beyond the provisions set out by the 
wiretap laws already in existence by actually <i>requiring</i> providers 
to adopt a certain standard of tools. The wire-tap 
bill unleashed a <A HREF="http://www.cpsr.org/dox/wiretap.html">torrent 
of responses</A>  within the on-line community, as many objected to the 
negative ramifications such a broadly scoped surveillance bill would 
inflict. Nevertheless, on October 7, 1994, the bill finally
passed Congress,  but in a much modified form. The final draft, entitled 
the <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Legislation/Bills_by_name/Old/digital_telephony_94_passage_statement.eff">Edwards/Leahy 
Digital Telephony Legislation</A>  does place functional 
design requirements on providers but does not allow for heightened 
authority to conduct wiretapping operations.</P>

<H2>III. CENSORSHIP, ACCESS, AND THE LAW</H2>
<P> Whereas the concern for the on-line community regarding privacy 
issues has revolved around <i>protection from</i> undo governmental 
intrusion, a related though distinct issue of free and open <i>access to</i> 
informational services has surrounded the issue of censorship on the 
Internet. The Internet has proven particularly resistant to attempts at 
regulating its contents, due in part to the "ethos" of its users 
who tend to regard free and open access at upmost importance(an 
interesting editorial on <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher.uiuc.edu/0R0-6427-/UI/DI/1994/November/18/fabricol.txt">limiting 
Internet freedom</A> addresses this point at length). Probably more 
telling however is the difficulty in actually banning materials from it. 
The Internet is one of the most easily accessible and exploitable
information forums in existence. The advent of the <A 
HREF="http://www.psych.indiana.edu/www.html">World Wide Web</A> 
makes putting information on the Net all the easier, and thus all the 
more resistant to attempts at regulation.</P>
<P> Probably the most recurrent issue related to censorship both on the Net 
and in general is <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/CAF/cafuiuc.html#Suppression">topics 
involving sex</A>. 
One of the most controversial of the sex related  sources on the Internet is a 
newsgroup 
named "alt.sex". This newsgroup carries an extensive array of erotic 
essays, 
sexually explicit stories, sex related discussion groups, and
issues of 
sexuality in general. By far the most targeted for censorship out of 
these is stories which 
describe in often lurid and graphic detail tales of sexual violence, 
degradation of women, 
and even explicit depictions of rape and other forms of forced and/or 
coerced sex. To exasperate the tension arisen by such material even 
further, the World Wide Web's multimedia 
capabilities allows users to pull up pornographic pictures in full 
color. 
These means that virtually anyone old enough to understand how to operate a Web 
browser can have access to such material. It quickly becomes apparent that 
the safeguards to exposure to 
pornographic material available at a store (age of purchase laws) are no 
longer applicable in this new format.</P>
  
<P>In addition, concern has increased over a number of issues relating to 
various debates over the distinction between the terms <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/CAF/faq/censorship-and-harassment.html">"offensive and 
harrassment"</A>. Generally, merely <i>offensive</i> material is 
protected under free speech, whereas <i>harrassment</i> constitutes a 
hate crime punishable by law. Where one draws the line between these 
two is a constant source of ambiguity. Likewise, debate over what falls 
under such laws as 
the UW Rule banning discriminatory speech (or "hate speech") from 
academic settings have been increased. For example, should University 
officials take punitive action upon repeatedly racist jokes and/or 
stories over their computer networks? Given that practically anyone can post 
anything they want on 
the Net, (thereby eliminating safeguards on validity of claims, speech 
codes, etc.) should there be greater attention paid to limiting access 
and/or ban certain types of transmissions above and beyond current 
censorship law?</P>
<P> So far, policies regarding "suppression and expression" vary among service 
providers, but in all are fairly limited. The hesitance at implementing 
regulatory laws to govern network transmission is reflective of the difficulty 
in both deciding what constitutes material to be censored and how to go about 
it in an environment such as the Internet. Attempts at controlling 
transmissions have been fairly unsuccessful, and come at the risk of academic 
openness and the free access so many Net users have come to value. This is not 
to say censorship is unheard of on the Internet, as a quick look at a document 
which lists <A HREF="ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/banned.1992">banned materials in 
1992</A> at major academic institutions bears out.</P>
<P> Possibly the most comprehensive attempt to impose a regulatory measure on 
material on the Internet is a current proposal under consideration in the U.S. 
Congress, the <A HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-bill.html">Senate 
Bill S. 314</A>. This bill, introduced by Senators Exon and Gorton, 
attempts to 
impose current FCC regulations(which govern radio and television 
programming and 
content) regarding "obscene and indecent" material to all networked electronic 
communication outlets. Entitled the "Communications Decency Act of 1995", 
if passed the 
act would incur criminal penalty to providers who allowed such 
material to appear on their network. Thus, the bill would require service 
providers to screen nearly all of the transmissions occurring on their 
networks in order to root out any possible "offenders". In an <A 
HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-appendix.html">analysis by 
the Center for Democracy and Technology</A>, the authors point out that 
"service providers would be forced to closely monitor every private 
communication, electronic mail message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or
available on their network, a proposition which poses a substantial
threat to the freedom of speech and privacy rights of all American
citizens".</P> 
<P>What becomes interesting here is the collusion of censorship issues 
with surveillance/privacy issues. Should S. 314 pass, not only would it 
entail the censorship of material which fell under the rubric of the <A 
HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/hr1004.html">1934 
Communications Act</A>(specifically, Section 223, that prevents minors 
access to "indecent" audiotext), it would also force service providers to 
constantly 
monitor the types of transmissions occurring at all times. In effect, the 
bill seems to be another example of a broadly scoped and poorly drafted 
attempt too apply out-dated  methods of surveillance and regulation to 
technology designed in large part to counteract such restrictionists. The 
Internet relys on the speedy and open transfer of information. Given the 
drain already on providers just to offer basic access, a bill such as 
S. 314would 
unduly afflict both provider and user with impractical guidelines and 
regulations.</P> 


<H2>IV. ORGANIZATIONS DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES</H2>

<P>Numerous organizations have popped up since the Internet's inception to 
monitor and advocate positions regarding issues of privacy and censorship 
on computer networks. Two of the most prominent of these groups are the 
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation(EFF)</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/CAF/">Computers and Academic Freedom(CAF)</A>. 
The EFF deals especially with issues involving Constitutional rights of the  First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, and "democratic values".
Their stated goals include establishing <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Legal/">new laws</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/OP/op2.0">policies for network 
providers</A>, a <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/OP/op2_0.summary">"national 
information infrastructure"</A>, and providing a format 
in which "all citizens" have <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/">input</A> in 
the "information age". They also 
sponsor legal cases that involve violations of users' civil liberties 
and maintain useful archives of legislation, cases, and incidences of 
censorship. The group also puts out position papers on related issues and 
impending legislation that effects the on-line community.
<P>Computers and Academic Freedom provide an incredibly extensive array 
of papers dealing in issues of privacy, access, and censorship, as well 
as maintaining vast archives of case work. Their <A 
HREF="http://www.eff.org/CAF/faq/">FAQ page</A> is an excellent quick 
reference to some of the major debates and questions regarding 
telecommunication regulation.</P>

<H2>V. CONCLUSION</H2>
<P> In no way should this brief overview of issues of censorship and 
privacy be construed as exhaustive. Literally thousands of individual 
cases have sprung up. This paper has attempted to deal with some of the 
major trends regarding these topics, some of the overlying concerns for the 
on-line community, current issues and bills that threaten to alter how 
the Internet operates, and lastly, two of the best sources to go to in 
order to keep abreast on any crucial developments. Privacy and 
censorship on the Net will undoubtedly remain prevalent and hotly 
contested in the future. As long as one remains an engaged user of the Net, 
one should not fail to stay informed.

<H2>Proposal:</H2>
		Using these sights and using some of the resources whose links these
documents provide, I will deal with both general issues and specific
cases involving attempts to regulate transmissions of various sorts over
the Internet. This will include attempts at surveillance and wiretap by
the FBI, issues of  censorship and the law, and various instances of 
infringements upon freedom of expression over the information lines. To
what extent does government have a right and/or duty to regulate what
goes on over the Internet? In contrast, to what extent can we view this as a 
direct violation of the guiding "ethic" of the on-line community to both open    
and free expression? In general, what are the limits to freedom of
information exchange, and what types of topics are most often dealt with
along these lines? These are some of the major issues I will wish to
pursue in my research. Specifically, I will also cover the recent bill in
Congress to regulate this and the issues surrounding the legislation.
