<h1>Cake Cutting Really is Not a Piece of Cake</h1>

<h2>Authored by:Jeff Edmonds and Kirk Pruhs</h2>

Abstract:
<p>
We consider the well-known cake cutting problem in which a protocol wants
to divide a cake among <I>n</I>&ge;2 players in such a way that each player
believes that they got a fair share.  The standard Robertson-Webb model
allows the protocol to make two types of queries, Evaluation and Cut, to
the players.  A deterministic divide-and-conquer protocol with complexity
<I>O</I>(<I>n</I> log <I>n</I>) is known.  We provide the first &Omega;(<I>n</I> log <I>n</I>) lower bound on
the complexity of any deterministic protocol in the standard model.
