ABSTRACT: Authors study connectivity, Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian
cycle decomposition, 4-edge and 3-vertex coloring for graphs arising from
pseudoline (affine and projective) and pseudocircle (spherical) arrangements. 
Graph theoretical properties of arrangements are studied. Most interesting
result is that spherical arrangements admit decompositions into two
Hamiltonian cycles and 4-edge colorings. A number of conjectures and open
questions accompany the results.
