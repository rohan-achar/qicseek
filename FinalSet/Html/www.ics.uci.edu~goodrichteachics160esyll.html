<ul>
<li>
<b>Catalog description.</b>
Design of efficient algorithms for practical data structures in
engineering applications. Models of computation. NP-completeness.
<li>
<b>Prerequisites.</b> EECS 40, ability to program in Java.
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks,
two midterms, and a comprehensive final exam. The overall grade
will be determined as follows:
<ul>
<li> 5% from lecture attendance
<li> 20% from written homework assignments
<li> 20% from programming assignments
<li> 20% from the two midterms (10% each)
<li> 35% from the final.
</ul>
Group work on the written homeworks is permitted, but each
student must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
Programming projects must be 100% <b>individual</b> efforts.
Submitted code will be subjected to a rigorous similarity checking
system at UC-Berkeley, 
known as <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html">MOSS</a>,
and non-negligible similarities between different student submissions
will be considered as cheating for both students (so don't even show
your code to other students).
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on programming projects
will have
a letter placed in their permanent record at UCI
and, at a minimum, receive a score of zero points on the work in question.
Late homework assignments and projects will not be accepted.<br>
</li>

<li><b>Exam policy.</b>
Exam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration
is allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams 
will be considered cheating.
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a 
failing grade in the class and have a letter describing the incident
placed in their permanent UCI record.

<li><b>Add/drop policy.</b> 
Drops will be accepted only up to the first midterm. 
Once your drop card has been
signed, further coursework from you will not be graded. After the
seventh week of classes, withdrawals will be allowed only by
petition and under documented extenuating circumstances.
