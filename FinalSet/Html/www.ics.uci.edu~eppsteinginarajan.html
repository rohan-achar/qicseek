From an invited talk by V. T. Rajan at the
<A HREF="http://ams.sunysb.edu/~held/proc_usb_comp_geo-95.html">
5th MSI Worksh. on Computational Geometry</A>,
Stony Brook, October 20, 1995.  Notes by D. Eppstein.

<H2>Problems</H2>

In his invited talk, Rajan discussed several geometric problems in VLSI
layout and analysis:

<UL>
<LI>Polygon simplification.  In the specific version Rajan gave, one is
given a polygonal input P and must output a simpler polygon C which
covers the input, together with (the boundary representation of) the
set-theoretic difference C-P.  C must have axis-parallel sides, although P need
not, and the goal is to choose a C having a given number of edges and
minimizing the area of C-P.  He didn't say what this was used for, but
I've seen similar problems applied to PC board simulation.
He described a greedy heuristic for this problem but
could find no theoretical results.

<LI>Design rule verification.  The usual sort of rule one wants to check
is that objects of certain types are separated by certain distances, but
he also talked at some length about rules requiring that e.g. every 100
by 100 micron square region of a chip should be covered by metal at a
density of between 30% and 50% (in order for the fabrication process to
work well).

<LI>Calculation of capacitance between pairs of polygons
(either overlapping or adjacent to each other in the layout).

<LI>Logic verification.  Interpretation of layout features as components and nets,
and verification that the circuit matches the original logic design.

<LI>Process proximity correction.  In the fabrication process, feature shapes will
be affected by the presence or absence of nearby objects, and this needs
to be pre-corrected for in the design.
</UL>

<H2>Assumptions and Requirements</H2>

There are several factors relevant here for selection of an algorithm.
The input coordinates come from the design process and are
assumed to be integers.  The integer units do not necessarily
correspond to the feature size, and sometimes one may want to round
the input to a larger grid, but this should be done in a way
that will avoid introducing unnecessary degeneracy.
The results of an algorithm should be exact rather
than approximate; in particular floating point computation is only acceptable
as a way of speeding up exact integer arithmetic, but is not acceptable
if it leads to round-off.  Therefore one can't in native code work with
equations of much higher degree than quadratic.

<P>
Robustness is very important - the program must work well even for
degenerate or somewhat malformed input.  The input polygon sides are
likely to be mostly axis-parallel, but some diagonals can occur,
especially at 45 degree angles.  (There appears to be little in the way
of theoretical results on such "almost-orthogonal" inputs.  Automated
layout typically produces axis-parallel layouts but critical regions are
likely to have been hand optimized with sides of other angles.)  Worst
case time complexity is important, but the program should also be
asymptotically good in the average case, since invariably people will
run his codes on much larger inputs than he was anticipating.  It is
also important that the program run well on small inputs, since the
other thing people do with his code is run it on batches of very many
small inputs.

<P>
Any algorithms used
must be simple enough that they can implement them quickly, and
so that they can make changes later if necessary.
Object oriented design is important - Rajan has found that
imperative-style pseudo-code is a bad way of communicating with his programmers.

<P>
One particular feature of the input is problematic, and not adequately
treated by the theory literature.  The inputs Rajan deals with often come
from hierarchical specifications, in which an object at one level of the
specification may
be repeated several times at a higher level.  One can flatten this
specification out to form the usual sort of polygonal input, but at a
cost of multiplying the size by a large factor, typically from around 5
for random logic to around 50 for memory.  It would be helpful
to develop algorithms that could deal with this sort of hierarchical
representation directly.

<H2>Implementation</H2>

Initially they were solving the sorts of problems listed above using a
sweep-line technique
that was originally written with the assumption of axis-parallel sides,
and that had been modified to support 45 degree lines as well.
However they were finding it inflexible and insufficiently robust.

<P>
Inspired by Sugihara's experiments showing that randomized incremental
Voronoi diagrams could be practical for large inputs,
Rajan then had a programmer working with him write up Mulmuley's randomized
incremental algorithm for constructing trapezoidal decompositions of
line segment arrangements.  Among the advantages of explicitly
constructing a trapezoidal decomposition are that you can re-use it
several times, and that you can choose your favorite order to traverse it.

<P>The choice of a data representation turned
out to be important; Rajan first told the programmer to do anything that
seemed reasonable, but the project bogged down
before he could get it working.  Rajan then tried Guibas and Stolfi's
quad-edge data structure, which worked much better but perhaps involves
more overhead than necessary.  At the time, the extra overhead was unimportant
because this part of the code was still much faster than the other
things being done to the input,
but now those other things have been improved and he's thinking of
trying to speed up the trapezoidal decomposition by using a more
streamlined data structure.

<P>
Nowadays, whenever someone comes to Rajan with a geometric problem,
he tries to fit it into his trapezoidal decomposition framework.
For instance one can test for overlapping objects
(or, after blowing up each object by a given amount, test for objects
that are too close to each other) by simply keeping a count for each
cell of the number of objects covering that cell, incrementing or decrementing
the count as one traverses the decomposition.

<P>
Rajan also talked at some length about his implementation for
testing density ground rules.  For the example of such a rule described earlier,
he would first reduce the complexity of the problem by
partitioning the input region into 10 by 10 micron squares, and computing
the density within each square.  He then only considers 100 by 100 micron
squares aligned with the 10 by 10 grid.  The density in each large
square can then be found by averaging 100 small square values.
But by using standard running total techniques one can instead use only
O(1) operations per large square.
To find the density in each small square, he overlays the original input
with a grid, using his trapezoidal decomposition
(he cited some GIS-related work here).

<P>
A question from the audience asked how he tells, with such large
inputs (as much as 2 gigabytes) whether his algorithms really are
correct.  The answer is of course testing, on smaller examples, and
especially cross-comparison with previous codes for the same problem.
When the two differ, he then has to tediously by hand try to figure out
why.  His co-workers are very conservative about replacing working code,
and even when he finds discrepancies caused by bugs in the old code it
is hard to persuade them that the bugs are a problem - they would
sometimes prefer his new code be consistent with the bugs.  The final
test of correctness is whether the VLSI chip works - if it doesn't,
that's a costly $100,000 mistake.  If it does, no one cares whether the
analysis was perfect.

<H2>Computational Results</H2>

Rajan showed some tables of numbers showing that the trapezoidal decomposition
(which is robust and works for inputs of all angles) is about ten times slower than
the more specialized plane sweep method.  However it is also about ten times
newer so the comparison is not really fair; also he pointed out that
the factor is constant rather than polynomial.  (He also compared both methods
with another method for one problem that was polynomially worse; as one would expect,
the polynomial won out over the constants quickly.)

<P>
Later, we discussed these numbers in a conversation with Ken Clarkson
and Mike Goodrich (but after Rajan had left).  Ken seemed to think that
the factor of ten was pretty typical for plane sweep vs. randomized
incremental techniques.  The main advantage he seems to be gaining from
the randomized incremental technique is that Rajan has already written it
and doesn't need to change it for each new problem he solves.
But we wondered whether it wouldn't make sense to replace his code with
code that constructs the same trapezoidal decomposition using a plane sweep method.
(The difference between this and where he started was that the original
code did not construct a trapezoidalization, instead it apparently required you
to fit whatever else you were doing into the plane sweep.)
