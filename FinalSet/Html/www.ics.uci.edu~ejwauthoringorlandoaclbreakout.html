<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>
Breakout session on WebDAV Access Control</h2>

<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>IETF-43, Orlando, Florida<BR>Wednesday, December 9, starting at 15:30</h3>

<P>A breakout session on access control for WebDAV was held on
Wednesday, December 9, 1998.  This was not a official meeting of the
WebDAV working group.  However, since the discussions are of general
interest to working group members, these minutes were taken to record
the discussion.  Jim Whitehead recorded the minutes, and attempted to
mediate floor control during the session.  In attendance during the
breakout session were: Jim Amsden, Derek Atkins, Ken Coar, Yaron
Goland, Paul Hill, Alex Hopmann, Manoj Kasichainula, Rohit Khare, Paul
Leach, Lisa Lippert, Larry Masinter, Judy Slein, Jim Whitehead.

<P><B>SCOPE OF EFFORT: ACCESS CONTROL FOR WEB OR WEBDAV?</B>

<P>The first discussion concerned the scope of the access control
effort.  It was noted that the web in general, not just WebDAV, has a
need for a protocol for access control.  It was recommended that
WebDAV access control develop a model document, so that WebDAV access
control can be applied to other domains/protocols more easily.  The
model document can separate out those aspects of the access control
protocol which are not specifically tied to WebDAV.

<P>** The attendees agreed that the access control effort should
attempt HTTP access control, as well as WebDAV access control, unless
it is proven to be too difficult to do both.  That is, the protocol
should use WebDAV mechanisms to set and read access control, but
access control should be applicable to HTTP operations in general, and
not just limited to WebDAV operations.

<P><B>INTENDED USER OF THE PROTOCOL: ADMINISTRATORS OR AUTHORS?</B>

<P>There was some discussion over who is intended to be the user of
this protocol.  Is the access control protocol intended for users who
will be performing authoring, or is it intended for use by system
administrators, who are interested in access control across an entire
site.

<P><B>INHERITANCE:</B>

<P>The topic of inheritance was discussed.  It was noted that the
access control inheritance within WebDAV is WebDAV-specific, since it
is tied to WebDAV collections.  However, Calendaring and Scheduling
has a different inheritance model.  A participant raised the question
of whether we should support multiple kinds of inheritance.  Today,
servers support multiple kinds of inheritance, and hence it would be
desirable for the protocol to accomodate these servers.  However, the
complexity of the user interface on the client is an important issue.
Supporting multiple inheritance models would make the user interface
on the client more complex, and, some argued, too complex.

<P>There was a suggestion to examine the Java Web Server for lessons
which can be learned from its access control model, which is
object-oriented.

<P><B>WEB-FORM MODEL FOR ACCESS CONTROL:</B>

<P>A short-term solution for access control is to have a property
recorded on each resource which records a link pointing to a Web page
which contains an access control form.  By manipulating the form using
a Web browser, a user can modify the access control for the resource.
This approach has the benefit that it can accomodate a wide range of
repositories, and each repository can have an access control user
interface which is tailored to the repository.  This approach can be
specified and fielded quickly.

<P>The most significant drawback to this approach its lack of support
for a programatic interface to access control.  Furthermore, users
will be required to understand the access control mechanism for each
server they author against.  If the goal is to provide access control
for the Web, and not just for WebDAV, the Web-form approach has the
drawback that it depends on WebDAV properties, which are not
understood by downlevel Web clients.  However, if these clients
discover the Web-form page without reading a property, they could
manipulate the Web-form. Finally, the Web-form approach provides only
a coarse degree of interoperability.

<P>However, it was noted that once a protocol for access control was
finished, the access control property might still be useful as an
"escape hatch" for more sophisticated access control capabilities.
However, if this were done, it would be necessary to call out which
functionality can be access via the Web-form interface, and which can
be accessed programatically.

<P>Yaron Goland volunteered to write up a draft specification for the
Web-form approach.

<P><B>GROUPS:</B>

<P>Groups were felt to be out of scope, since they are a (LDAP)
directory concept.  However, the Java Web Server supports a notion of
realms (HTTP realms).

<P><B>MAPPING OF ACCESS CONTROL PROTOCOL TO REPOSITORY ACCESS CONTROL:</B>

<P>Access control for resources which are accessible via multiple
protocols, such as via HTTP and FTP, directly leads to this issue.
For resources which are accessible via multiple protocols, access
control via only one protocol is not a viable security model.  One way
to address this problem is to ensure that access control set via one
protocol actually sets the access control for the underlying
repository where the data is stored.  In this way, access control set
via one protocol will apply to all other protocols used to access the
same resource.

<P>However, it is a difficult problem to map access control rights in
the protocol into the appropriate rights in the underlying
repository. The difficulty arises from the case where there is not a
1:1 mapping of rights from protocol to repository, which either leads
to unpredictable behavior (rejecting a request), or the inadvertent
opening of security holes (performing the request has unintended
side-effects). This concern applies to all network protocols, and is
not specific to the Web, or WebDAV.

<P>The following "database cell" scenario was discussed during the
breakout session, and highlights this issue.  Assume there is a
database which is being accessed via WebDAV.  Each cell in the
database contains a PUT body and WebDAV properties.  The database has
a very simple "1 write bit" access control mechanism - when the write
bit is "1", you can write to the entire cell, and when the write bit
is "0", you cannot write to any of the cell's contents.  Assume the
WebDAV access control protocol has separate access rights for "write
properties" and "write (PUT) body".

<P>The problem arises when trying to map the "write properties" access
control right into the rights supported by the repository.  If the
client submits a protocol request to grant it the "write properties"
right, the repository has two choices:

<OL>
<LI>It can refuse to set the
write bit for the database cell, causing the protocol request to fail.
<LI>It can set the write bit, causing the protocol request to succeed.
This has the unintended consequence of allowing write access to the
PUT body as well, thus creating a security risk.
</OL>

<P>There are two general approaches for handling this issue:
<OL>
<LI>Define a normative (generic) set of rights (e.g., the "DAV set" of
rights), some of which might not apply to a given server.  A client
then performs access control operations using this set of rights.
This approach is easiest for clients.
<LI>Discover the set of rights.  A client must first perform discovery
on the set of rights supported by the server, and then may perform
access control operations using these rights.
</OL>

<P>There was agreement that setting an access control right should not
result in unintended consequences, that is, consequences which are not
safe with respect to the underlying semantics of the store.

<P>There was general agreement with the principle: in the event of a
conflict between the semantics of the underlying repository's access
control capabilities, and the semantics of a particular access control
protocol request, the underlying repository semantics should always
take precedence.  There was general recognition that some access
control protocol requests might not be mappable into the access
control operations supported by a given repository.

<P>There was agreement that the mapping issue needs to be recorded -
these minutes are a start at that, though it should also be explicitly
discussed in the protocol document, and probably also the goals
document.

<P>There was agreement that it would help discussion to know the
access control semantics for several repositories.

<P>Finally, it was noted that IMAP access control should be examined
for lessons learned.  It's approach is similar to #2 above in that the
client first performs discovery, which returns sets of methods whose
access control can be modified as a set.

<P><B>PROBLEMS WITH METHOD-BASED ACCESS CONTROL</B>

<P>There was discussion at the meeting on the use of method-based
access control, that is, access control where the access rights map
exactly to HTTP methods.  Several participants at the breakout felt
this approach is a bad idea.

<P>This approach has the benefit that it maps exactly onto HTTP
methods, which have specific semantics.  Thus the exact outcome of
setting a given access control right is well understood by client and
server.  A protocol which adopts this approach would likely be more
simple to specify and implement than other alternatives.

<P>The drawbacks to this approach become evident when examining
resources which are accessible via more than one protocol.  In this
case, HTTP methods might not map exactly onto operations available in
other protocols.  Furthermore, HTTP methods might not map exactly onto
the access control rights provided by the underlying repository.  Due
to this, clients would need to perform a trial-and-error style of
interaction when trying to set access control permissions, since
presumably the underlying store would reject attempts to set access
control permissions which would result in security risks due to
unintended side-effects.  The other drawback to method-based access
control is the difficulty of making a user-interface for the protocol.
The majority of users are not aware of the methods in the HTTP
protocol, and hence would be unable to set access control correctly
using a user interface which exposes the HTTP methods.

<P>Most, but not all, participants at the breakout session felt that
an approach which defines "semantic" access rights (e.g., "modify",
"read", etc.) and then maps them into methods (e.g., "modify" -&gt; PUT,
POST, PROPPATCH) is better than a method-only approach.

<P><B>NEW WORKING GROUP FOR APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL ACCESS CONTROL:</B>

<P>There was some discussion on whether it would be better to have a
group working just on Web and WebDAV access control, or have a group
which tries to address access control across several application layer
protocols.  The advantage to addressing access control for several
protocols simultaneously is that the cross-protocol access control
issue would be substantively addressed.  This is important, because
many network resources are accessible via multiple protocols, such as
HTTP, FTP, news, mail, etc.  This would benefit administrators of
servers for these protocols.  It would also tend to build critical
mass for new application layer protocols to use this access control
protocol.

<P>The disadvantage to having a cross-protocol access control effort
is its scope.  It may prove to be too complicated to address the
access control issues of several protocols simultaneously.

<P>A cross-protocol access control effort would be expected to produce
the following deliverables:
<UL>
<LI>a model document which is applicable across protocols
<LI>a set of transport-independent objects (possibly in XML) which are
exchanged to perform access control operations
</UL>
