<span><b>HotSpot Clocks: Overview</b>

<p>The HotSpot Clocks project explores repetition across space and time in ambient displays.</p>
<p>The first aspect we consider about ambient information is its immediacy. The sound of rainfall also means that it is raining <i>right now</i>, but rainfall is a recurring phenomenon. The green tracks of raindrops on bronze statues, the width of a tree's growth rings, or the stains of high water on a river's levees may tell you something about the frequency or intensity of past rainfalls. Immediate information is useful, but so is knowledge of the history and patterns of a situated, repeating phenomenon.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the course of designing Nimio, we have noticed a corollary to situated displays. In many environments "situations" may tend to repeat themselves. Thus we see many offices in an office building, each with similar layouts and serving similar purposes. During our site study for Nimio, interviewees made a point of telling us how closely they worked together, and it is notable that they like to present themselves as a close-knit group.  At our first visit on site, most group members had jasmine blossoms in their offices.  We were told later that they were all from the same bush. While one of these jasmine branches may constitute a mere pretty office decoration, the set of them, distributed throughout many coworkers' offices, conveys information about the working relationships of this group. Nimio was meant to constitute a similar sort of display.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a city we find many traffic signals at many intersections, many schedules at many bus stops, many labeled drains and manholes. In such environments, situated displays may also become distributed displays. In an urban environment, infrastructural access points can easily be read as distributed displays. Parking signs are access points to a legal infrastructure regulating parking in the city. Manhole covers typically fade into the background, a generally unnoticeable part of the urban landscape (unless the covers are removed and the hole revealed); however, a closer look reveals care in labeling. The distribution of manhole covers can be used to discern the routing of water, sewerage and electric infrastructures.</p>
<p>Information and computational technologies add layers of invisible infrastructure on top of familiar electrical and communicative networks. WiFi coverage, for example, is not directly visible (though the savvy geek will look for gatherings of like-minded people with their laptops out). The HotSpot Clock attempts to render visible not only the presence of a nearby wireless access point, but the current amount of activity on it, and the long-term temporal patterns of use of that access point. In an office building containing several access points, it can provide spatially distributed information concerning activity in different portions of the building, providing clues to human activity based on wireless internet activity.</p></span>
