<H2>Research in Software Explanation &shy; David F. Redmiles</H2>

<P><IMG SRC="final-screen.gif" HEIGHT=188 WIDTH=268 ALIGN=LEFT>This research
focuses on the problem of supporting programmers in using complex software
libraries. It develops a cognitive theory of supporting programmers with
examples and explanations. The theory is motivated by previous cognitive
studies of programmers as well as real consulting experience. The theory
is instantiated in a system called EXPLAINER running on a Symbolics Lisp
machine. EXPLAINER relies on a semantic network representation of program
examples which captures multiple knowledge perspectives. The theory is
substantiated by tests of the EXPLAINER system both in a classroom setting
and in a controlled empirical study.</P>

<P>To its users, EXPLAINER appears much like a hypermedia or computer-aided
software engineering (CASE) tool. Users can view diagrammed schemas of
program examples, code listings, sample execution, and text explanation.
The contents of these views can be clicked on with a mouse to expand views
and access additional information. However, unlike hypermedia tools, the
information in the views is being generated in real time from a semantic
network representation of the example. Unlike CASE tools, the diagrammed
schemas and text explanation are based on knowledge perspectives about
the problem the example solves and not just the structure of the example
program code. Basically, in terms of cognitive theory, EXPLAINER provides
its users with the &quot;programming plans&quot; underlying an example.</P>

<P>In a classroom evaluation, students learned about expert systems programming
by reviewing a Mycin-like system represented in EXPLAINER. Students using
EXPLAINER were able to better answer general questions about expert systems
than students who reviewed the code and documentation on their own. In
a more rigorous test, EXPLAINER was compared in a programming task against
support provided by a hypermedia system providing conventional documentation.
Programmers using EXPLAINER exhibited a more controlled and directed problem-solving
process compared to those using the more conventional, though on-line,
documentation. Observations in this test are corroborated by statistical
analyses based on variances measured in the control groups. The result
is positive in light of studies to date which have found programmers performing
with great individual variability independent of the support tool provided.
The success of EXPLAINER is attributed to its providing explanations based
on programming plans and multiple perspective representations.</P>
