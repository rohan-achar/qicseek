hi
David Langsam was my grandmothers brother...my mother was born in
1912...my grandmother died  in 1978 at the age of 94? we think so
she should have been born 1884...I will try to talk to my uncle 
as soon as possible..he just had a mild stroke..David and Rose 
according to my mother had 3 children..2 sons Lester, Louie and 
maybe a daughter..my grandmother esther feldman lived on howard 
avenue than she moved to east 54th street and avenue k
Keep in touch
Susan
