<h2>Banff From Sulphur Mountain</h2>

The low hill in the middle is Tunnel Mountain, so called because they didn't build a railroad tunnel through it, and the complex at the base of the mountain is Banff Centre, where WADS was held. The hour and a half between the talks and the banquet on Saturday evening was (barely) enough to hike to the top of it and back. The town is to the left of the hill, and the Banff Lodge is on this side of the Bow River from the hill. The hoodoos on the river are where it meets a low bluff in the right background.
