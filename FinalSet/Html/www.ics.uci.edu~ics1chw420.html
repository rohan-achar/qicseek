<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World-Wide Web</A> has yet to be fully embraced by educators at the high school and grade school levels. The problem  arising  from the fact  that only a small portion of public high schools and elementary schools have access to the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.03.html">Internet</A>. Once more educators realize the potential of the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.03.html">Internet</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World-Wide Web</A> will there be an increased demand for the web's resources in classrooms.  When this happens those currently accessing the web for educational purposes can expect increased research and developement in  web technology that will cater  more specifically to their needs. Moreover, the World-Wide Web's recent explosion in growth has already made news headlines. This attention the web has gained will hopefully continue to climb. If so, the interest of providing web service to grade school and high school stude
nts will likely increase as well.

<P>
The driving force behind the use of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World-Wide Web</A> as an instructional tool lies in the web's ability to provide a limitless amount of information through a multimedia interface.  A web page further reinforces its own value as a multimedia document by employing its own links to other documents via <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61/guide.02.html">hypertext</A>.
<P>
In the document, <A HREF="http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/WWW95/paper.html">Advanced Educational Uses of the World-Wide Web</A>, <A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/"> Stephen Franklin</A> and <A HREF="http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/Bertrand.html"> Bertrand Ibrahim</A>  discuss two methods the classroom teacher can employ while using the web as a teaching tool. The first method discussed is to use web technology and corresponding browser technology to create web documents that model normal subject oriented course material or implementing a "closed corpus" strategy. An example of this strategy includes web documents that implement "fill-out forms". These "fill-out forms" allow students to enter data into a web document at specified places, therefore eliminating the need for homework assignments to be placed on paper.  Students would submit their answers via the "fill-out form". The second way the web can be used is for specific information retrieval and reference or using an "open corpus" strategy. 
 An example of this strategy would be assigning students to pick a certain subject area to explore on the web, having them browse the web's domain in that area, and submit their own web document about the subject area they were exploring. 
<P>
The examples given above provide excellent use of web technology and its ability to incorporate distance learning. Distance learning does not take place in a classroom or at a library.  Distance learning maintains the idea that one document can serve millions of people who never have to leave a computer terminal to gain that documents information.
<P>
A final important note to make is that web documents are online, meaning they can be continuously be updated, changed, and refined, unlike a textbook or any other static physical object. With these points in mind the web's value, as a dynamic and ever expanding resource, cannot be ignored by the remaining  majority of our educators.

<A NAME="Current"><h2>2. Current Programs and Research</h2></A>
While browsing the web, you will realize that there is quite a bit of
information - sometimes there is even more information then you can
need - on each subject. This continues to be the case when researching
educational topics originating within the web.

<P>
Research is being completed and documents on educational projects are being produced so that there are a number of  programs available for students and teachers.  There are many <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/icmc/applications-education.html">educational applications</A> available on the web and with scientific and technological advances, educators may be able to provide updated methods of teaching.
<P>
 Through completed projects there was the creation of many educational programs such as the:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="http://ics.soe.umich.edu/">Dewey Web</A>. The Dewey Web not only serves information to students.  It also  provides students a chance to share their knowledge with students all over the world. 
<P>
<LI> <A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/resource.cntnts.html">EdWeb's Table

<LI> The <A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/swep.html">SchoolWeb Exploration Project (SWEP)</A>. The future of the Word-Wide Web and k-12 educational use lies in projects similar to SWEP.  In fact, their goal is to expand the use of the World-Wide Web in primary and secondary education.  So far they have gotten their first SWEP site up and running at <A HREF="http://www.elk-grove.k12.il.us/schoolweb/highland">Highland Middle School</A>. 
<LI> The <A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/wwwedu.html">WWWEDU Home Page</A>. Another project whose goal is dedicated to the use of the World-Wide Web in education. Their target: educators, webmasters, and web providers.

<A NAME="A&D"><h2>3. Advantages and Disadvantages</h2></A>

There are many advantages as well as disadvantages for everything, 
even in using the Web.  An important advantage in using the Web as a tool 
for teaching is that:
<P>

         The World Wide Web is a useful browser.  It makes it possible for 
         the user to navigate the Net.  It also provides links from one 
         information source to another information source.  This is very
         useful to both students and teachers because this gives them a 
         chance to explore exciting educational sites that are available. 
         This also gives them an opportunity to share their knowledge and 
         findings on various interest subjects with people around the 
         world.  Thus, it makes learning fun.  For example, if students in 
         California wanted to know about the weather or what kinds of
         damages were created during the earthquake Japan had earlier this 
         year, they can find out by using the programs on the Web.  This
         will give students valuable learning that is fun.  
<P>
 
There are also disadvantages of using the Web.  For instance, it could be 
quite confusing because sometimes we are unable to proceed with our 
navigation within the Web.  This is due to the problems with navigational 
links where there are missing links, errors within the link (because it 
moved to a different server), or even because of design problems.  
Another problem would be that there is so much information available out 
there that you just do not know which ones contain valuable information.  
This is known as <A HREF="http://www.primus.com/staff/paulp/useless.html">Useless WWW Pages</A>. Similar to worthless web pages are pages that are literally listed as  <A HREF="http://turnpike.net/metro/mirsky/Worst.html">Worst of the Web (TM)</A>. 

<P>
    "In an educational context World Wide Web clients such as 
     Mosaic are of limited value because they put learners into 
     the role of information absorbers...Despite the richness of 
     exhibits in terms of the amount of material presented and 
     the use of multimedia, activity is resricted to navigation 
     through a real (museum) or hyper (Mosaic) spaces."

<P>
Although there are many problems in using the World Wide Web, it is still 
considered as a useful tool in education because with the ever increasing 
demand in science and technology there will be changes and modifications 
to these programs.  Pretty soon there will be newer programs and ways of 
obtaining educational resources.

<HR>
<A NAME="Security"><h2>4. Security Issues</h2></A>

There are two main security issues that face educators and developers when using the
web in education. The first concern implies that young students who have access to the Internet may obtain pornographic and obscene material. The second security issue concerns web bandwidth.  Children, whether they realize it or not, may retrieve enormous amounts of data thousands of miles away without a second thought of what they are doing.
<P>
Retrieving documents that contain explicit pictures or words in them is relatively easy and only takes a fair amount of browsing to accomplish. Students who do gain the ability to browse the web can painlessly discover links that can take them to pages  similar to <A HREF="http://www.netaxs.com/people/beauty/netsex.html/">The Complete Internet Sex Resource Guide.</A> (A web document that provides access to several adult oriented Internet sites.) The resourcefulness of one student can quickly lead to many students gaining the URL to such a document. Security measures must be initiated to insure that students do not gain access to such things or the internet's community  relations could suffer.
<P>
There are two obvious security methods to use in  guarding students from adult-oriented material on the web.  One method is to continually monitor students  as they traverse the web. The second is the creation of web technology  that can be better protected against unwanted retrievals.
<P>
There  is one tool already available in the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.07.html">Mosaic</A> browser called <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-on-version-2.5b.html"><I>kiosk mode</I>.</A> <I>Kiosk</I> mode removes the menubar and all control bar options except <I>back, forward, home</I> and <I>close</I>. Which limits some of the functionality of a particular document  but the hypertext links will still be available.  So use of the <I>kiosk</I> mode is limited at best.
<P>
At the December 1994 <A HREF="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">Internet Engineering Task Force</A> meeting <A HREF="http://www-ns.rutgers.edu/www-security/https-wg.html">The IETF HTTP Security Working Group</A> was put into action to develop requirements and specifications for security services for the web's protocol, HTTP. Working groups for WWW/HTTP security are just getting into action as indicated by the <A HREF="http://www-ns.rutgers.edu/www-security/index.html">Rutgers WWW-Security Index</A > home page.
<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="Tech"><h2>5. Technical Difficulties</h2></A>
The main technical difficulties that plague the k-12 educational community are:
<UL>
<LI> The ability of the web to deliver high-quality education at great distances over a shorter amount of time. (Children will quickly become irritated during a slow connection.)
<P>
<LI> The development of  programs that will allow  teachers to effieciently produce quality material for their students use on the World-Wide Web.
</UL>
<P>
Since client programs request services from servers the first technological difficulty lies within web servers. The most crucial part of the server-client relationship is latency. Latency has several factors, including the client program's ability of displaying retrieved data and a server's hardware slowness, however the major problem is the web network's own latency. Latency due to propagation delays. These delays stem from the fact that the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) makes too many unnecessary round trips when gathering information for a client. Improvements in latency overhead will undoubtably improve the speed at which documets on the web can be accessed and therefore displayed. A notable effort in <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/IT94/Proceedings/DDay/mogul/HTTPLatency.html">Improving HTTP Latency</A> was turned in by Venkata N. Padmanabhan (University of California-Berkeley) and Jeffrey C. Mogul (Digital Equipment Corporation Western Research Laboratory), their idea to improve latency by 
making simple changes to the HTTP protocol and its implementations resulted in significantly improved response times.
<P>
The second technological difficulty is provding  programs to help teachers  develop educational material for their students.  An excellent example of a walkthru guide on how a teacher could set up the World-Wide Web for his/her classroom is the <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/contents.html">Web66 Internet Server Kitchen</A>. web pages such as this one and improvements in the technology of "fill-out forms" as mentioned in <A HREF="http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/WWW95/paper.html">Advanced Educational Uses of the World_Wide Web</A> are just the beginnig of the offerings that the web will soon be producing for primary and
secondary educators.
