<P>
The use of Earned Value as a project management tool is recognized
world-wide as an industry best practice. Yet in software development
Earned
Value frequently results in frustration as the benefits derived seem
less
than the effort expended.  This unfortunate experience often deters
organizations from further use of Earned Value, or results in less rigorous
implementations leading to even less benefit.  Much of the difficulty in
applying Earned Value to software projects is due to the very nature of
software
development.  Requirements creep, code growth, unclear completion
criteria,
and system integration problems are examples of the challenges in
applying
Earned Value to software development. Additionally, system and software
development has grown in complexity in the twenty-five years since
Earned
Value was first defined.  Still we try to use the original concepts,
unchanged. This talk will address the traps that are often encountered
in
the application of Earned Value.  Recommendations and novel concepts
will be
presented to avoid these traps. Suggested refinements to the basic
Earned
Value concepts will be discussed to reduce the frustration and add to
the
benefit. Level-of-Effort (LOE) measurement, the meaningless method of
recording accomplishment, will be addressed.  Formulas to compensate
Earned
Value indicators for LOE will be shown to reduce the negative impact of
this
measurement scheme.  Time will be allowed for significant discussions,
questions, and challenges to the concepts discussed.
