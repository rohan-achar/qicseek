<H2> Abstract </H2>

Although event-based software integration is one of the most prevalent 
approaches to loose integration, no consistent model for describing it 
exists. As a result, there is no uniform way to discuss event-based 
integration, compare approaches and implementations, specify new event-based 
approaches, match user requirements with the capabilities of event-based 
integration products, and so on. We attempt to address these shortcomings 
by specifying a generic, event-based integration framework that provides 
a flexible model for discussing and comparing event-based integration 
approaches. This model supports dynamic and static specification, composition 
and decomposition, and can be instantiated to describe the features of 
most common event-based integration approaches. To demonstrate this, 
mappings to several popular products are presented.
