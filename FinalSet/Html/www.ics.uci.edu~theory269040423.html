Optimal Power-Down Strategies
<br>
John Augustine

</h2>
<p>
We consider the problem of selecting threshold times to transition a 
device to low-power sleep states during an idle period. The two-state 
case in which there is a single active and a single sleep state is a 
continuous version of the ski-rental problem. We consider a generalized 
version in which there is more than one sleep state, each with its own 
power consumption rate and transition costs. We give an algorithm that, 
given a system, produces a deterministic strategy whose competitive 
ratio is arbitrarily close to optimal. We also give an algorithm to 
produce the optimal online strategy given a system and a probability 
distribution that generates the length of the idle period. We also give 
a simple algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 5.828 for any 
system.
