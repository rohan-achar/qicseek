	This site is aimed at researchers with Jewish Miller roots anywhere in the world.
	<BR><BR>
	The family tree starts in Galicia, around 1730. It contains over six-thousand descendants from our original Miller, <B><A HREF="langsam.htm#L1">Avrohm Aba</A></B>. His surname was different than that of his father, <a href="langsam/homelang.htm">Pesach Langsam</a>, possibly because he was the oldest child and not living at home when the family adopted the surname of Langsam.
	By the 1860's his family was well dispersed throughout much of Eastern Europe. By 1900 there were Millers from this family in Western Europe, North America, Asia, and 
	Africa. Today his descendants live on six continents.<p>

	<B>Please note: Many family members bear spelling variations of the name Miller. The Yiddish was Miller. However, the legal name was often M&uuml;ller (with an umlaut). Do not discount the possibility of a connection based on the spelling of the name.</B>

	I am in the process of updating the site, including the
	<A HREF="othrmilr.htm">Other Miller Trees</A> link. This will contain trees that were sent to me for which I currently find no connection. If you find this helpful, please let me know.
