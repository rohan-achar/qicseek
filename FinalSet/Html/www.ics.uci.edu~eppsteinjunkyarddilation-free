<H1>Dilation-Free Planar Graphs</H1>

Suppose you've been hired to lay out the buildings of a college campus.  
College students are disrespectful of authority (at least, of campus 
planners) and will cut new paths through the campus lawns between any 
buildings not already directly connected by paths.  So will the faculty.  
But then, wherever two paths meet, some entrepreneur is likely to place a 
coffee stand.  This new coffee stand will attract students, who will form 
paths from it to all campus buildings, etc.  Before long, your campus will 
be all covered by paths, with no lawn left.  Or will it?  How can you lay 
out your campus so that all buildings are already directly connected by 
paths, without forming crossroads and encouraging coffee-stand builders?

<P>We can express this problem using the notion of <I>dilation</I>.  
The dilation of a pair of vertices in an embedded planar graph is the 
ratio between two kinds of distance: the length of the shortest path 
between them in the graph, and their geometric distance.  The dilation 
of the graph is the maximum dilation of any two of its vertices.  A graph 
has dilation one if and only if there is a direct path between each pair 
of vertices.  Which graphs can have dilation one?

<P>The pattern of solutions is common to many areas of mathematics: there 
are several infinite families of solutions, together with a few isolated 
special cases.  Actually, here there is exactly one special case.
First, the infinite families.  Note that, if there are five or more 
vertices in the graph, some path must have two or more edges (there is no 
way to find a planar embedding of a five-vertex graph in which each vertex 
is connected to each other by a single edge).  Let P denote the path 
having the most vertices; then there are four infinite families:

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500>
<TR VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT>
<TD>1. All vertices are on&nbsp;P:</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="z.gif" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=17 ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT>
<TD>2. One vertex is not on&nbsp;P:</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="w.gif" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=55 ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT>
<TD>3. Two vertices are on opposite sides of P; the path between them 
passes through a vertex on&nbsp;P:</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="x.gif" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=117 ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT>
<TD>4. Two vertices are on opposite sides of the line through P; the edge 
between them misses&nbsp;P:</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="y.gif" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=186 ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>However, there is one more case:
the graph can consist of a triangle nested inside another triangle, with 
three two-edge paths formed by two inner vertices and one outer vertex.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="v.gif" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=285 ALT=""></CENTER>

<P>The proof that these are the only possibilities is a straightforward 
case analysis.  If there is at most one point on either side of P, the 
graph is in one of the four infinite families.  Otherwise, there are some 
two points x and y on the same side of P.  If line xy passes through 
an endpoint of P, we can form a subset of the graph in which five points 
form a vee.  But then, four of the points form a crossroads from which we 
can find a smaller vee, leading to an infinite regress.  If line xy misses 
any vertex of P, we can form a crossroads between x, y, and two points of P, 
again forming a vee and an infinite regress.  So, the only remaining case 
is that P has only three points, and that line xy passes through the middle 
point, forming a tee.  If this is not in one of our infinite families, 
there must be a further point z on one side or the other of xy, and the 
same analysis shows that z must be one endpoint of a line through an 
endpoint of P and the middle point of the path containing x and y.  These 
points together form the irregular case above, and it is not hard to see 
that any additional points would lead to an infinite regress.
