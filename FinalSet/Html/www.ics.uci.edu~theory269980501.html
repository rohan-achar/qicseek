Parallel and On-Line Graph Coloring<br>
Brad Hutchings, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>Brad described results from a paper by Magnus M. Halldorsson in
<i>Journal of Algorithms</i> 23, 265-280 (1987). The approximate
coloring algorithms in the paper work by forming a maximal partial
coloring with a limited number of colors. The remaining uncolored
vertices are partitioned according to their adjacencies with
members of one color class, forming a collection of subgraphs with
smaller chromatic number. These subgraphs are then colored
independently and recursively. Halldorsson shows that this approach
leads to approximation ratios of
O(<i>n</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>), not only sequentially
but also in the parallel and on-line settings.</p>
