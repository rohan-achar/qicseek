Abstract: In this paper we improve, reprove, and simplify a variety
of theorems
concerning the performance of data structures based on path
compression and
search trees. We apply a technique very familiar to computational
geometers
but still foreign to many researchers in (non-geometric) algorithms
and data
structures, namely, to bound the complexity of an object via its
forbidden substructures.

<p>
To analyze an algorithm or data structure in the forbidden
substructure
framework one proceeds in three discrete steps. First, one
transcribes the
behavior of the algorithm as some combinatorial object $M$; for
example, $M$
may be a graph, sequence, permutation, matrix, set system, or tree.
(The size
of $M$ should ideally be linear in the running time.) Second, one
shows that $M$
excludes some forbidden substructure $P$, and third, one bounds the
size of
any object avoiding this substructure. The power of this framework
derives
from the fact that $M$ lies in a more pristine environment and that
upper bounds
on the size of a $P$-free object $M$ may be taken "off the shelf".
