<H2>Making an Anchor on the Subweb</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
You can utilize the inherited Anchors and Links on the new subweb.  To
demonstrate, we will add a new anchored image to the inherited link.
</p>

<H3>Making an Anchor on a new Image</H3>

<p>
Download the image yeager_star.jpeg from the following site:
<br>
<A HREF="download.html"> Chimera 2.0 Turorial Download page</A>
<br>
Place it anywhere you like.
</p>

<p>
Display the image using Jimage.
</p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/yeager_cover.gif" WIDTH="278"
HEIGHT="382"></CENTER>


<p>
Make an anchor on the image and add it to the Active Link (x1).
</p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/yeager_add.gif" WIDTH="278"
HEIGHT="382"></CENTER>

<H3>Demonstrating that the inherited Anchors Exist</H3>

<p> Now do a link traversal on the anchor in yeager_star.jpeg by 
clicking inside the anchor area using the left mouse button. The 
two other images of the X-1 will appear with their anchors flashing.
</p>


<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/yeager_traverse.gif" WIDTH="278"
HEIGHT="382"></CENTER>

<p> Note: This partial screen-shot shows the link traversal caught at the
moment when both X-1 images are brought up with their anchors flashing.
