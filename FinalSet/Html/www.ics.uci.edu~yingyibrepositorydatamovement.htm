<p align="justify">The file &quot;movement&quot; contains 12 days' trajectories of one 
person on his way between home and office in a car, where the data are collected 
from a GPS sensor carried by the person. It contains 4 outlier regions as 
follows, each of which is a seldom event in some day's trajectory of the 12 
days'.<br>
<br>
outlier 1: 5-10, localization error.<br>
<br>
outlier 2: 6180-6330, the car detour due to some road maintenance.<br>
<br>
outlier 3: 11320-11500, the person goes out of the car to a nearby school, then 
goes back to the car.<br>
<br>
outlier 4: 16300-16500, the person goes out of car to a nearby park and goes 
back to the car.<br>
<br>
outlier 5: 30052-30010, localization error.<br>
<br>
outlier 6: 31320-31563, the person goes out of the car to a book store, and then 
goes back to the car.<br>
<br>
Note: 1. the two localization error looks similar, maybe due to the same problem 
of sensors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. the book store in outlier 6 is near the school 
in outlier 3.</p>
