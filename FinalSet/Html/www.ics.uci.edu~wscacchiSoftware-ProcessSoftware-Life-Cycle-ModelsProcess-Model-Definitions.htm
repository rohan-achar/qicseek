<FONT SIZE=5><P>Software process models often represent a networked sequence of activities, objects, transformations, and events that embody strategies for accomplishing software evolution. </P>

<P>Such models can be used to develop <U>more precise and formalized</U> descriptions of software life cycle activities. </P>

<P>Their power emerges from their utilization of a sufficiently rich notation, syntax, or semantics, often <U>suitable for computational processing</U>. </P>
