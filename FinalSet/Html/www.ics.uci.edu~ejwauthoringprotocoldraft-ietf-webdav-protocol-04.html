<h2>1    Terminology</h2>

Collection - A resource that contains member resources.

<P>Member Resource - a resource referred to by a collection. There
are two types of member resources: external and internal.

<P>Internal Member Resource - the name given to a member resource of
a collection whose URI is relative to the URI of the collection.

<P>External Member Resource - a member resource with an absolute URI
that is not relative to its parent's URI.

<P>Properties - A set of name/value pairs that contain descriptive
information about a resource.

<P>Live Properties - Properties whose semantics and syntax are
enforced by the server. For example, a live "read-only" property
that is enforced by the server would disallow PUTs to the
associated resource.

<P>Dead properties - Properties whose semantics and syntax are not
enforced by the server. A dead "read-only" property would not be
enforced by the server and thus would not be used by the server
as a reason to disallow a <TT>PUT</TT> on the associated resource.

<P>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119 [Bradner, 1997].


<h2>2    Data Model and Methods for DAV Properties</h2>

<h3>2.1  Introduction</h3>


<h4>2.1.1     The DAV Property</h4>

Properties are pieces of data that describe the state of a
resource. Properties are data about data. The term property is
used within this specification to disambiguate the concept from
the overloaded terms "metadata" and "attribute".

<P>Properties are used within distributed authoring environments to
provide for efficient discovery and management of resources. For
example, a 'subject' property might allow for the indexing of all
resources by their subject, and an 'author' property might allow
for the discovery of what authors have written which documents.


<h4>2.1.2     Existing Metadata Proposals</h4>

Properties have a long played an essential role in the
maintenance of large document repositories, and many current
proposals contain some notion of a property. These include PICS
[Miller et al., 1996], PICS-NG, the Rel/Rev draft [Maloney,
1996], Web Collections, XML [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, 1997],
several proposals on representing relationships within HTML,
digital signature manifests (DCMF), and a position paper on Web
metadata architecture [Berners-Lee, 1997].

<P>Some proposals come from a digital library perspective. These
include the Dublin Core [Weibel et al., 1995] metadata set and
the Warwick Framework [Lagoze, 1996], a container architecture
for different metadata schemas. The literature includes many
examples of metadata, including MARC [MARC, 1994], a
bibliographic metadata format, RFC 1807 [Lasher, Cohen, 1995], a
technical report bibliographic format employed by the Dienst
system, and the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata
conference describe many community-specific metadata sets.

<P>Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK
[Lagoze, 1996], noted that, "new metadata sets will develop as
the networked infrastructure matures" and "different communities
will propose, design, and be responsible for different types of
metadata." These observations can be corroborated by noting that
many community-specific sets of metadata already exist, and there
is significant motivation for the development of new forms of
metadata as many communities increasingly make their data
available in digital form, requiring a metadata format to assist
data location and cataloging.


<h4>2.1.3     Properties and HTTP Headers</h4>

Properties already exist, in a limited sense, within HTTP through
the use of message headers. However, in distributed authoring
environments a relatively large number of properties are needed
to describe the state of a resource, and setting/returning them
all through HTTP headers is inefficient. Thus a mechanism is
needed which allows a principal to identify a set of properties
in which the principal is interested and to then set or retrieve
just those properties.


<h3>2.2  A Property Model for HTTP Resources</h3>

<h4>2.2.1     Overview</h4>

The DAV property model is based on name/value doubles. The name
of a property identifies the property's syntax and semantics, and
provides an address with which to refer to a property. The name
and value of a property is expressed as a well-formed XML
element, where the name of the property is the name of the XML
element, and the value of the property MUST be either blank, or a
well-formed XML element value.


<h4>2.2.2     Property Namespace</h4>


<H4>2.2.2.1   Problem Definition</H4>

The requirement is to be able to associate a value with a
property name on a resource.  It must be possible to associate a
URL with the property name.


<H4>2.2.2.2   Solution Requirement</H4>

Ideally a property namespace should work well with extant
property implementations as well as database systems. The DAV
property namespace has been specified with the following two
facts in mind:
<LI>    Namespaces associated with flat file systems are ubiquitous.
<LI>    The majority of databases use a fixed schema mechanism.
The last point makes efficient implementation of hierarchical
properties difficult. Specifically, each property has a random
set of children; the best a relational database can do is provide
a table with name and value, where the value is a series of
indexes into other tables and each index represents a specific
value. However most RDBS do not provide for table pointers, only
index values. Such a system would have to be jury-rigged to
handle table pointers. In addition, indexing systems are
optimized for a small set of relatively large tables;
hierarchical property systems tend toward many properties, each
with different numbers and types of children, thus potentially
requiring a table for each child.

<P>It would seem best to implement a flat property namespace,
inducing a natural isomorphism between DAV and most native file
systems. Adopting such a model will not restrict RDBS from taking
full advantage of their search facilities.

<P>However, it seems that future trends might be toward hierarchical
properties. Therefore, DAV requirements [Slein et al.] stipulate
that the design of the flat property system MUST be such that it
will be possible to add true hierarchical properties later
without breaking downlevel clients. Specifically, a flat client
MUST be able to speak to a hierarchical server and a hierarchical
client MUST be able to speak to a flat server. Worst case either
way MUST be that the request fails.


<H4>2.2.2.3   Property Names</H4>

A property name identifies both the syntax and semantics of the
property's value. It is critical that property names do not
collide, e.g., two principals defining the same property name
with two different meanings.

<P>The URI framework provides a mechanism to prevent namespace
collision and for varying degrees of administrative control.
Rather than reinvent these desirable features, DAV properties
make use of them by requiring that all DAV property names MUST be
URIs.  Since a property is also an XML element, the name of the
XML element is a URI.

<P>The property namespace is flat, that is, it is not possible to
string together a series of property names in order to refer to a
hierarchy of properties. Thus it is possible to refer to a
property B but not a property A/B, where A is also a property
defined on the resource.

<P>Finally, it is not possible to define the same property twice as
this would cause a collision in the resource's property
namespace.


<h3>2.3  Schemas</h3>

A schema is a group of property names and XML elements.

<P>Schema discovery is used to determine if a system supports a
group of properties or XML elements. A property does not
necessarily contain sufficient information to identify any
schema(s) to which it may belong.

<P>As with property names, schemas MUST use URIs as their names.

<P>A resource declares its support for a schema by defining a
property whose name is the same as the schema's. The property
SHOULD contain the PropSchema XML element.


<h4>2.3.1     PropSchema XML Element</h4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropSchema
<BR>Purpose:  To provide information about properties
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Values=   [DTD] [DefinedProps]
<BR>Description:This property contains the definition of the schema.
This definition consists of two parts. A DTD element that
contains a DTD that declares all XML elements and DefinedProps
that defines any properties associated with the schema. As with
all XML it is possible to add extra XML elements. Therefore
schemas may define extra XML elements which are to be included
with their values.

<h4>2.3.2     DTD XML Element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/DTD
<BR>Purpose:  To contain the DTD for XML elements associated with the
schema.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Values:   XML Declaration statements


<h4>2.3.3     DefinedProps XML Element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/DefinedProps
<BR>Purpose:  To contain a list of properties defined by the schema.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Values=   1*PropEntries

<h4>2.3.4     PropEntries XML Element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropEntries
<BR>Purpose:  To contain the name of a defined property, the DTD of
its value, and its live/dead status.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   DefinedProps
<BR>Values=   Prop [DTD] [Live]
<BR>Description:Prop contains the name of the property. The DTD
contains the DTD of the property's value. Live, if defined,
indicates that the property has semantics and syntax that are
enforced by the server.


<h4>2.3.5     Live XML Element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/Live
<BR>Purpose:  If present this indicates the server MUST enforce the
syntax and semantics of the property.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   PropEntries


<h3>2.4  DAV Schema</h3>

The DAV Schema is specified as
http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/. This schema is used to
indicate support for
<LI>    properties that may be defined on a resource and
<LI>    XML elements that may be returned in responses.


<h4>2.4.1     DAV Property</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav
<BR>Purpose:  Defines support for the DAV schema and protocol.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Values=   PropSchema Level
<BR>Description:This property indicates that the resource supports
the DAV schema and protocol to the level indicated. THE VALUE IN
PROPSCHEMA IS TBD, WE NEED TO PROVIDE IT IN AN APPENDIX.


<h4>2.4.2     Level XML Element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/level
<BR>Purpose:  To indicate the level of DAV compliance the resource
meets.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   DAV
<BR>Values=   "1" | "2" | "3"
<BR>Description:A value of 1 for level indicates that the resource
supports the property and namespace sections of the DAV
specification. Level 2 indicates that the resource supports level
1 and the lock section of the specification, with a minimum
locking capability of the write lock. Level 3 indicates support
for levels 1 and 2 as well as support for the versioning section
of the DAV specification.


<h4>2.4.3     Prop XML element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/prop
<BR>Purpose:  Contains properties related to a resource.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Values:   XML Elements
<BR>Description:The Prop XML element is a generic container for
properties defined on resources. All elements inside Prop MUST
define properties related to the resource. No other elements may
be used inside of a Prop element.


<h4>2.4.4     PropLoc XML Attribute</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropLoc
<BR>Purpose:  To specify the location of the associated property.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Values=   URL
<BR>Description:This attribute is used with elements inside of Props
contained in responses to specify the URL of the property on the
associated resource. The PropLoc attribute MUST NOT be used in
requests.


<h4>2.4.5     Example</h4>

<PRE>&lt;?XML:Namespace href="http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/" AS="D"/&gt;
&lt;?XML:Namespace href="AIIM:Dublin:" AS="A"/&gt; &lt;D:Prop&gt;
     &lt;A:Author D:PropLoc="http://www.foo.com/resource/props/Author"&gt;
          Larry Masinter
     &lt;/A:Author&gt;
&lt;/D:Prop&gt;

</PRE>

The previous specifies that the property author exists on some
unspecified resource and that the property can be directly
referenced at http://www.foo.com/resource/props/Author. The
resource upon which the property is defined must be determined
from context.


<h3>2.5  Property Identifiers</h3>


<h4>2.5.1     Problem Definition</h4>

DAV properties are resources and thus may have a URI where the
value of an instance of the property may be retrieved.  This URI
is separate from the URI name of the property, which identifies
the syntax and semantics of the property, but which does not give
information on how to access the value of an instance of the
property.

<P>A server is free to assign whatever URI it chooses to identify an
instance of a property defined on a resource. In fact, a server
is free not to reveal the URI of an instance of a particular
resource and instead require that the client access the property
through <TT>PROPFIND</TT> and <TT>PROPPATCH</TT>.  However, many servers will want
to allow clients to directly manipulate properties. On these
servers, a client can discover the URI of an instance of a
property by performing a <TT>PROPFIND</TT> and examining the PropLoc
attribute, if returned, of each property.

<h3>2.6  Link XML Element</h3>

<h4>2.6.1     Problem Description</h4>

A mechanism is needed to associate resources with other
resources. These associations, known as links, consist of three
values, a type describing the nature of the association, the
source of the link, and the destination of the link. In the case
of annotation, neither the source nor the destination of a link
need be the resource upon which the link is recorded.


<h4>2.6.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The association mechanism MUST make use of the DAV property
mechanism in order to make the existence of the associations
searchable.


<h4>2.6.3     Link XML Element</h4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link
<BR>Purpose:  To identify a property as a link and to contain the
source and destination of that link.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Values=   1*Src 1*Dst
<BR>Description:Link is used to provide the sources and destinations
of a link. The type of the property containing the Link XML
element provides the type of the link. Link is a multi-valued
element, so multiple Links may be used together to indicate
multiple links with the same type.


<h4>2.6.4     Src XML Element</h4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/src
<BR>Purpose: To indicate the source of a link.
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link
<BR>Values= URI


<h4>2.6.5     Dst XML Element</h4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/Dst
<BR>Purpose: To indicate the destination of a link
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link
<BR>Values= URI


<h4>2.6.6     Example</h4>

<PRE>&lt;?XML:Namespace
     href = "http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/" AS = "D"/&gt;
&lt;?XML:Namespace
     href = "http://www.foocorp.com/Project/" AS = "F"/&gt;
&lt;D:Prop&gt;
     &lt;Source&gt;
          &lt;Link&gt;
               &lt;F:ProjFiles&gt;Source&lt;/F:ProjFiles&gt;
               &lt;src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/src&gt;
               &lt;dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/main.c&lt;/dst&gt;
          &lt;/Link&gt;
          &lt;Link&gt;
               &lt;F:ProjFiles&gt;Library&lt;/F:ProjFiles&gt;
               &lt;src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/src&gt;
               &lt;dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/main.lib&lt;/dst&gt;
          &lt;/Link&gt;
          &lt;Link&gt;
               &lt;F:ProjFiles&gt;Makefile&lt;/F:ProjFiles&gt;
               &lt;src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/src&gt;
               &lt;dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/makefile&lt;/dst&gt;
     &lt;Link&gt;
     &lt;/Source&gt;
&lt;/D:Prop&gt;

</PRE>

In this example the resource http://foo.bar/program has a source
property defined which contains three links. Each link contains
three elements, two of which, src and dst, are part of the DAV
schema defined in this document, and one which is defined by the
schema http://www.foocorp.com/project/ (Source, Library, and
Makefile). A client which only implements the elements in the DAV
spec will not understand the foocorp elements and will ignore
them, thus seeing the expected source and destination links. An
enhanced client may know about the foocorp elements and be able
to present the user with additional information about the links.


<h3>2.7  Multi-Status Response</h3>


<h4>2.7.1     Problem Definition</h4>

Some methods effect more than one resource. The effect of the
method on each of the scoped resources may be different, as such
a return format that can specify the effect of the method on each
resource is needed.


<h4>2.7.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution must:
<LI> communicate the status code and reason
<LI> give the URI of the resource on which the method was invoked
<LI> be consistent with other return body formats

<h4>2.7.3     Multi-Status Response</h4>

The default multi-status response body is an <TT>text/xml</TT> HTTP entity
that contains a single XML element called <TT>multiresponse</TT>, which
contains a set of XML elements called response, one for each 200,
300, 400, and 500 series status code generated during the method
invocation.  100 series status codes MUST NOT be recorded in a
response XML element.


<H4>2.7.3.1   <TT>Multiresponse</TT></H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/multiresponse
<BR>Purpose:  Contains multiple response messages.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Value:    1*Response [ResponseDescription]
<BR>Description:The ResponseDescription at the top level is used to
provide a general message describing the over arching nature of
the response. If this value is available an application MAY use
it instead of presenting the individual response descriptions
contain within the responses.
<H4>2.7.3.2   Response</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/response
<BR>Purpose:  Holds a single response
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Value:    (Prop | HREF) Status [ResponseDescription]
<BR>Description: Prop MUST contain one or more empty XML elements
representing the name of properties. Multiple properties may be
included if the same response applies to them all. If HREF is
used then the response refers to a problem with the referenced
resource, not a property.


<H4>2.7.3.3   Status</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/status
<BR>Purpose:  Holds a single HTTP status-line
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Response
<BR>Value:    status-line   ;status-line defined in [Fielding et al.,
1997]


<H4>2.7.3.4   ResponseDescription</H4>

Name:
http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/ResponseDescription
<BR>Purpose:  Contains a message that can be displayed to the user
explaining the nature of the response.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   <TT>Multiresponse</TT> and/or Response
<BR>Value:    Any
<BR>Description:   This XML element provides information suitable to
be presented to a user.


<h3>2.8  Properties and Methods</h3>


<h4>2.8.1     DELETE</h4>

As properties are resources, the deletion of a property causes
the same result as the deletion of any resource. It is worth
pointing out that the deletion of a property effects both direct
manipulation, that is by the property's URL, as well as indirect
discovery and manipulation, that is <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> and <TT>PROPFIND</TT>.


<h4>2.8.2     GET</h4>

A <TT>GET</TT> with a Request-URI that identifies a property returns the
name and value of that property.  Accept types may be used to
specify the format of the return value, but all DAV compliant
servers MUST at minimum support a return type of <TT>text/xml</TT>. If
<TT>text/xml</TT> is used as the response format then it MUST return the
name and value of the property using the <TT>Prop</TT> XML element.


<H4>2.8.2.1   Example</H4>

The following example assumes that the property's URL, originally
generated by the server, was discovered by examining the <TT>proploc</TT>
XML attribute returned on a result from a <TT>FINDPROP</TT>.
<PRE>

     &lt;/Z:Authors&gt;
&lt;/D:prop&gt;

</PRE>


<h4>2.8.3     <TT>PROPPATCH</TT></h4>

The <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> method processes instructions specified in the
request body to create and/or remove properties defined on the
resource identified by Request-URI.

<P>All DAV compliant servers MUST process instructions which are
specified using the <TT>PropertyUpdate</TT>, <TT>Create</TT>, and <TT>Remove</TT> XML
elements of the DAV schema.  The request message body MUST
contain at least one <TT>PropertyUpdate</TT> XML element.  Instruction
processing MUST occur in the order instructions are received
(i.e., from top to bottom), and MUST be performed atomically.


<H4>2.8.3.1   PropertyUpdate XML element</H4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropertyUpdate
<BR>Purpose:  To contain a request to alter the properties on a
resource.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Values=   *(<TT>Create</TT> | <TT>Remove</TT>)
<BR>Description:This XML element is a container for the information
required to modify the properties on the resource. This XML
element is multi-valued.


<H4>2.8.3.2   <TT>Create</TT> XML element</H4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/create
<BR>Purpose:  To create the DAV properties specified inside the
<TT>Create</TT> XML element.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropertyUpdate
<BR>Values=   Prop
<BR>Description:This XML element MUST contain only a <TT>Prop</TT> XML
element. The elements contained by <TT>Prop</TT> specify the name and
value of properties that are created on Request-URI. If a
property already exists then its value is replaced. The <TT>Prop</TT> XML
element MUST NOT contain a PropLoc XML attribute.


<H4>2.8.3.3   <TT>Remove</TT> XML element</H4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/remove
<BR>Purpose:  To remove the DAV properties specified inside the
<TT>Remove</TT> XML element.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropertyUpdate
<BR>Values=   Prop
<BR>Description:<TT>Remove</TT> specifies that the properties specified in
<TT>Prop</TT> should be removed. Specifying the removal of a property that
does not exist is not an error. All the elements in <TT>Prop</TT> MUST be
empty, as only the names of properties to be removed are
required.


<H4>2.8.3.4   Response</H4>

The response MUST have a response body that contains a
<TT>multiresponse</TT> identifying the results for each property.


<H4>2.8.3.5   Response Codes</H4>

<LI>200 OK - The command succeeded. As there can be a mixture of
<TT>Create</TT> and <TT>Remove</TT>s in a body, a 201 Create seems inappropriate.
<LI>403 Forbidden - The client, for reasons the server chooses not to
specify, can not alter one of the properties.
<LI>405 Conflict - The client has provided a value whose semantics
are not appropriate for the property. This includes trying to set
read only properties.
<LI>413 Request Entity Too Long - If a particular property is too
long to be recorded then a composite XML error will be returned
indicating the offending property.
<LI>417 Insufficient Space on Resource - The resource does not have
sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the
execution of this method.
<LI>418 Atomicity Failure - The command was not executed because of
an atomicity failure elsewhere the caused the entire command to
be aborted.

</PRE>


<h4>2.8.4     PUT</h4>

A <TT>PUT</TT> is specified in order to control what is returned by a <TT>GET</TT>.
However a <TT>GET</TT> on a property always returns a predefined property
containment format. Therefore <TT>PUT</TT> can not be used if the Request-URI refers to a property.


<h4>2.8.5     PROPFIND</h4>

The <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method retrieves properties defined on Request-URI.
The request message body is an XML document that MUST contain
only one <TT>PropFind</TT> XML element, which specifies the type of
property find action to be performed.  The XML element contained
by <TT>PropFind</TT> specifies the type of action to be performed:
retrieve all property names and values (<TT>Allprop</TT>), retrieve only
specified property names and values (Prop), or retrieve only a
list of all property names (Propname).  When a <TT>Prop</TT> XML element
is present, it specifies a list of the names of properties whose
name and value are to be returned.  The <TT>Prop</TT> element, when used
within a <TT>FINDPROP</TT> request body MUST be empty.

<P>The response is a <TT>text/xml</TT> message body that contains a
<TT>Multiresponse</TT> XML element which describes the results of the
attempts to retrieve the various properties. If a property was
successfully retrieved then its value MUST be returned in the
<TT>Prop</TT> XML element. In the case of <TT>Allprop</TT> and <TT>Findprop</TT>, if a
principal does not have the right to know if a particular
property exists, an error MUST NOT be returned. The results of
this method SHOULD NOT be cached.


<H4>2.8.5.1   <TT>PropFind</TT> XML element</H4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/Propfind

<h2>3    A Proposal for Collections of Web Resources and Name Space   Operations</h2>

<h3>3.1  Observations on the HTTP Object Model</h3>

This section provides a description of a new type of Web
resource, the collection, and discusses its interactions with the
HTTP URL namespace.  This discussion is a prerequisite for the
specification of methods that operate on collections, given later
in this document.


<h4>3.1.1     Collection Resources</h4>

A collection is a resource whose state consists of a list of
internal members, a list of external members, and a set of
properties.  An internal member resource MUST have a URI that is
immediately relative to the base URI of the collection, that is,
a relative URI in which "../" is illegal, which must begin with
"./" and which MAY contain only one other "/" at the end of the
URI. An external member resource MUST be an absolute URI that is
not an internal URI.  Any given internal or external URI MUST
only belong to the collection once, i.e., multiple instances of
URIs in a collection are illegal.  Properties defined on
collections have no special distinction, and behave exactly as do
properties on non-collection resources.

<P>The purpose of a collection resource is to model collection-like
objects (e.g., a filesystem directory) within a server's
namespace.  Once these objects have been modeled with
collections, a client may perform an <TT>INDEX</TT>, add and remove
external members using <TT>ADDREF</TT> and <TT>DELREF</TT>, and perform recursive
operations, such as a full hierarchy copy.

<P>To support methods which operate on collections, a server SHOULD
model its collection-like objects with collection resources.  For
example, a server which is implemented on top of a filesystem
SHOULD treat all filesystem directories exposed by the server as
collection resources.


<h4>3.1.2     Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources</h4>

This document specifies the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method to create new collection
resources, and the <TT>INDEX</TT> method to list their contents.

<P>In HTTP/1.1, the <TT>PUT</TT> method is defined to store the request body
at the location specified by Request-URI.  While a description
format for a collection can readily be constructed that could be
used with <TT>PUT</TT>, the implications of sending such a description to
the server are undesirable.  For example, if a description of a
collection that omitted some existing resources were <TT>PUT</TT> to a
server, this might be interpreted as a command to remove those
members.  This would extend <TT>PUT</TT> to perform <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality,
which is undesirable since it changes the semantics of <TT>PUT</TT>, and
makes it difficult to control <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality with an access
control scheme based on methods.

<P>While the <TT>POST</TT> method is sufficiently open-ended that a "create a
collection" <TT>POST</TT> command could be constructed, this is
undesirable because it would be difficult to separate access
control for collection creation from other uses of <TT>POST</TT> if they
both use the same method.

<P>While it might seem desirable to have <TT>GET</TT> return a listing of the
members of a collection, this is foiled by the existence of the
"index.html" de-facto standard namespace redirection, in which a
<TT>GET</TT> request on a collection is automatically redirected to the
index.html resource.

<P>The exact definition of the behavior of <TT>GET</TT> and <TT>PUT</TT> on
collections is defined later in this document.


<H4>3.1.2.1   Example</H4>

The structured resource http://foo/bar is created with a <TT>PUT</TT>. Bar
is a multipart/related file with two members http://foo/bar/a and
http://foo/bar/b. If bar were deleted then both a and b would
also be deleted since they are all really just one resource. If
http://foo/bar/a/c was <TT>PUT</TT> then a <TT>DELETE</TT> on http://foo/bar/a
would also delete http://foo/bar/a/c as c was created with a <TT>PUT</TT>
not a <TT>MKCOL</TT>.

<P>If http://foo/bar/b/d is created with a <TT>MKCOL</TT> and
http://foo/bar/b/d/e was created then a <TT>DELETE</TT> on d would fail
because d is a collection with an internal member. However the
existence of the collection d is something of an illusion. If a
<TT>DELETE</TT> was executed on http://foo/bar then everything would be
deleted, even though http://foo/bar/b/d was created with a <TT>MKCOL</TT>.

<P>Thus the effect of a <TT>MKCOL</TT> within a composite resource's
namespace is felt on its children, not its ancestors. The
children of d MUST be treated as members of a collection when a
method is executed on d. But a method executed on b or a is
treated as if there only existed a non-collection resource.

<h4>3.1.3     Source Resources and Output Resources</h4>

For many resources, the entity returned by <TT>GET</TT> exactly matches
the persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF file
stored on a disk.  For this simple case, the URL at which a
resource is accessed is identical to the URL at which the source
(the persistent state) of the resource is accessed. This is also
the case for HTML source files that are not processed by the
server prior to transmission.

<P>However, the server can sometimes process HTML resources before
they are transmitted as a return entity body. For example,
server-side-include directives within an HTML file instruct a
server to replace the directive with another value, such as the
current date.  In this case, what is returned by <TT>GET</TT> (HTML plus
date) differs from the persistent state of the resource (HTML
plus directive). Typically there is no way to access the HTML
resource containing the unprocessed directive.

<P>Sometimes the entity returned by <TT>GET</TT> is the output of a data-producing process that is described by one or more source
resources (that may not even have a location in the URL
namespace).  A single data-producing process may dynamically
generate the state of a potentially large number of output
resources. An example of this is a CGI script that describes a
"finger" gateway process that maps part of the namespace of a
server into finger requests, such as
http://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.

<P>In the absence of distributed authoring capability, it is
acceptable to have no mapping of source resource(s) to the URI
namespace, and in fact has desirable security benefits. However,
if remote editing of the source resource(s) is desired, the
source resource(s) should be given a location in the URI
namespace. This source location should not be one of the
locations at which the generated output is retrievable, since in
general it is impossible for the server to differentiate requests
for source resources from requests for process output resources.
There is often a many-to-many relationship between source
resources and output resources.

<P>For DAV compliant servers all output resources which have a
single source resource (and that source resource has a URI), the
URI of the source resource SHOULD be stored in a single link on
the output resource with type
http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/source. Note that by storing
the source URI in links on the output resources, the burden of
discovering the source is placed on the authoring client.


<h3>3.2  <TT>MKCOL</TT> Method</h3>


<h4>3.2.1     Problem Description</h4>

A client must be able to create a collection.


<h4>3.2.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution must ensure that a collection has been made (i.e.
that it responds to the <TT>INDEX</TT> method) as opposed to a non-collection resource. If a collection could not be made, it must
indicate this failure to the user-agent.


<h4>3.2.3     Request</h4>

<TT>MKCOL</TT> creates a new collection resource at the location specified
by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI exists, then <TT>MKCOL</TT> must
fail. During <TT>MKCOL</TT> processing, a server MUST make the Request-URI
a member of its parent collection. If no such an ancestor exists,
the method MUST fail. When the <TT>MKCOL</TT> operation creates a new
collection resource, all ancestors MUST already exist, or the
method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example,
if a request to create collection <TT>/a/b/c/d/</TT> is made, and neither
<TT>/a/b/</TT> nor <TT>/a/b/c/</TT> exist, the request MUST fail.


<H4>3.2.3.1   MKCOL Without Request Body</H4>

When <TT>MKCOL</TT> is invoked without a request body, the newly created
collection has no members.


<H4>3.2.3.2   MKCOL With Request Body</H4>

A <TT>MKCOL</TT> request message MAY contain a message body.  The behavior
of a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request when the body is present is limited to
creating collections, members of a collection, bodies of members
and properties on the collections or members. If the server
receives a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request entity type it does not support or
understand it MUST respond with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type)
status code.  The exact behavior of <TT>MKCOL</TT> for various request
media types is undefined in this document, and will be specified
in separate documents.


<h4>3.2.4     Response</h4>

Responses from a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request are not cacheable, since <TT>MKCOL</TT> has
non-idempotent semantics.
<LI>201 (Created) - The collection or structured resource was created
in its entirety.
<LI>403 (Forbidden) - This indicates at least one of two conditions:
1) The server does not allow the creation of collections at the
given location in its namespace, and 2) The parent collection of
the Request-URI exists but cannot accept members.
<LI>409 (Conflict) - A collection cannot be made at the Request-URI
until one or more intermediate collections have been created.

<LI> 415 (Unsupported Media Type)- The server does not support the
request type of the body.
<LI>417 (Insufficient Space on Resource) - The resource does not have
sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the
execution of this method.


<h4>3.2.5     Example</h4>

This example creates a container collection called
/webdisc/xfiles/ on the server www.server.org.
<PRE>
     MKCOL /webdisc/xfiles/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.server.org

header is available, this element MUST NOT be defined.


<h3>3.4  INDEX Method</h3>


<h4>3.4.1     Problem Description</h4>

A mechanism is needed to discover if a resource is a collection
and if so, list its members.


<h4>3.4.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution:
<LI> must allow a client to discover the members of a collection
<LI> must always provide a machine-readable description of the
  membership of a collection
<LI> must be leveraged as a more general mechanism to provide a
  list of contents for any resource which can profitably return a
  membership like listing.


<h4>3.4.3     The Request</h4>

The <TT>INDEX</TT> method returns a machine-readable representation of the
membership of the resource at the Request-URI.

<P>For a collection, <TT>INDEX</TT> MUST return a list of its members. All
WebDAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>text/xml</TT> response
entity described below.  The <TT>INDEX</TT> result for a collection MAY
also return a list of the members of child collections, to any
depth.

<P>Collections that respond to an <TT>INDEX</TT> method with a <TT>text/xml</TT>
entity MUST contain only one ResInfo element.  This ResInfo
element contains an Href element, which gives the identifier(s)
of the resource, a <TT>Prop</TT> element, which gives selected properties
of the resource, and a Members element, which contains a ResInfo
element for each member of the collection.  The <TT>Prop</TT> element MUST
contain at least the following properties, if they are defined
and available: DisplayName, IsCollection, CreationDate,
GETentity, and INDEXentity.

<P>The response from <TT>INDEX</TT> is cacheable, and SHOULD be accompanied
by an ETag header (see section 13.3.4 of RFC 2068). If <TT>GET</TT> and
<TT>INDEX</TT> return different entities for the same resource state, they
MUST return different entity tags.


<h4>3.4.4     The Response</h4>

<LI>200 (OK) - The server MUST send a machine readable response
entity which describes the membership of the resource.


<h4>3.4.5     ResInfo XML Element</h4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/resinfo
<BR>Purpose:  Describes a resource.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Value:    Href <TT>Prop</TT> Members
<BR>Description: There MUST be at least one Href element.  Each Href
element contains a URI for the resource, which MUST be an
absolute URI. There MUST be a single <TT>Prop</TT> element that contains a
series of properties defined on the resource.  If the resource is
a collection, it MAY have at most one Members element, which
describes the members of the collection.


<h4>3.4.6     Members XML Element</h4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/members
<BR>Purpose:  Describes the membership of a collection resource.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   ResInfo
<BR>Value:    ResInfo
<BR>Description: Contains zero or more ResInfo elements, which
describe members of the collection.


<h4>3.4.7     Href XML Element</h4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/href
<BR>Purpose:  To identify that the content of the element is a URI.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent:   Any
<BR>Value:    URI ; See section 3.2.1 of [Fielding et al., 1997]

This example shows the result of the <TT>INDEX</TT> method applied to the
collection resource
http://www.microsoft.com/user/yarong/dav_drafts/.  It returns a
response body in XML format, which gives information about the
container and its sole member,
http://www.microsoft.com/user/yarong/dav_drafts/base. The entry
on the collection confirms that the resource the <TT>INDEX</TT> was
executed on is a collection. The result also contains the URI of
the IsCollection property on the member resource.


<h3>3.5  Behavior of RFC 2068 Methods on Collections</h3>

With the introduction of the collection resource type to the HTTP
object model, it is necessary to define the behavior of the
existing methods (defined in RFC 2068) when invoked on a
collection resource to avoid ambiguity.  While some methods, such
as <TT>OPTIONS</TT> and <TT>TRACE</TT> behave identically when applied to
collections, <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT>, <TT>POST</TT>, <TT>PUT</TT>, and <TT>DELETE</TT> require some
additional explanation.


<h4>3.5.1     <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT> for Collections</h4>

The semantics of <TT>GET</TT> are unchanged when applied to a collection,
since <TT>GET</TT> is defined as, "retrieve whatever information (in the
form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI" [Fielding et
al., 1997]. <TT>GET</TT> when applied to a collection MAY return the
contents of an "index.html" resource, a human-readable view of
the contents of the collection, or something else altogether, and
hence it is possible the result of a <TT>GET</TT> on a collection will
bear no correlation to the state of the collection.

<P>Similarly, since the definition of <TT>HEAD</TT> is a <TT>GET</TT> without a
response message body, the semantics of <TT>HEAD</TT> are unmodified when
applied to collection resources.


<h4>3.5.2     <tt>POST</tt> for Collections</h4>

Since by definition the actual function performed by <TT>POST</TT> is
determined by the server and often depends on the particular
resource, the behavior of <TT>POST</TT> when applied to collections cannot
be meaningfully modified because it is largely undefined.  Thus
the semantics of <TT>POST</TT> are unmodified when applied to a
collection.


<h4>3.5.3     <TT>PUT</TT> for Collections</h4>

As defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification [Fielding et al., 1997],
the "<TT>PUT</TT> method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under
the supplied Request-URI."  Since submission of an entity
representing a collection would implicitly encode creation and
deletion of resources, this specification intentionally does not
define a transmission format for creating a collection using <TT>PUT</TT>.
Instead, the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method is defined to create collections.  If a
<TT>PUT</TT> is invoked on a collection resource it MUST fail.

<P>When the <TT>PUT</TT> operation creates a new non-collection resource all
ancestors MUST already exist.  If all ancestors do not exist, the
method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example,
if resource /a/b/c/d.html is to be created and /a/b/c/ does not
exist, then the request MUST fail.


<H4>3.5.3.1   <TT>PUT</TT> for Non-Collection Resources</H4>

A <TT>PUT</TT> performed on an existing resource replaces the <TT>GET</TT> response
entity of the resource, but MUST NOT change the value of any dead
properties defined on the resource.  Live properties defined on
the resource MAY be recomputed during <TT>PUT</TT> processing.


<h4>3.5.4     DELETE for Collections</h4>

When <TT>DELETE</TT> is applied to a collection without internal members
the collection resource, along with its properties, and external
members, MUST be deleted.  A <TT>DELETE</TT> method applied to a
collection resource containing internal member resources MUST
fail with a 409 Conflict status code.


<h4>3.5.5     DELETE Method for Non-Collection Resources</h4>

If the <TT>DELETE</TT> method is issued to a non-collection resource which
is an internal member of a collection, then during <TT>DELETE</TT>
processing a server MUST remove the Request-URI from its parent
collection. A server MAY remove the URI of a deleted resource
from any collections of which the resource is an external member.


<h3>3.6  COPY Method</h3>


<h4>3.6.1     Problem Description</h4>

Currently, in order to create a copy of a resource, the client
must <TT>GET</TT> an entity and then <TT>PUT</TT> that entity to the desired
destination. This requires (1) an entity to be transmitted to and
from the server and (2) that the resource be expressible as an
entity with complete fidelity.

<P>This is problematic because of the network traffic involved in
making a copy, and because there is often no way to fully express
a resource as an entity without a loss of fidelity.


<h4>3.6.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution:
<LI> MUST allow a principal to create a copy of a resource
  without having to transmit the resource to and from the server.


<h4>3.6.3     The Request</h4>

The <TT>COPY</TT> method creates a duplicate of the source resource, given
by the Request-URI, in the destination resource, given by the
Destination header.  The Destination header MUST be present.  The
exact behavior of the <TT>COPY</TT> method depends on the type of the
source resource.


<H4>3.6.3.1   COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources</H4>

When the source resource is not a collection, and is not a
property, the body of the destination resource MUST be octet-for-octet identical to the body of the source resource. Alterations
to the destination resource do not modify the source resource.
Alterations to the source resource do not modify the destination
resource. Thus, all copies are performed "by-value".

<P>All properties on the source resource MUST be duplicated on the
destination resource, subject to modifying headers, following the
definition for copying properties.

<H4>3.6.3.2   COPY for Properties</H4>

The following section defines how properties on a resource are
handled during a <TT>COPY</TT> operation.
Live properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live
properties at the destination resource. Since they are live
properties, the server determines the syntax and semantics (hence
value) of these properties.  Properties named by the Enforce-Live-Properties header MUST be live on the destination resource, or
the method MUST fail.  If a property is not named by Enforce-Live-Properties and cannot be copied live, then its value MUST be
duplicated, octet-for-octet, in an identically named, dead
resource on the destination resource.

<P>If a property on the source already exists on the resource and
the overwrite header is set to TRUE then the property at the
destination MUST be overwritten with the property from the
source. If the overwrite header is false and the previous
situation exists then the <TT>COPY</TT> MUST fail with a 409 Conflict.


<H4>3.6.3.3   COPY for Collections</H4>

A <TT>COPY</TT> on a collection causes a new, empty collection resource to
be created at the destination with the same properties as the
source resource.  All properties on the source collection MUST be
duplicated on the destination collection, subject to modifying
headers, following the definition for copying properties.  The
new collection MUST NOT contain any members, internal or
external.


<H4>3.6.3.4   Type Interactions</H4>

If the destination resource identifies a property and the source
resource is not a property, then the copy SHOULD fail.

<P>If the destination resource identifies a collection and the
Overwrite header is "true," prior to performing the copy, the
server MUST perform a <TT>DELETE</TT> operation on the collection.


<h4>3.6.4     The Response</h4>

<LI>200 (OK) The source resource was successfully copied to a pre-existing destination resource.

<LI>201 (Created) The source resource was successfully copied.  The
copy operation resulted in the creation of a new resource.

<LI>412 (Precondition Failed) This status code MUST be returned if
the server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties
listed in the Enforce-Live-Properties header, or if the Overwrite
header is false, and the state of the destination resource is
non-null.

<LI>417 (Insufficient Space on Resource) - The destination resource
does not have sufficient space to record the state of the
resource after the execution of this method.

<LI>500 (Server Error) The resource was in such a state that it could
not be copied. This may occur if the Destination header specifies
a resource that is outside the namespace the resource is able to
interact with.

<h4>3.6.5     Examples</h4>


<H4>3.6.5.1   Overwrite Example</H4>

This example shows resource
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being copied to the
location http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html.  The
contents of the destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.

<PRE>COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>

<H4>3.6.5.2   No Overwrite Example</H4>

The following example shows the same copy operation being
performed, except with the Overwrite header set to "false."  A
response of 412, Precondition Failed, is returned because the
destination resource has a non-null state.

<PRE>COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu

<h3>3.7  MOVE Method</h3>

<h4>3.7.1     Problem Description</h4>

The move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a
copy followed by a delete, where the actions are performed
atomically.  Using RFC 2068 methods only, this procedure could be
performed in several steps. First, the client could issue a <TT>GET</TT>
to retrieve a representation of a resource, issue a <TT>DELETE</TT> to
remove the resource from the server, then use <TT>PUT</TT> to place the
resource on the server with a new URI. As is the case for <TT>COPY</TT> -
because of the network traffic involved in making a move, and
because there is often no way to fully express a resource as an
entity without a loss of fidelity - server move functionality is
preferable.

<P>With a WEBDAV server, a principal may accomplish this task by
issuing a <TT>COPY</TT> and then <TT>DELETE</TT>. Network load decreases, but the
server load may still be significant because the server must
create a duplicate resource. Were a server to know beforehand
that a principal intended to perform <TT>COPY</TT> and <TT>DELETE</TT> operations
in succession, it could avoid the creation of a duplicate
resource.

<h4>3.7.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution:
<LI> Must prevent the unneeded transfer of entity bodies from and
  to the server.
<LI> Must prevent the unneeded creation of copies by the server.

<h4>3.7.3     The Request</h4>

The move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a
copy followed by a delete, where the actions are performed
atomically. If a resource exists at the destination, the
destination resource will be DELETEd as a side effect of the <TT>MOVE</TT>
operation, subject to the restrictions of the overwrite header.

<h4>3.7.4     The Response</h4>

<LI>200 (OK) - The resource was moved. A successful response must
contain the Content-Location header, set equal to the URI in
source. This lets caches properly flush any cached entries for
the source. Unfortunately the Content-Location header only allows
a single value so it is not possible for caches unfamiliar with
the <TT>MOVE</TT> method to properly clear their caches.

<LI>412 (Precondition Failed) This status code MUST be returned if
the server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties
listed in the Enforce-Live-Properties header, or if the Overwrite
header is false, and the state of the destination resource is
non-null.

<LI>501 (Not Implemented) - This may occur if the Destination header
specifies a resource which is outside its domain of control
(e.g., stored on another server) resource and the server either
refuses or is incapable of moving to an external resource.

<LI>502 (Bad Gateway) - This may occur when moving to external
resources and the destination server refused to accept the
resource.


<h4>3.7.5     Examples</h4>


<H4>3.7.5.1   Overwrite Example</H4>

This example shows resource
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being moved to the
location http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html.  The
contents of the destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.

<h3>3.8  <TT>ADDREF</TT> Method</h3>

<h4>3.8.1     Problem Definition</h4>

There needs to be a way to add an external member to a
collection.

<h4>3.8.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution must:
<LI>    allow access control
<LI>    allow referencing to URIs of external members
<LI>    not require a body


<h4>3.8.3     The Request</h4>

The <TT>ADDREF</TT> method adds the URI specified in the Collection-Member
header as an external member to the collection specified by the
Request-URI. The value in the Collection-Member header MUST be an
absolute URI meeting the requirements of an external member URI.

<P>It is not an error if the URI specified in the Collection-Member
header already exists as an external member of the collection,
however, after processing <TT>ADDREF</TT> there MUST be only one instance
of the URI in the collection.  If the URI specified in the
Collection-Member header already exists as an internal member of
the collection, the <TT>ADDREF</TT> method MUST fail with a 412
Precondition Failed status code.


<h4>3.8.4     Example</h4>

<PRE>ADDREF /~whitehead/dav/ HTTP/1.1

<h3>3.9  DELREF Method</h3>


<h4>3.9.1     Problem Definition</h4>

There needs to be a way to remove an external member from a
collection.


<h4>3.9.2     Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution must:
<LI> allow access control
<LI> allow referencing to URIs of external members
<LI> not require a body


<h4>3.9.3     The Request</h4>

The <TT>DELREF</TT> method removes the URI specified in the Collection-Member header from the collection specified by the Request-URI.
DELREFing a URI which is not a member of the collection is not an
error. DELREFing an internal member MUST fail with a 412
Precondition Failed status code.


<h4>3.9.4     Example</h4>

Host: www.ics.udi.edu
Collection-Member: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<h3>3.10 PATCH Method</h3>

<h4>3.10.1    Problem Definition</h4>

At present, if a principal wishes to modify a resource, they must
issue a <TT>GET</TT> against the resource, modify their local copy of the
resource, and then issue a <TT>PUT</TT> to place the modified resource on
the server. This procedure is inefficient because the entire
entity for a resource must be transmitted to and from the server
in order to make even small changes.  Ideally, the update entity
transmitted to the server should be proportional in size to the
modifications.


<h4>3.10.2    Solution Requirements</h4>

The solution must:
<LI>    allow partial modification of a resource without having to
     transmit the entire modified resource
<LI>    allow byte-range patching
<LI>    allows extensions so that patches can be done beyond simple
     byte-range patching
<LI>    allow ranges to be deleted, inserted, and replaced


<h4>3.10.3    The Request</h4>

The request entity of the <TT>PATCH</TT> method contains a list of
differences between the resource identified by the Request-URI
and the desired content of the resource after the <TT>PATCH</TT> action
has been applied.  The list of differences is in a format defined
by the media type of the entity (e.g., "application/diff") and
must include sufficient information to allow the server to
convert the original version of the resource to the desired
version.  Processing performed by <TT>PATCH</TT> is atomic, hence all
changes MUST be successfully executed or the method fails. <TT>PATCH</TT>
MUST fail if executed on a non-existent resource; i.e. <TT>PATCH</TT> does
not create a resource as a side effect.

<P>If the request appears (at least initially) to be acceptable, the
server MUST transmit an interim 100 response message after
receiving the empty line terminating the request headers and
continue processing the request.  Since the semantics of <TT>PATCH</TT>
are non-idempotent, responses to this method are not cacheable.

<P>While server support for <TT>PATCH</TT> is optional, if a server does
support <TT>PATCH</TT>, it MUST support at least the <TT>text/xml</TT> diff format
defined below.  Support for the VTML difference format [VTML] is
recommended, but not required.

<h4>3.10.4    <TT>text/xml</TT> elements for <TT>PATCH</TT></h4>

The <TT>resourceupdate</TT> XML element contains a set of XML sub-entities
that describe modification operations.  The name and meaning of
these XML elements is given below. Processing of these directives
MUST be performed in the order encountered within the XML
document.  A directive operates on the resource as modified by
all previous directives (executed in sequential order). The
length of the resource MAY be extended or reduced by a <TT>PATCH</TT>.

<P>The changes specified by the <TT>resourceupdate</TT> XML element MUST be
executed atomically.


<H4>3.10.4.1  <TT>ResourceUpdate</TT></H4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/resourceupdate
<BR>Purpose:       Contains an ordered set of changes to a non-collection, non-property resource.
<BR>Schema:        http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>Parent:        Any
<BR>Value:         *(<TT>Insert</TT> | <TT>Delete</TT> | <TT>Replace</TT>)


<H4>3.10.4.2  <TT>Insert</TT></H4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/insert
<BR>Purpose:       Insert the XML element's contents starting at the
specified octet.
<BR>Schema:        http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>Parent:        <TT>ResourceUpdate</TT>
<BR>Value:         The insert XML element MUST contain an <TT>Octet-Range</TT>
XML element that specifies an octet position within the body of a
resource.  A value of "end" specifies the end of the resource.
The body of the insert XML element contains the octets to be
inserted.

<P>Please note that in order to protect the white space contained in
this XML element the following attribute/value MUST be included
in the element: XML-SPACE = "PRESERVE".


<H4>3.10.4.3  <TT>Delete</TT></H4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/delete
<BR>Purpose:       Removes the specified range of octets.
<BR>Schema:        http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>Parent:        <TT>ResourceUpdate</TT>
<BR>Value:         The <TT>Delete</TT> XML element MUST contain an octet-range
XML element.

<BR>Discussion: The octets that are deleted are removed, which means
the resource is collapsed and the length of the resource is
decremented by the size of the octet range.  It is not
appropriate to replace deleted octets with zeroed-out octets,
since zero is a valid octet value.


<H4>3.10.4.4  <TT>Replace</TT></H4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/replace
<BR>Purpose:       Replaces the specified range of octets with the
contents of the XML element.  If the number of octets in the XML
element is different from the number of octets specified, the
update MUST be rejected.
<BR>Schema:        http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>Parent:        ResourceUpdate
<BR>Value:         The Replace XML element MUST contain an <TT>octet-range</TT> XML element. The contents of the entity are the replacement
octets.

<P>Please note that in order to protect the white space contained in
this XML element the following attribute/value MUST be included
in the element: XML-SPACE = "PRESERVE".


<H4>3.10.4.5  <TT>Octet-Range</TT> Attribute</H4>

Name:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/octet-range
<BR>Purpose:  Specifies a range of octets that the enclosing property
effects.
<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/
<BR>Parent:   <TT>Insert</TT>, <TT>Delete</TT>, <TT>Replace</TT>
<BR>Value:    number ["-" (number | "end")]
          Number = 1*Digit

<BR>Description: Octet numbering begins with 0. If the octet contains
a single number then the operation is to begin at that octet and
to continue for a length specified by the operation. In the case
of a delete, this would mean to delete a single octet. In the
case of an insert this would mean to begin the insertion at the
specified octet and to continue for the length of the included
value, extending the resource if necessary. In the case of
replace, the replace begins at the specified octet and overwrites
all that follow to the length of the included value.


<h4>3.10.5    The Response</h4>

<LI>200 (OK) - The request entity body was processed without error,
resulting in an update to the state of the resource.

<LI>409 (Conflict) - If the update information in the request message
body does not make sense given the current state of the resource
(e.g., an instruction to delete a non-existent line), this status
code MAY be returned.

<LI>415 (Unsupported Media Type) - The server does not support the
content type of the update instructions in the request message
body.

<LI>416 (Unprocessable Entity) - A new status code.  The server
understands the content type of the request entity, but was
unable to process the contained instructions.

<LI>417 (Insufficient Space on Resource) - The resource does not have
sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the
execution of this method.

<h3>3.11 Headers</h3>

<h4>3.11.1    Destination Header</h4>

The Destination header specifies a destination resource for
methods such as <TT>COPY</TT> and <TT>MOVE</TT>, which take two URIs as parameters.
<PRE>     Destination= "Destination" ":" URI
</PRE>


<h4>3.11.2    Enforce-Live-Properties Header</h4>

The Enforce-Live-Properties header specifies properties that MUST
be "live" after they are copied (moved) to the destination
resource of a copy (or move). If the value "*" is given for the
header, then it designates all live properties on the source
resource.  If the value is "Omit" then the server MUST NOT
duplicate on the destination resource any properties that are
defined on the source resource. If this header is not included
then the server is expected to act as defined by the default
property handling behavior of the associated method.

<PRE>     EnforceLiveProperties = "Enforce-Live-Properties" ":" ("*" |
     "Omit" | 1#(Property-Name))
     Property-Name = "&lt;" URI "&gt;"
</PRE>

<h4>3.11.3    Overwrite Header</h4>

The Overwrite header specifies whether the server should
overwrite the state of a non-null destination resource during a
<TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.  A value of "false" states that the server MUST NOT
perform the <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT> operation if the state of the
destination resource is non-null. By default, the value of
Overwrite is "true," and a client MAY omit this header from a
request when its value is "true." While the Overwrite header
appears to duplicate the functionality of the If-Match: * header
of HTTP/1.1, If-Match applies only to the Request-URI, and not to
the Destination of a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.

<PRE>     Overwrite = "Overwrite" ":" ("true" | "false")
</PRE>

If there is a conflict and the Overwrite header equals "true", or
is absent and thus defaults to "true", then the method MUST fail
with a 409 Conflict.


<h4>3.11.4    Destroy Header</h4>

When deleting a resource the client often wishes to specify
exactly what sort of delete is being enacted. The Destroy header,
used with the Mandatory header, allows the client to specify the
end result they desire. The Destroy header is specified as
follows:

The Undelete token requests that, if possible, the resource
should be left in a state such that it can be undeleted. The
server is not required to honor this request.

<P>The NoUndelete token requests that the resource MUST NOT be left
in a state such that it can be undeleted.

<P>The VersionDestroy token includes the functionality of the
NoUndelete token and extends it to include having the server
remove all versioning references to the resource that it has
control over.

<PRE>     DestroyHeader = "Destroy" ":" #Choices
</PRE>

Choices = "VersionDestroy" | "NoUndelete" | "Undelete" | token
|"&lt;" URI "&gt;" ; a token extension MUST NOT be used unless it is
specified in a RFC16, otherwise a URI MUST be used for
extensions.


<h4>3.11.5    Collection-Member Header</h4>

The Collection-Member header specifies the URI of an external
resource to be added/deleted to/from a collection.

<PRE>     CollectionMember = "Collection-Member" ":" URI
</PRE>


<h3>3.12 Links</h3>


<h4>3.12.1    Source Link Property Type</h4>

Name:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/source
<BR>Purpose:       The destination of the source link identifies the
resource that contains the unprocessed source of the link's
source.
<BR>Schema:        http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/
<BR>Parent:        Any
<BR>Value:         An XML document with zero or more link XML
elements.

Discussion: The source of the link (src) is typically the URI of
the output resource on which the link is defined, and there is
typically only one destination (dst) of the link, which is the
URI where the unprocessed source of the resource may be accessed.
When more than one link destination exists, this specification
asserts no policy on ordering.


<h2>4    State Tokens</h2>

<h3>4.1  Overview</h3>


<h4>4.1.1     Problem Description</h4>

There are times when a principal will want to predicate
successful execution of a method on the current state of a
resource.  While HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism for conditional
execution of methods using entity tags via the "If-Match" and
"If-None-Match" headers, the mechanism is not sufficiently 
extensibleto express conditional statements involving more 
generic state indicators, such as lock tokens.

<P>The fundamental issue with entity tags is that they can only be
generated by a resource. However there are times when a client
will want to be able to share state tokens between resources,
potentially on different servers, as well as be able to generate
certain types of lock tokens without first having to communicate
with a server.

<P>For example, a principal may wish to require that resource B have
a certain state in order for a method to successfully execute on
resource A. If the client submits an e-tag from resource B to
resource A, then A has no way of knowing that the e-tag is meant
to describe resource B.

<P>Another example occurs when a principal wishes to predicate the
successful completion of a method on the absence of any locks on
a resource. It is not sufficient to submit an "If-None-Match: *"
as this refers to the existence of an entity, not of a lock.

<P>This draft defines the term "state token" as an identifier for a
state of a resource. The sections below define requirements for
state tokens and provide a  state token syntax, along with two
new headers which can accept the new state token syntax.


<h4>4.1.2     Solution Requirements</h4>


<H4>4.1.2.1   Syntax</H4>

Self-Describing. A state token must be self describing such that
upon inspecting a state token it is possible to determine what
sort of state token it is, what resource(s) it applies to, and
what state it represents.

<P>This self-describing nature allows servers to accept tokens from
other servers and potentially be able to coordinate state
information cross resource and cross site through standardized
protocols. For example, the execution of a request on resource A
can be predicated on the state of resource B, where A and B are
potentially on different servers.

<P>Client Generable. The state token syntax must allow, when
appropriate, for clients to generate a state token without having
first communicated with a server.

<P>One drawback of entity tags is that they are set by the server,
and there is no interoperable algorithm for calculating an entity
tag. Consequently, a client cannot generate an entity tag from a
particular state of a resource.  However, a state token which
encodes an MD5 state hash could be calculated by a client based
on a client-held state of a resource, and then submitted to a
server in a conditional method invocation.

<P>Another potential use for client generable state tokens is for a
client to generate lock tokens with wild card fields, and hence
be able to express conditionals such as: "only execute this <TT>GET</TT>
if there are no write locks on this resource."


<H4>4.1.2.2   Conditonals</H4>

Universal. A solution must be applicable to all requests.
Positive and Negative. Conditional expressions must allow for the
expression of both positive and negative state requirements.


<h3>4.2  State Token Syntax</h3>
State tokens are URLs employing the following syntax:
<PRE>
State-Token = "StateToken:" Type ":" Resources ":" State-Info
Type = "Type" "=" Caret-encoded-URL
Resources = "Res" "=" Caret-encoded-URL
Caret-encoded-URL = "^" Resource "^"
Resource = &lt;A URI where all "^" characters are escaped&gt;
State-Info = *(uchar | reserved)  ; uchar, reserved defined
section 3.2.1 of RFC 2068
</PRE>

<p>This proposal has created a new URL scheme for state tokens
because a state token names a network resource using its normal
name, which is typically state-invariant, along with additional
information that specifies a particular state of the resource.
Encoding the state information into the native URL scheme of the
network resource was not felt to be safe, since freedom from name
space collisions could not be guaranteed. If this proposal is
accepted, the StateToken URL scheme will need to be defined and
registered with IANA.

<P>State Token URLs begin with the URL scheme name "StateToken"
rather than the name of the particular state token type they
represent in order to make the URL self describing. Thus it is
possible to examine the URL and know, at a minimum, that it is a
state token.

<P>Labeled name/value pairs are used within the token to allow new
fields to be added. Processors of state tokens MUST be prepared
to accept the fields in whatever order they are present and MUST
ignore any fields they do not understand.
The "Type" field specifies the type of the state information
encoded in the state token. A URL is used in order to avoid
namespace collisions.

<P>The "Res" field identifies the resource for which the state token
specifies a particular state. Since commas and spaces are
acceptable URL characters, a caret is used to delimit a URL.
Since a caret is an acceptable URL character, any instances of it
must be escaped using the % escape convention.

<P>The State-Info production is expanded upon in descriptions of
specific state token types, and is intended to contain the state
description information for a particular state token.


<h3>4.3  State Token Conditional Headers</h3>


<h4>4.3.1     If-State-Match</h4>

<PRE>
If-State-Match = "If-State-Match" ":" ("AND" | "OR") 1#("&lt;" State-Token "&gt;")
</PRE>

<p>
The If-State-Match header is intended to have similar
functionality to the If-Match header defined in section 14.25 of
RFC 2068.

<P>If the AND keyword is used and all of the state tokens identify
the state of the resource, then the server MAY perform the
requested method. If the OR keyword is used and any of the state
tokens identifies the current state of the resource, then server
MAY perform the requested method.  If neither of the keyword
requirements is met, the server MUST NOT perform the requested
method, and MUST return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.


<h4>4.3.2     If-None-State-Match</h4>

<PRE>
If-None-State-Match = "If-None-State-Match" ":" 1#("&lt;" State-Token "&gt;")
</PRE>

The If-None-State-Match header is intended to have similar
functionality to the If-None-Match header defined in section
14.26 of RFC 2068.

<P>If any of the state tokens identifies the current state of the
resource, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method.
Instead, if the request method was <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT>, <TT>INDEX</TT>, or <TT>GETMETA</TT>,
the server SHOULD respond with a 304 (Not Modified) response,
including the cache-related entity-header fields (particularly
ETag) of the current state of the resource.  For all other
request methods, the server MUST respond with a status of 412
(Precondition Failed).

<P>If none of the state tokens identifies the current state of the
resource, the server MAY perform the requested method.

<P>Note that the "AND" and "OR" keywords specified with the If-State-Match header are intentionally not defined for If-None-State-Match, because this functionality is not required.


<h3>4.4  State Token Header</h3>

<PRE>
State-Token-Header = "State-Token" ":" 1#("&lt;" State-Token "&gt;")
</PRE>

The State Token header is intended to have similar functionality
to the etag header defined in section 14.20 of RFC 2068. The
purpose of the tag is to return state tokens defined on a
resource in a response. The contents of the state-token are not
guaranteed to be exhaustive and are generally used to return a
new state token that has been defined as the result of a method.
For example, if a <TT>LOCK</TT> method were successfully executed on a
resource the response would include a state token header with the
lock state token included.


<h3>4.5  E-Tags</h3>

E-tags have already been deployed using the If-Match and If-None-Match headers.  Introducing two mechanisms to express e-tags
would only confuse matters, therefore e-tags should continue to
be expressed using quoted strings and the If-Match and If-None-Match headers.

<h2>5    Locking</h2>

<h3>5.1  Locking: Introduction</h3>

Locking is used to arbitrate access to a resource amongst
principals that have equal access rights to that resource.

<P>This specification allows locks to vary over two parameters, the
number of principals involved and the type of access to be
granted. Furthermore, this document only provides the definition
of locking for one access type, write. However, the syntax is
extensible, and allows the specification of other access types.


<h4>5.1.1     Exclusive Vs. Shared Locks</h4>

The most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock. This is a lock
where the access right in question is only granted to a single
principal. The need for this arbitration results from a desire to
avoid having to constantly merge results. In fact, many users so
dislike having to merge that they would rather serialize their
access to a resource rather than have to constantly perform
merges.

<P>However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to
exclude others from exercising an access right but rather to
provide a mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend
to exercise their access right.  Shared locks are provided for
this case. A shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a
lock, hence any principal with appropriate access can get the
lock.

<P>With shared locks there are two trust sets that affect a
resource.  The first trust set is created by access permissions.
Principals who are trusted, for example, may have permission to
write the resource, those who are not, don't.  Among those who
have access permission to write the resource, the set of
principals who have taken out a shared lock also must trust each
other, creating a (typically) smaller trust set within the access
permission write set.

<P>Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most
situations the vast majority of these principals will not have
write access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do
have write access, some principals may decide to guarantee their
edits are free from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write
locks. Others may decide they trust their collaborators (the
potential set of collaborators being the set of principals who
have write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their
collaborators that a principal is potentially working on the
resource.

<P>The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the
communications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their
activities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out
of band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g.,
face-to-face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the
screen, telephone conversation, email, etc.)  The intent of a
shared lock is to let collaborators know who else is potentially
working on a resource.

<P>Shared locks are included because experience from web distributed
authoring systems has indicated that exclusive write locks are
often too rigid.  An exclusive write lock is used to enforce a
particular editing process: take out exclusive write lock, read
the resource, perform edits, write the resource, release the
lock.  What happens if the lock isn't released?  While the time-out mechanism provides one solution, if you need to force the
release of a lock immediately, it doesn't help much.  Granted, an
administrator can release the lock for you, but this could become
a significant burden for large sites. In addition there is the
problem that an administrator may not be immediately available.

<P>Despite their potential problems, exclusive write locks are
extremely useful, since often a guarantee of freedom from
overwrite conflicts is what is needed.  The tradeoff described in
this specification is to provide exclusive write locks, but also
to provide a less strict mechanism in the form of shared locks
which can be used by a set of people who trust each other and who
have access to a communications channel external to HTTP which
can be used to negotiate writing to the resource.


<h4>5.1.2     Required Support</h4>

A WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in
any form. If the server does support locking it may choose to
support any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any
access types.

<P>The reason for this flexibility is that server implementers have
said that they are willing to accept minimum requirements on all
services but locking. Locking policy strikes to the very heart of
their resource management and versioning systems and they require
control over what sort of locking will be made available. For
example, some systems only support shared write locks while
others only provide support for exclusive write locks while yet
others use no locking at all. As each system is sufficiently
different to merit exclusion of certain locking features, the
authors are proposing that locking be allowed as the sole axis of
negotiation within WebDAV.


<h3>5.2  <TT>LOCK</TT> Method</h3>

The following sections describe the <TT>LOCK</TT> method, which is used to
take out a lock of any access type.  These sections on the <TT>LOCK</TT>
method describe only those semantics that are specific to the
<TT>LOCK</TT> method and are independent of the access type of the lock
being requested.  Once the general <TT>LOCK</TT> method has been
described, subsequent sections describe the semantics of the
"write" access type, and the write lock.


<h4>5.2.1     Operation</h4>
A <TT>LOCK</TT> method invocation creates the lock specified by the Lock-Info header on the Request-URI. Lock method requests SHOULD NOT
have a request body. A user-agent SHOULD submit an Owner header
field with a lock request.

<P>A successful response to a lock invocation MUST include Lock-Token and Time-Out headers.


<h4>5.2.2     The Effect of Locks on Properties and Containers</h4>

By default the scope of a lock is the entire state of the
resource, including its body and associated properties. As a
result, a lock on a resource also locks the resource's
properties, and a lock on a property may lock a property's
resource or may restrict the ability to lock the property's
resource. Only a single lock token MUST be used when a lock
extends to cover both a resource and its properties. Note that
certain lock types MAY override this behavior.

<P>For containers, a lock also affects the ability to add or remove
members. The nature of the effect depends upon the type of access
control involved.


<h4>5.2.3     Locking Replicated Resources</h4>

Some servers automatically replicate resources across multiple
URLs. In such a circumstance the server MAY only accept a lock on
one of the URLs if the server can guarantee that the lock will be
honored across all the URLs.


<h4>5.2.4     Locking Multiple Resources</h4>

The <TT>LOCK</TT> method supports locking multiple resources
simultaneously by allowing for the listing of several URIs in the
<TT>LOCK</TT> request. These URIs, in addition to the Request-URI, are
then to be locked as a result of the <TT>LOCK</TT> method's invocation.
When multiple resources are specified the <TT>LOCK</TT> method only
succeeds if all specified resources are successfully locked.

<P>The Lock-Tree option of the lock request specifies that the
resource and all its internal children (including internal
collections, and their internal members) are to be locked. This
is another mechanism by which a request for a lock on multiple
resources can be specified.

<P>Currently existing locks can not be extended to cover more or
less resources, and any request to expand or contract the number
of resources in a lock MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.
So, for example, if resource A is exclusively write locked and
then the same principal asked to exclusively write lock resources
A, B, and C, the request would fail as A is already locked and
the lock can not be extended.

<P>A successful result will return a single lock token which
represents all the resources that have been locked. If an <TT>UNLOCK</TT>
is executed on this token, all associated resources are unlocked.

<P>If the lock can not be granted to all resources, a 406 Conflict
status code MUST be returned with a response entity body
containing a <TT>multiresponse</TT> XML element describing which
resource(s) prevented the lock from being granted.

<h4>5.2.5     Interaction with other Methods</h4>

The interaction of a <TT>LOCK</TT> with various methods is dependent upon
the lock type. However, independent of lock type, a successful
<TT>DELETE</TT> of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed.


<h4>5.2.6     Lock Compatibility Table</h4>

The table below describes the behavior that occurs when a lock
request is made on a resource.

<table>
<tr><th>Lock request<BR>Current lock state<Td>      Shared Lock<td>       Exclusive Lock</tr>
<tr><TD>None<TD>                     True<TD>              True</TR>
<TR><TD>Shared Lock<TD>              True<TD>              False</TR>
<TR><TD>Exclusive Lock<TD>           False<TD>             False*</TR>
</table>

<p>
Legend: True = lock MAY be granted.  False = lock MUST NOT be
granted.  *=if the principal requesting the lock is the owner of
the lock, the lock MAY be regranted.

<P>The current lock state of a resource is given in the leftmost
column, and lock requests are listed in the first row.  The
intersection of a row and column gives the result of a lock
request.  For example, if a shared lock is held on a resource,
and an exclusive lock is requested, the table entry is "false",
indicating the lock must not be granted.

<P>If an exclusive or shared lock is re-requested by the principal
who owns the lock, the lock MUST be regranted. If the lock is
regranted, the same lock token that was previously issued MUST be
returned.


<h4>5.2.7     Status Codes</h4>


<LI> 409 "Conflict" - The resource is locked, so the method has been
rejected.


<LI> 412 "Precondition Failed" - The included state-token was not
enforceable on this resource or the request in the lock-info
header could not be satisfied by the server.


<h4>5.2.8     Lock-Info Request Header</h4>

The Lock-Info request header specifies the scope and type of a
lock for a <TT>LOCK</TT> method request. The syntax specification below is
extensible, allowing new type and scope identifiers to be added.

<PRE>
LockInfo = "Lock-Info" ":" DAVLockType SP DAVLockScope [SP
AdditionalLocks] [SP Lock-Tree]
DAVLockType = "LockType" "=" DAVLockTypeValue
DAVLockTypeValue = ("Write" | *(uchar | reserved))
DAVLockScope = "LockScope" "=" DAVLockScopeValue
DAVLockScopeValue = ("Exclusive" |"Shared" | *(uchar | reserved))
AdditionalLocks = "AddLocks" "=" 1*("&lt;" URI "&gt;")
Lock-Tree = "Lock-Tree" "=" ("True" | "False")
</PRE>

The LockType field specifies the access type of the lock.  At
present, this specification only defines one lock type, the
"Write" lock.  The LockScope field specifies whether the lock is
an exclusive lock, or a shared lock.  The AddLocks field
specifies additional URIs, beyond the Request-URI, to which the
lock request applies.  The LockTree field is used to specify
recursive locks.  If the LockTree field is "true", the lock
request applies to the hierarchy traversal of the internal
members resources of the Request-URI, and the AddLocks URIs,
inclusive of the Request-URI and the AddLocks URIs. It is not an
error if LockTree is true, and the Request-URI or the AddLocks
URIs have no internal member resources. By default, the value of
LockTree is "false", and this field MAY be omitted when its value
is false.


<h4>5.2.9     Owner Request Header</h4>


<H4>5.2.9.1   Problem Description</H4>

When discovering the list of owners of locks on a resource, a
principal may want to be able to contact the owner directly. For
this to be possible the lock discovery mechanism must provide
enough information for the lock owner to be contacted.
Additionally, programs may wish to be able to record structured
information in the owner header so that other programs may be
able to parse it later. Note, however, that these programs may
not necessarily be coordinating so there need be no guarantee
that the information can be parsed.


<H4>5.2.9.2   Solution Requirements</H4>

Not all systems have authentication procedures that provide
sufficient information to identify a particular user in a way
that is meaningful to a person. In addition, many systems that do
have sufficient information, such as a name and e-mail address,
do not have the ability to associate this information with the
lock discovery mechanism. Therefore a means is needed to allow
principals to provide authentication in a manner which will be
meaningful to a person.

<P>The From header (defined in RFC 2068), which contains only an
email mailbox, is not sufficient for the purposes of quick
identification. When desperately looking for someone to remove a
lock, e-mail is often not sufficient. A telephone number (cell
number, pager number, etc.) would be better. Furthermore, the
email address in the From header only optionally includes the
owners name and that name is often set to an alias anyway.
Therefore a header more flexible than From is required.

<P>The value also needs to be such that both man and machine can
place values in it and later retrieve those values.


<H4>5.2.9.3   Syntax</H4>

<PRE>
Owner = "Owner" ":" (Coded-XML  | quoted-string)
Coded-XML = field-content    ; XML where any character which is
  not legal in field-content (see section 4.2 of [Fielding et al.,
  1997]) is XML encoded
</PRE>

The XML SHOULD provide information sufficient for either directly
contacting the principal (such as a telephone number or e-mail
URI), or for discovering the principal (such as the URL of a
homepage) who owns the lock. The quoted string SHOULD provide a
means for directly contacting the principal who owns the lock,
such as a name and telephone number.

<h4>5.2.10    Time-Out Header</h4>

<H4>5.2.10.1  Problem Description</H4>

In a perfect world principals take out locks, work on the
resource, and then remove the lock when it is no longer needed.
However, this process is frequently not completed, leaving active
but unused locks. Reasons for this include client programs
crashing and losing information about locks, users leaving their
systems for the day and forgetting to remove their locks, etc. As
a result of this behavior, servers need to establish a policy by
which they can remove a lock without input from the lock owner.
Once such a policy is instituted, the server also needs a
mechanism to inform the principal of the policy.

<H4>5.2.10.2  Solution Requirements</H4>

There are two basic lock removal policies: administrator and time
based removal. In the case of administrator based removal, a
principal other than the lock owner has sufficient access rights
to order the lock removed, even though they did not take it out.
The second policy type is time based removal.  In this case, a
timer is set as soon as the lock is created. Every time a method
is executed on any resource covered by the lock, the timer is
reset. If the timer runs out, the lock is removed.

<P>User-agents MUST assume that locks may arbitrarily disappear at
any time. If their actions require confirmation of the existence
of a lock then the If-State headers are available.


<H4>5.2.10.3  Syntax</H4>

<PRE>
TimeOut = "Time-Out" ":" 1#TimeType
TimeType = ("Second-" DAVTimeOutVal | "Infinite" | Extend)
DAVTimeOutVal = 1*digit
Extend = RFC-Reg | URL "-" Token ; The URL format is used for
unregistered TimeTypes
RFC-Req = Token ; This is a TimeType that has been published as an RFC
</PRE>


Clients MAY include TimeOut headers in their <TT>LOCK</TT> requests.
However the server is not required to honor or even consider the
request. Clients MUST NOT submit a Time-Out request header with
any method other than a <TT>LOCK</TT> method.

<P>A Time-Out request header MUST contain at least one TimeType and
MAY contain multiple TimeType entries. The purpose of listing
multiple TimeType is to indicate multiple different values and
value types that are acceptable to the client. The client lists
the TimeType entries in order of preference.

<P>The Time-Out response header MUST use a Second value, Infinite,
or a TimeType the client has indicated familiarity with. The
server MAY assume a client is familiar with any TimeType
submitted in a Time-Out header.

<P>The "Second" TimeType specifies the number of seconds that MUST
elapse between granting of the lock at the server, and the
automatic removal of the lock. A server MUST not generate a time
out value for "Second" greater than 2^32-1.

<P>The time out counter is restarted any time the client sends a
method to any member of the lock, including unsupported methods,
or methods which are unsuccessful. It is recommended that the
<TT>HEAD</TT> method be used when the goal is simply to restart the time
out counter.

<P>If the timeout expires then the lock is lost. Specifically the
server SHOULD act as if an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method was executed by the
server on the resource using the lock token of the timed-out
lock, performed with its override authority. Thus logs,
notifications, and other mechanisms that act as side effects to
the granting and removal of a lock will be properly informed as
to the disposition of the lock.

<P>Servers are advised to pay close attention to the values
submitted by clients, as they will be indicative of the type of
activity the client intends to perform. For example, an applet
running in a browser may need to lock a resource, but because of
the instability of the environment within which the applet is
running, the applet may be turned off without warning. As a
result, the applet is likely to ask for a relatively small time-out value so that if the applet dies, the lock can be quickly
harvested. However a document management system is likely to ask
for an extremely long time-out because its user may be planning
on going off-line.


<h4>5.2.11    Lock Response</h4>

A successful lock response MUST contain a Lock-Token response
header, a Time-Out header and a <TT>Prop</TT> element in the response body
which contains the value of the LockDiscovery property.


<H4>5.2.11.1  Lock-Token Response Header</H4>

If a resource is successfully locked then a lock-token header
will be returned containing the lock token that represents the
lock.

<PRE>
Lock-Token = "Lock-Token" ":" URI
</PRE>

This example shows a request for an exclusive write lock on three
resources,
http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc,
http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/, and http://foo.bar/blah.  In
this request, the client has specified that it desires an
infinite length lock, if available, otherwise a timeout of 4.1
billion seconds, if available.  The Owner header field specifies
the web address for contact information for the principal taking
out the lock.

<P>This lock request has failed, because the server rejected the
lock request for http://foo.bar/blah.  The 409 Conflict status
code indicates that the server was unable to satisfy the request
because there is a conflict between the state of the resources
and the operation named in the request.  Within the
<TT>multiresponse</TT>, the 202 Accepted status code indicates that the
lock method was accepted by the resources, and would have been
completed if all resources named in the request were able to be
locked.  The 403 Forbidden status code indicates that the server
does not allow lock requests on this resource.

<h3>5.3  Write Lock</h3>

This section describes the semantics specific to the write access
type for locks.  The write lock is a specific instance of a lock
type, and is the only lock type described in this specification.


<h4>5.3.1     Methods Restricted by Write Locks</h4>

A write lock prevents a principal without the lock from
successfully executing a <TT>PUT</TT>, <TT>POST</TT>, <TT>PATCH</TT>, <TT>PROPPATCH</TT>, <TT>MOVE</TT>,
<TT>DELETE</TT>, <TT>MKCOL</TT>, <TT>ADDREF</TT> or <TT>DELREF</TT> on the locked resource. All other
current methods, <TT>GET</TT> in particular, function independent of the
lock.

<P>Note, however, that as new methods are created it will be
necessary to specify how they interact with a write lock.


<h4>5.3.2     Write Locks and Properties</h4>

While those without a write lock may not alter a property on a
resource it is still possible for the values of live properties
to change, even while locked, due to the requirements of their
schemas. Only dead properties and live properties defined to
respect locks are guaranteed to not change while write locked.

<P>If a property is write locked then a <TT>LOCK</TT> request on the
associated resource MUST fail with a 409 "Conflict". Note that a
write lock on a property MAY be extended to include the
associated resource without the principal having explicitly
requested the extension.


<h4>5.3.3     Write Locks and Null Resources</h4>

It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order
to lock the name. Please note, however, that locking a null
resource effectively makes the resource non-null as the resource
now has lock related properties defined on it.


<h4>5.3.4     Write Locks and Collections</h4>
A write lock on a collection prevents the addition or removal of
members of the collection. As a consequence, when a principal
issues a request to create a new internal member of a collection
using <TT>PUT</TT> or <TT>POST</TT>, or to remove an existing internal member of a
collection using <TT>DELETE</TT>, this request MUST fail if the principal
does not have a write lock on the collection.

<P>However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection
containing internal member resources that are currently locked,
the request MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.


<h4>5.3.5     Write Locks and <TT>COPY/MOVE</TT></h4>

The owner of a write lock MUST NOT execute a <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a
resource they have locked. This specification intentionally does
not define what happens if a <TT>MOVE</TT> method request is made on a
locked resource by the lock's owner.

<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> method invocation MUST NOT duplicate any write locks
active on the source.


<h4>5.3.6     Re-issuing Write Locks</h4>

If a principal already owns a write lock on a resource, any
future requests for the same type of write lock, on the same
resource, while the principal's previous write lock is in effect,
MUST result in a successful response with the same lock token as
provided for the currently existing lock. Two lock requests are
defined to be identical if their Lock-Info headers are identical.


<h4>5.3.7     Write Locks and The State-Token Header</h4>


<H4>5.3.7.1   Problem Definition</H4>

If a user agent is not required to have knowledge about a lock
when requesting an operation on a locked resource, the following
scenario might occur. Program A, run by User A, takes out a write
lock on a resource. Program B, also run by User A, has no
knowledge of the lock taken out by Program A, yet performs a <TT>PUT</TT>
to the locked resource. In this scenario, the <TT>PUT</TT> succeeds
because locks are associated with a principal, not a program, and
thus program B, because it is acting with principal A's
credential, is allowed to perform the <TT>PUT</TT>. However, had program B
known about the lock, it would not have overwritten the resource,
preferring instead to present a dialog box describing the
conflict to the user. Due to this scenario, a mechanism is needed
to prevent different programs from accidentally ignoring locks
taken out by other programs with the same authorization.


<H4>5.3.7.2   Solution Requirement</H4>

The solution must not require principals to perform discovery in
order to prevent accidental overwrites as this could cause race
conditions.

<P>The solution must not require that clients guess what sorts of
locks might be used and use if-state-match headers with wildcards
to prevent collisions. The problem with trying to "guess" which
locks are being used is that new lock types might be introduced,
and the program would not know to "guess them". So, for example,
a client might put in an if-state-match header with a wildcard
specifying that if any write lock is outstanding then the
operation should fail. However a new read/write lock could be
introduced which the client would not know to put in the header.


<H4>5.3.7.3   State-Token Header</H4>

The State-Token header, containing a lock token owned by the
requesting principal, is used by the principal to indicate that
the principal is aware of the existence of the lock specified by
the lock token. It is used in the following way.

<P>If the following conditions are met:
     1.   a user-agent has authenticated itself as a principal,
     2.   the user-agent is submitting a method request to a
resource
          on which the principal owns a write lock,
     3.   the method is restricted by a write lock, as defined in
the
          section "Methods Restricted by a Write Lock",
then the method request MUST include a State-Token header with
the  lock token of the write lock, or the method fails with a 409
Conflict status code. If multiple resources are involved with a
method, such as a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT> method, then the lock tokens, if
any, for all involved resources, MUST be included in the State-Token request header.

<P>For example, Program A, used by user A, takes out a write lock on
a resource. Program A then makes a number of <TT>PUT</TT> requests on the
locked resource, all the requests contain a State-Token header
which includes the write lock state token. Program B, also run by
User A, then proceeds to perform a <TT>PUT</TT> to the locked resource.
However program B was not aware of the existence of the lock and
so does not include the appropriate state-token header. The
method is rejected even though principal A is authorized to
perform the <TT>PUT</TT>. Program B can, if it so chooses, now perform
lock discovery and obtain the lock token. Note that program A and
B can perform GETs without using the state-token header because
the ability to perform a <TT>GET</TT> is not affected by a write lock.

<P>Having a lock state token provides no special access rights.
Anyone can find out anyone else's lock state token by performing
lock discovery. Locks are to be enforced based upon whatever
authentication mechanism is used by the server, not based on the
secrecy of the token values.


<H4>5.3.7.3.1 Example</H4>

<PRE>COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html
State-Token: &lt;OpaqueLockToken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2&gt;
&lt;OpaqueLockToken:AAAASDFcalkjfdas12312&gt;

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>

In this example, both the source and destination are locked so
two lock tokens must be submitted. If only one of the two
resources was locked, then only one token would have to be
submitted.

<h3>5.4  Lock Tokens</h3>

<h4>5.4.1     Problem Description</h4>

It is possible that once a lock has been granted it may be
removed without the lock owner's knowledge. This can cause
serialization problems if the lock owner executes methods
thinking their lock is still active. Due to this, a mechanism is
needed for a principal to predicate the successful execution of a
message upon the continuing existence of a lock.


<h4>5.4.2     Lock Token Introduction</h4>

A lock token is a type of state token that describes a particular
lock.  A lock token is returned by every successful <TT>LOCK</TT>
operation, and can also be discovered through lock discovery on a
resource.

<P>There are two types of lock tokens, a generic lock token, which
is unique only for a particular resource, and an opaque lock
token, which is unique across all resources for all time.

<P>Uniqueness for a particular resource prevents problems with long
held outstanding lock tokens being confused with newer tokens.
This uniqueness requirement is the same as for e-tags. Uniqueness
across all resources for all time allows for tokens to be
submitted across resources and servers without fear of confusion.

<P>Generic lock tokens, because of their relaxed uniqueness
requirements, are faster to generate than opaque lock tokens.


<h4>5.4.3     Generic Lock Tokens</h4>

Any valid URI can be used by the resource as a generic lock
token. The only requirement is that the lock token MUST never
have been issued previously on that resource. Because a lock
token is only guaranteed to be unique on the resource that
generated it, the lock token MUST NOT be submitted in a state-token request header or an if-state[-not]-match header on any
resource but the resource that generated it.


<h4>5.4.4     OpaqueLockToken Lock Token</h4>

The opaquelocktoken scheme is designed to be unique across all
resources for all time. Due to this uniqueness quality, a client
MAY submit an opaque lock token in a state-token request header
and an if-state[-not]-match header on a resource other than the
one that returned it.

<P>All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and be
able to, at minimum, recognize that the lock token was not
generated by the resource. Note, however, that resources are not
required to generate opaquelocktokens.

<P>In order to guarantee uniqueness across all resources for all
time the opaquelocktoken requires the use of the GUID mechanism.

<P>Opaquelocktoken generators however have a choice of how they
create these tokens. They can either generate a new GUID for
every lock token they create, which is potentially very
expensive, or they can create a single GUID and then add
extension characters. If the second method is selected then the
program generating the extensions MUST guarantee that the same
extension will never be used twice with the associated GUID.

<PRE>
Opaque-Lock-Token = "OpaqueLockToken" ":" GUID [Extension]
GUID = ; As defined in [LEACH]
Extension = *urlc   ;urlc is defined in [Berners-Lee et al.,
1997] (draft-fielding-url-syntax-07.txt)
</PRE>

<h3>5.5  <TT>UNLOCK</TT> Method</h3>

<h4>5.5.1     Problem Definition</h4>

The <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method removes the lock identified by the lock token
in the State-Token header from the Request-URI, and all other
resources included in the lock.


<h4>5.5.2     Example</h4>

<PRE><TT>UNLOCK</TT> /workspace/webdav/info.doc HTTP/1.1
Host: webdav.sb.aol.com
State-Token: OpaqueLockToken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>

In this example, the lock identified by the lock token
"OpaqueLockToken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2" is successfully removed from
the resource http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/info.doc.
If this lock included more than just one resource, the lock is
removed from those resources as well.


<h3>5.6  Discovery Mechanisms</h3>

<h4>5.6.1     Lock Capability Discovery</h4>

<H4>5.6.1.1   Problem Definition</H4>

Since server lock support is optional, a client trying to lock a
resource on a server can either try the lock and hope for the
best, or perform some form of discovery to determine what lock
capabilities the server supports.  This is known as lock
capability discovery. Lock capability discovery differs from
discovery of supported access control types, since there may be
access control types without corresponding lock types.

<H4>5.6.1.2   SupportedLock Property</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lock/supportedlock
<BR>Purpose: To provide a listing of the lock capabilities supported
by the resource.
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Values: An XML document containing zero or more LockEntry XML
elements.
<BR>Description: The SupportedLock property of a resource returns a
listing of the combinations of scope and access types which may
be specified in a lock request on the resource. Note that the
actual contents are themselves controlled by access controls so a
server is not required to provide information the client is not
authorized to see. If SupportedLock is available on "*" then it
MUST define the set of locks allowed on all resources on that
server.

<H4>5.6.1.3   LOCKENTRY XML Element</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lockentry
<BR>Purpose: Defines a DAVLockType/LockScope pair which may be
legally used with a <TT>LOCK</TT> on the specified resource.
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: A SupportedLock entry
<BR>Values: LockType LockScope

<H4>5.6.1.4   LOCKTYPE XML Element</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/locktype
<BR>Purpose: Lists a DAVLockType
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: LOCKENTRY
<BR>Values: DAVLockTypeValue

<H4>5.6.1.5   LOCKSCOPE XML Element</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lockscope
<BR>Purpose: Lists a DAVLockScope
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: LOCKENTRY
<BR>Values: DAVLockScopeValue

<h4>5.6.2     Active Lock Discovery</h4>

<H4>5.6.2.1   Problem Definition</H4>

If another principal locks a resource that a principal wishes to
access, it is useful for the second principal to be able to find
out who the first principal is.

<H4>5.6.2.2   Solution Requirements</H4>

The lock discovery mechanism should provide a list of who has the
resource locked, what locks they have, and what their lock tokens
are. The lock tokens are useful in shared lock situations where
two principals may want to guarantee that they do not overwrite
each other. The lock tokens are also useful for administrative
purposes so that an administrator can remove a lock by referring
to its token.

<H4>5.6.2.3   LOCKDISCOVERY Property</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lockdiscovery
<BR>Purpose: To discover what locks are active on a resource
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Values= An XML document containing zero or more ActiveLock XML
elements.

<P>Description: The LOCKDISCOVERY property returns a listing of who
has a lock, what type of lock they have, the time out type and
the time remaining on the time out, and the associated lock
token. The server is free to withhold any or all of this
information if the requesting principal does not have sufficient
access rights to see the requested data. A server which supports
locks MUST provide the LOCKDISCOVERY property on any resource
with locks on it.

<H4>5.6.2.4   ACTIVELOCK XML Element</H4>

Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/activelock
<BR>Purpose: A multivalued XML element that describes a particular
active lock on a resource
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: A LOCKDISCOVERY entry
<BR>Values= LOCKTYPE LOCKSCOPE [ADDLOCKS] OWNER TIMEOUT LOCKTOKEN

<H4>5.6.2.5   OWNER XML Element</H4>

<BR>Purpose: Returns owner information
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: ACTIVELOCK
<BR>Values= XML:REF | {any valid XML string}
<H4>5.6.2.6   TIMEOUT XML Element</H4>

<BR>Purpose: Returns information about the timeout associated with
the lock
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
<BR>Parent: ACTIVELOCK
<BR>Values= TimeType

<H4>5.6.2.7   ADDLOCKS XML Element</H4>

<BR>Purpose: Lists additional resources associated with this lock, if
any.
<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/
