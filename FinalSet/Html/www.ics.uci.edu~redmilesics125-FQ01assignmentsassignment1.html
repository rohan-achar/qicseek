<H3>Due as a Class Presentation beginning Monday, October

<H4>Assignment Requirements</H4>

<P>This assignment consists of a class presentation by one or more of
the team members. Some overhead transparencies will be provided to
each team or teams can bring a disk with PowerPoint Slides for
projection from the instructor's laptop.  Transparencies may be hand
written if neatly done. Transparencies should be turned in after the
presentation. Grading is both on the content and the quality of the presentation.</P>

<H4>Purpose and Content</H4>

<P>The purpose of this exercise is to convince your client that you
can effectively complete the project they have
described. Effectiveness means that you can elicit further
requirements from them and reach a mutual agreement.  The project bid
should convince the hearers (primarily me) that your team has a good
understanding of the problem, are anticipating questions to elicit
further requirements from the client, have a rough idea of the process
or lifecycle you will follow (remember process and lifecycle diagrams
from ICS 121), have an idea of how you will test the project (perhaps
an &quot;acceptance test&quot; or initial ideas about it), have an
idea of the kinds of technology you will employ, and, finally, that
your team members provide a sufficient mix of skills and
experience.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Projects often begin vaguely. Clients do not have complete ideas about
the work that should be done. They may not fully anticipate their needs.
Therefore your project bid will not be exact. You will have to guess about
some aspects of the project. You will have to struggle with ambiguities
and uncertainties. The point however is to demonstrate that you have tried
to understand the problem as best as possible and have begun to think about
the entire project lifecycle.</P>

<P>You should already have contacted the potential client. I will ask about
this at the presentation.  Remember, it is best to select one person from the
team to coordinate with the (potential) client.</P>

<P>You might think back to ICS 121 Assignment 3 (depdending on your
instructor) Lifecycle Considerations and Validation. </P>
