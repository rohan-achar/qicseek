ABSTRACT:
<P>Recently, Luo, et al. in a series of papers [LL00, KZLLZ01, KLXL02, LZKLZ02, 
	LKZLZ04] proposed a system called&nbsp;<A href="http://www-faculty.cs.uiuc.edu/~haiyun/research/research.html#ProjURSA">URSA</A>
	for providing ubiquitous and robust access control in mobile ad hoc networks 
	without relying on a centralized authority. The URSA system relies on the new 
	proactive RSA signature scheme, which allows members in an ad hoc group to make 
	access control decisions in a distributed manner. The proposed proactive RSA 
	signature scheme is assumed secure as long as no more than an allowed threshold 
	of participating members is simultaneously corrupted at any point in the 
	lifetime of the scheme.
</P>
<P>In this paper we show an attack on this proposed proactive RSA scheme, in which 
	an admissible threshold of malicious group members can completely recover the 
	group RSA secret key in the course of the lifetime of this scheme. Our attack 
	stems from the fact that the threshold signature protocol which is a part of 
	this proactive RSA scheme leaks some seemingly innocuous information about the 
	secret signature key. We show how the corrupted members can influence the 
	execution of the scheme in such a way so that the slowly leaked information is 
	used to reconstruct the entire shared secret.
