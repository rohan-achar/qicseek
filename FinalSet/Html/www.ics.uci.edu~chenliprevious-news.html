about the computer cluster workforce in Orange County.  There is
an excellent <a href="docs/oc-workworce-computer-survey2007.pdf">survey</a>
on the needs of computer cluster workforce in the county.  One interesting
finding is that the county is facing the challenge of not being able
to find enough workers in the IT industry.  The survey also gives
us some thoughts on how we design our education curriculum to meet the
need of the industry.

  structures that can significantly improve the performance of
  approximate string search.

<li> (10/2007) <b>New NSF Grant</b>: We received an NSF grant of $95K
for our proposal titled "SGER: Answering Approximate String Queries

will have two visitors (Xiaochun Yang and Bin Wang).
I will visit a few places (IBM, SRI,
Yahoo, Google, possibly Toronto, and VLDB in Korea).  Well, these will
keep me busy enough, not to mention I have two sons to play with :-)


<li>(5/2006) <b>New PhD Student</b>: I am glad that a new student, Yiming Lu,
is joining our PhD program soon.  He graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong
University with a BS and an MS, and has been working on data quality
at <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/asia/default.aspx">Microsoft
Research Asia</a>.

<li> (5/2006) <b>Work on Query Relaxation</b>: Our paper titled <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chenli/pub/vldb06.pdf">Relaxing Join and
Selection Queries</a> (joint work with Nick Koudas, Anthony Tung, and
my student, Rares Vernica) will appear in VLDB 2006, Seoul, Korea.  It
is about how to relax empty-answer SQL queries in RDBMS in order to
compute answers for users with a minimal relaxation.  We use skyline
as our relaxation framework, in which we need to consider join
conditions as well.  The work extends our previous work on supporting
approximate query answering in applications such as data cleaning.
See our two VLDB'2005 papers on similar topics.

<li> (5/2006) <b>CleanDB Workshop</b>: I am currently organizing the
<a href="http://pike.psu.edu/cleandb06/">CleanDB Workshop</a> with <a
href="http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/pro/">Dongwon Lee</a>. It will be
colocated with <a
href="http://aitrc.kaist.ac.kr/%7Evldb06/">VLDB2006</a> in Seoul,
Korea.

<li> (5/2006) <b>New Release of StringMap</b>: I spent some days
cleaning the StringMap code that supports approximate string searches
and joins. The new release is available at <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~flamingo/release/index.html">here</a>.

<li> (4/2006) <b>$$ from M$R</b>: In April 2006, I received an unrestricted
gift fund from Microsoft Research.  I want to thank them for their
generous support.  It's very encouraging, and I wish to receive more
support from the industry in the future.
