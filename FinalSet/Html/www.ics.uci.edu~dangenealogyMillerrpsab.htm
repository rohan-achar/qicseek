I came across the Jewish geneological organization website and began scanning
for names and towns of my parents'  family in Poland.
My mother's maiden name is Muller; she was born in Switzerland, but her parents
came from Poland, her father from Tarnow.  His name was Salomon Muller.  His
father's name was Joseph Muller and his mother was Sara (Leisten) Muller.
Are you looking for Mullers or Millers?  Am curious to hear...
Shalom.

Moishe,

I forgot to mention that my grandfather, Salomon Muller, had 3 siblings:  Adolf
(Abraham) who married Cyrel Schapiro; David,  who married Erna Plattner, and a
sister Blima, who married Kalman Citrinbaum.  (it is their daughter, Shulamith,
who is trying to trace the family history.)

Their father, Joseph, married Sarah Leisten (from Tarnow).  Joseph was from
Lezajsk.

The story unfolds...

Hello again from Toronto, Canada.

I received your response to my e mail, looked up your 
website (VERY INTERESTING!!! and no doubt a lot of effort
and time went into the research), and was convinced that
there are no links between us.

HOWEVER, today I was visiting my folks and started to 
question my mother on some of the names in her family.
She gave me some info from her mother's side (Muhlrad) 
and some from her father's side that a cousin in Israel
(also researching the family tree) supplied her with. 
And if my info is of use to you, perhaps I can get you
in touch with that cousin for more information. (her
name is Shulamith Bet-Yannai, formerly Winestock, 
nee Citrinbaum)

Well, I was reviewing the info and then plugged back 
onto your website, to the broken Miller branches, 
specifically Muellers from Strzyzow and Lezajsk, and I
found some common information. I quote now from letter 
written to my mother in 1992 from that cousin in Israel.

&quot;As you probably know, our grandfather wrote about his 
father, Shabtai, and mentioned his own grandfather and 
grandmother, namely isaac and Chaya-Tzvia.  He also 
wrote that Shabtai was born and died in Strzyzow, and 
not in Lejansk as we thought.  I looked for this place 
at the library and at my great astonishment found a huge
Yizkor book from that shtetl, about 400 pages, half 
Hebrew, half Yiddish.  Unfortunately there is nothing 
left from that community since a fire burst out in 1898
and all the documents were destroyed.  From what our
grandfather wrote, it appears that when he did write 
those pages, his mother, Fruma, born Licht ,was still 
alive.&quot;

There is also another letter from the cousin mentioning
some different names--
Hauser ; Miriam-Gitche Singer , nee Hauser, and my 
grandfather were first cousins.  And there were names of
cousins Feiga, Dora, Kalman and Shmuel who perished in 
the Holocaust.

So, I've suddenly become VERY fascinated by the family 
connections, and hope I can help somehow in your 
research.  My mother will supply me with more info if 
necessary, as will her sister in Chicago.

Looking forward to hearing from you...

Pearl Saban

     Hi,
     I have communicated with Shulamith several times. 
     How are you related to her? That family is definitely
     related to mine. If you are from, we are somehow 
     cousins. I have contacted some members from Canada
     that spell the name as Mueller. They were studying 
     in Switzerland in the 1930's I believe. Are you from
     this branch? Can you expand out the upper portion of
     the tree any further?
     -Moishe

Shulamith is my mother's first cousin; Shulamith's mother,
Blima, was my mother's father's sister.  Shulamith also 
has a sister, Tirza, in Israel. The Citrinbaums used to 
live in Geneva, Switzerland. The Muellers are my mother's
first cousins; their father, Adolf (Abraham) was my 
grandfather's brother.  They were all born in Switzerland,
living in Zurich; my mother was born in Basel.  They 
&quot;made aliyah&quot; to Canada in the early fifties, I believe,
and my mother came to visit them in 1956; she met my 
father on that visit and the rest is Adler-Muller history.

The Muellers also vary the spelling of their name; some
are Muller; some are Mueller; some are Miller.
There are several siblings: Marcus (who passed away from
polio as a young boy); Ignaz (Irving, who lives here; he's
a Mueller); Sylvain (named after Shabsi; he's a Miller 
and lives here); Gabi (Gabriel, who lives in Ohio, I 
think and is a Miller); Michael (who lives here and is a
Muller); Raphael (Ralph, who lives here and is a Muller);
and there's a sister, Helen Krokocki, who lived in Toronto,
but has made aliyah and lives on a moshav with her family.

Does that help any?
Pearl

Hi,
So we are definately cousins, just do not know how. You 
have a very elderly cousin out in CA who supplied me 
with info as well. Any chance of you getting the death
record for Yitzchok from Stryzow?
Take Care and please stay in touch. If you know of any 
other cousins, please tell me, even if you do not know 
how they are related. I spoke to Ignacz because he went 
to school with Johnny Miller, who is on our tree.

Yes, that elderly cousin in California is no doubt 
Gershon Muller; I think because of Shulamith's research,
my mother reconnected with him several years ago, and 
they talk on the phone at least once a year.  He's over 
80; at least I think that was the last significant b'dayhe had.  Maybe he's
older.
I doubt I can get a death record for Yitchok, but I'll 
see what's out there. I think my grandfather, Salomon, 
had written family tree matters, ie. births, deaths, 
marriages in his Yom Tov machzors; I can  check that out
too.  I'll keep you supplied with info. if there's any 
to be had.
Many years ago (14 to be exact) I was in Israel and 
visiting elderly cousins of my mother, no doubt a cousin
of my mother's father. I remember talking about family 
connections and she said that it's said that the 
author/playwright Arthur Miller is from the family 
(Family resemblances are strong), that his father or was
it his grandfather, had left Poland decades earlier for
the U.S.  Family members have tried to reach him on that
matter, but I think he denies it.  Have you heard of this
potential family member?
Have a good Shabbos.

Dear Moishe,
     
No doubt you've heard of the saying &quot;Oh, what a tangled web we weave...&quot;
     
Well, I just thought I'd let you know in  a warped way how very true that is.
     
I'd been in touch with you last fall, as you discovered my name on the Jewish 
Gen. site and my search for Miller; you wrote about your family tree and I wrote
to you how I'm connected to it.
     
My connection is via the Broken Miller Branches file, specifically the Muellers 
from Strzyzow, and Lesanjsk, Galicia.  My mother's  paternal grandfather, Joseph
Muller, was the son of Shabsi Muller who married Frimit Licht (I think that's 
how it goes...)  My mother is from Basel, Switzerland, her parents went there 
after Poland, etc. (my mom's first cousin is Shulamith Bet-Yannai in 
Jerusalem...) Ring any bells...?
     
Well, for months, I've been looking back at your site, looking for updates, etc.
 One day, I was reading the dedication names and cross-references, and ended up
in the Shabsi (Bukovska) Yitzchak Miller Family tree, and was scanning names of 
parents and children, specifically  Avrohm.  I came upon the name of one of his 
daughter, Tzvetta.  Now, it jumped off the screen for me because I've only heard
that name once before -- my cousin had a baby earlier this year and gave that 
middle name to her after her late grandmother whom she was quite close to.  I 
read on in the description and saw the names of Tzvetta's kids, one of whom is 
Chana Geller.  Well,  this cousin I mentioned is my first cousin's wife; her 
maiden name was Geller.  She was out of town for the summer, so I couldn't reach
her to ask her if that's her mother's name.  We found an invitation for that 
cousin's wedding  about 21 years ago, and saw that her mother's name is Chana 
Geller.  Could it be the same one? I wondered for about 3 months.
     
Well, tonight after Shabbat was over, I finally got to reach this cousin (Far 
Rockaway, NY) by phone, threw out my left field question to her if her 
grandmother passed away at the listed year, and went on to read the description.
 Lo and behold, yes! Chana Geller is this cousin's mother, Tzvetta was her
grandmother and a Miller by birth.
     
I don't know if you still consider that the Broken Miller Branches  (from which 
I stem) are part of the big picture, and related, but isn't that weird?  My 
mother was the Muller; she married my dad, an Adler.  That Adler has one sister 
who has one son. That son married a Geller; that Geller's grandmother had been a
Miller at birth and on your tree.
     
I will be sending my cousin the information and the web site address for the 
tree; she'll be delighted and interested to see it and the photo of Tzvetta that
you placed with the description. My cousin, Sara, tells me her mother, Chana, 
was born in the U.S., not Europe.
     
I have heard from others who saw my name on the Jewish Gen. site, and the names 
and places I was curious about.  And yes, I did find other relatives.  Oh, how 
the world is made a smaller place...
     
Wishing you and yours all the best for the coming year.  May it be filled with 
lots of good health, happiness, and continued information for your family tree. 
Keep up the good work!
     
Best,
     
     
Pearl Saban

Hi, Moishe,
     
Here is a brief explanation again--my only first cousin from my FATHER's 
side (my father's only surviving sibling's only child) married a girl, Sara 
Geller.  Sara Geller's mother is Chana Geller; Chana is the youngest 
daughter of Tzvetta, who was born a Miller and married R. Dovid Nusson 
Lesser.  Sara had a baby earlier this year, whom she named Adina Tzvetta.
     
As for Joseph Muller... I don't know that he fits into the big tree; he'd be 
an offshoot from that broken Lezansk branch.  My mother is Lilli 
Muller-Adler; her father was Salomon Muller of Tarnow, later of Basel, 
Switzerland.  Salomon's parents were Joseph and Sara(Leisten) ; Joseph's 
father was Shabtai, who married Frimit Licht; Shabtai's parents were Yitchok 
and Chaya Tzvia.
     
I think my grandfather, Salomon, had written some brief Yahrzeits and 
names/details in the inside cover of his siddurim and machzorim, but it's in 
German, and what my mother could make out of the information just names the 
children of Shabsi (Shabtai) and Frimit and brief outlines of who they married 
and number of kids.
     
Moishe, I'm such an amateur at this genealogy stuff, I don't even know what 
those 2 references you mentioned are.  All I've done is ask my mother in the 
past year for names; it's her first cousin in Israel, Shulamith, who's 
avidly pursuing this tree for years. I really have no other details, I'm 
sorry.  If my mother finds any other of my grandfather's papers with family 
information, I'll be sure to pass it on.  My mother has an older sister 
living in Chicago (Dr. Esther Kornel), but I don't know if she has any of my 
grandfather's personal papers; I doubt it, because after my grandmother 
died, and my grandfather moved from Switzerland to Canada, he lived with us, 
until his death in 1965. (I'd just turned 4 at the time)
     
If you've already been in touch with my mother's first cousins here in 
Toronto, as you mentioned in a former e-mail, (ie. Ignacz-Irving, I think it 
was), they must've given you info on their father, Abraham (my grandfather's 
brother), that they  had.   I wouldn't even know where or how to start 
looking for more info!
     
Sincerely,
     
Pearl
