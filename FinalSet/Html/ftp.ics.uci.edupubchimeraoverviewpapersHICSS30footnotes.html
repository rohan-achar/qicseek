<A NAME="footnote1">1.</A> This material is based upon work sponsored by the Air Force Materiel Command and the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract Number F30602-94-C-0218. The content of the information does not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the Government and no official endorsement should be inferred.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="footnote2">2.</A> All of the code snippets in this section have been simplified for demonstrational purposes. Error checking and event registration code has been removed and procedure calls have been inlined for clarity.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="footnote3">3.</A> Note, the fact the extended widget has a different name than the original widget implies that existing applications must be modified to take advantage of the hypermedia services. This is clearly a disadvantage since developers may decide the benefits of the integrated toolkit do not outweigh the effort required to modify their existing applications. Techniques for avoiding this limitation are considered in <A HREF="futurework.html#sec6.2">Section 6.2</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="footnote4">4.</A> See, for instance, the Abstract Factory pattern in [<A HREF="references.html#ref9">9</A>] for a potential object-oriented solution.
