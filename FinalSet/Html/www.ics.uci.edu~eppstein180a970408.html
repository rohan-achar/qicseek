Board representations</H2>

In order to operate, any
game program needs to be able to store and manipulate two kinds of objects: 
game positions, and game moves. These representations need to allow the 
program to perform the following operations:
<UL>
<LI>Make a given move (not just when user requests, but as part of search)
<LI>Undo a move (not just for user interface, needed in search)
<LI>Display board to user
<LI>Generate a list of all possible moves
<LI>Evaluate a board position
</UL>
Everything except displaying the board must be fast since it happens in the 
inner loops of the search routine.
(Board display can be slower since it doesn't happen often.)

<P>The internal representation of moves should be very concise (since 
we don't want to spend too much time generating long lists of moves) and quickly 
decodable.  But (very important) it should also able to represent all 
possible moves!  E.g.  for chess, a typical computer move representation is 
to store the starting square and ending square of the piece being moved; 
for instance the common beginning move of the king's pawn forward two 
squares would be represented "e2e4" where e2 is the name for the initial 
position of the pawn and e4 is the name for its final position.  The piece 
being captured (if any) does not need to be stored as part of the move 
since it is determined by the final position.  In the 
computer, these positions can be represented as 6-bit values, so the whole 
move could be stored internally as two bytes.  But (even though some 
programs are based on it) this representation is not quite capable of 
representing all moves!  In castling, two pieces move, a king and a rook, but we can handle 
this as a special case in which we list only the king movement. More 
importantly, if a pawn moves from the seventh rank to the eighth, it can be 
replaced by any of four pieces: queen, rook, knight, and bishop. The 
representation above doesn't allow us to specify which replacement is 
happening. So when designing a move representation, one should be careful 
to make sure that it covers all the special cases that might happen in 
your game.

<P>The onternal representation of board can be less concise but should still not 
be too huge.  It must represent all relevant information, not just all 
visible information, but not including irrelevant information.  E.g.  in 
chess, we need to know the positions of pieces on the board (the obvious 
visible information), but we also need to know some invisible information: 
who's on move, whether either player can castle, whether an en passant 
capture is possible, and how many moves it's been since the last capture or 
pawn move.  We also need to know something about what positions have 
occurred in the past (because of triple repetition) but don't need to know 
the entire list of past moves.

<H3>Example of  Multiple Representation Possibilities: Chess</H3>

There are many possible ways of representing even something with as 
clearly defined a structure as a chessboard in a computer.  Here are some 
of the methods that have been used by chess programs.

<P><B>Representation 1: 8x8 array of squares</B>.
Within each square, keep a value indicating which piece is present in the 
square
(e.g. enum { empty, wK, wN, wB, wR, wQ, wP, bK, bN, bR, bQ, bP }).  
Advantages: (1) simple. (2) easy to compute material scores:
<PRE>
    for  (i=0;i&lt;8;i++)
        for(j=0;j&lt;8;j++)
            score += value[square[i,j]];
</PRE>
It's a little messy but not really hard to compute possible moves; you can loop through the 
squares finding pieces of appropriate color and branch according to piece 
type:
<PRE>
    for  (i=0;i&lt;8;i++)
        for(j=0;j&lt;8;j++)
            switch (board[i,j]) {
            case wP:
                if (board[i+1,j] empty) generate move to (i+1,j)
                if (i==2 &amp;&amp; board[i+1,j] empty &amp;&amp; board[i+2,j] empty)
                    generate move to (i+2,j)
                if (j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; board[i+1,j-1] contains black piece)
                    generate capture of (i+1,j-1)
                if (j &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; board[i+1,j+1] contains black piece)
                    generate capture of (i+1,j+1)
                break;
            ...
            }
</PRE>
however there are various annoying boundary conditions to 
check (e.g. a pawn on rook-file shouldn't try to capture to one side) making 
this code complicated and slower than necessary.

<P><B>Representation 2: extended array</B>. 10x10, containing extra boundary squares 
containing a special "boundary" value added to the enum.  This simpifies 
some of the cases (reduces number of conditions in the if-statements above) 
at the expense of a little space.

<P><B>Representation 3: 0x88</B>.  The name of this representation comes 
from a trick for testing whether a square is a valid move involving the 
binary representation of the number 136 (which in hexadecimal is 0x88).
We give each square of the board a number (a single byte), of 
which the high 4 bits are the row and the low 4 bits are the column:
<PRE>
    112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119
    96  97  98  99  100 101 102 103
    80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87
    64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71
    48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55
    32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39
    16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
</PRE>
Then the square left of i is i-1, right is i+1, up is i+16, down is i-16 
etc.  Then represent the board as an 
array of 128 squares (of which 64 correspond to actual squares on the 
board).  The advantages of this representation are (1) it speeds up the 
program a little by using only one index instead of two in the array 
references, and (2) you can test really 
quickly and easily whether a move stays on the board: i is a legal board position if 
and only if (i&amp;0x88)==0.  [Work it out, moving off the board either 
overflows the column giving i&amp;0x08 nonzero, or overflows the row giving 
i&0x80 nonzero.]  This is a pretty commonly used technique.

<P><B>Representation 4: bitboards</B>.  I'll go into this in a lot more 
length than the other representations because it's probably more 
unfamiliar, but I think it's also likely to work better.  Instead of having 
an array of squares, each containing a piece types, have an array of piece 
types, each of which stores a packed array of bits listing the squares 
containing that piece.  Since there are 64 possible squares, each of these 
packed arrays can be stored in a 64-bit number (two 32-bit words).  The big 
advantage is that you can perform certain evaluation and move generation 
operations very quickly using bitwise Boolean operations.  Think of it as a 
way of getting your computer to do massively parallel computations by 
packing things into long words.  For example, in the following position:

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="970408.gif"></CENTER>

<P>The bitboard for the white pawns (call this 64-bit value "wP") would 
consist of the bits
<PRE>
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</PRE>
Then the bitboard squares occupied by black can be computed by a formula
<PRE>
    bOcc = bP | bN | bB | bR | bQ | bK
</PRE>
(where bP etc are bitboards for the different kinds of black pieces).
Similarly we can compute the white occupied squares, and or these two 
bitboards together to get all occupied squares.
The bitboard of possible white pawn one-square move destinations can then 
be computed by a formula:
<PRE>
    single_pawn_moves = (wP &lt;&lt; 8) &amp; ~occupied
</PRE>
Let's look at this in slow motion.
Shifting wP by 8 produces a bitboard of positions one place in front of 
each pawn:
<PRE>
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</PRE>
The negation of occupied gives a bitboard of empty squares:
<PRE>
    0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
    1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
    1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
    1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
    1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
    0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
    0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
</PRE>
The bitwise and of these two bitboards then gives the positions in front 
of a pawn, that are not already occupied:
<PRE>
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</PRE>
Similarly you can find two-square pawn moves by taking the bitboard of 
one-square moves, shifting it another 8 bits, anding it with the 
non-occupied squares again, and anding it with a constant bitboard (shown 
below) of the 
squares on the fourth row (the only row onto which pawns are allowed to 
move two squares):
<PRE>
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</PRE>
Note that this constant bitboard can be generated at compile time rather 
than each time we want to generate moves.
Pawn captures are similar (shift by seven or nine, and with a constant to 
eliminate captures off the left and right side of the board, and with bOcc).

<P>The point of this technique is not that your code is simpler when you 
program with bitboards (it's a little more complicated) but that you 
generate the pawn moves all at once rather than one at a time.  Also, a lot 
of the intermediate expressions you need (such as bOcc) get used over and 
over, and only need to be computed once. So bitboards end up being very 
efficient, and I think would be even better for games other than chess in 
which there are fewer types of pieces.

<P>One complication arises: it's often important to count the number of 
nonzero bits in a bitboard, or to find a nonzero bit (e.g. to turn the 
bitboard of possible pawn moves into an explicit list of moves).
Counting can be done one byte at a time, looking up in a 256-entry table 
the number of nonzero bits in each byte. There's a cute trick for finding 
a single nonzero bit: x^(x-1) (where the uparrow is C notation for 
exclusive or) gives a binary number 
...000111... where the first one of x^(x-1) is the last nonzero bit of  x.  If you need to 
turn this into an actual bit, take the result modulo some carefully chosen 
number M (for which the numbers ...000111... are all different mod M), and 
look the result up in a table.  As a simple example, the following code 
finds the index of the last nonzero bit of a byte:
<PRE>
    int T = { -1, 0, 7, 1, 3, -1, 6, 2, 5, 4, -1, -1 };
    int last_bit(unsigned char b) { return T[(b^(b-1)) % 11]; }
</PRE>

<H3>How to Undo?</H3>

Remember we said our board representation needed to handle undo operations.
There are
two possible methods: (1) Keep a stack in which each stack item holds a 
whole board representation; to make a move push it on the stack and to undo 
a move pop the stack. Probably this is too slow...
(2) Keep a stack storing only the move itself together with enough extra 
information to undo the move and restore all the information in the board 
position.  E.g. in chess you would need to store the identity of a 
captured piece (if any) and enough information to restore castling 
and en passant capturing privileges.

<H3>Repetition Detection</H3>

Some games e.g. Go, Chess have special rules about what happens when the 
same position is repeated (in chess, third repetition of a position gives 
the player making the repetition the right to declare a draw).  How to 
tell?  Short answer: make a hash function translating the position to a 
reasonably large number (we'll talk more about this later because this is 
also very important for speeding up the search). Then keep a list of the 
hash codes for previous game positions and test if your position shows up 
in it.  Typical hash function: make 64*13 table of  large random numbers; 
when piece x is on position y, look up table[x,y] and add it to hash 
ignoring overflow [Zobrist].  Note that, when making a move of a piece y
from positions x to z, you can update the hash very quickly:
just subtract table[x,y] and add table[z,y].
