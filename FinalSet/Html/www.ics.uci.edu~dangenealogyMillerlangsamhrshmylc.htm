Hi Moishe,
I am working on a tree for a fellow here on Long Island.(He has the tree, I
have the computer) He has a Langsam family in the Bronx, and I couldn't find
any information on your web page...So I'm hoping you have something in your
database that will help tell me more about the family.


I contacted Susan Wynne two years ago, and she wouldn't give me the time of
day...forget any help or information.


The attachment has all the basic info on it.


I will be sending photo's of headstones to you hoping you can tell me more
about the people.  The photo's are marked.


Thanks,


Carolyn Putterman
St. James, NY

Dear Carol,

I am fascinated by what you sent. I do not have a clear connection yet, but 
everything fits in with the family. We had MANY Hersh Mylech (Tzvi Elimelech) 
Langsam's in the family. Chunks of the tree came from both Kanczuga and 
Prezworsk.Can you provide siblings names or when these people came to the 
USA?

Please stay in touch. I would be interested to see any other scans you might 
have.

Thanks!
Moishe

Well Moishe, here it is......


Louis & Anna (Langsam) Katz both immigrated between 1888-1891.


I haven't determined if they were married in Poland or here in NY. I found
three Langsam ladies on the NYC marriage index, but none were Anna. (I do
have copies of those marriage records)


Their Children all born in NY
Harry - 1894 - 1961
Irving - 1896-1962
Agusta (Gussie) 1898-1988
Charles - 1901-1979
Molly Esther - 1903-1996
Morris - 1911-living
=========================================
Morris Waldman (his parents Joseph Waldman & Eva Berger)
He immigrated in 1888. Some of his children came in with him, and others
came in before 1891. From what I can determine, Rose Waldman and Anna
(Langsam) Katz may have come in together. Further work to be done at NARA.
The last one to arrive was Nathan in 1900 with a daughter Pauline. (Who does
not show up on the Ellis Island DataBase, but I did find him on the Holland
American Database at the NYCPL on microfiche).


My main question about Nathan is, who was he living with in Poland if the
rest of his family was here?   Morris Waldman's headstone alludes to him
being a Rabbi. He was not a Rabbi here, but a Kosher wine merchant on
Attorney Street.  Nathan born in Prezworsk, married a women from Krakow, a
Reisner, who could also be a Rabbinical Family.  I have always wondered if
Nathan was in studies for Rabbinical work, and wasn't very good at it, and
they threw him out�.if that is possible.


His Children that we know of�.could have had more in Poland
The range in DOB's kinda tells me he did have 2 wives and more kids.
Louis - 1862-1910
Fanny - 1866-1950
Jenny - 1875-1938
Nathan - 1876-1944
Rose - 1880-1940
Molly - 1885-1944


Rose Waldman and Anna Langsam were VERY close. From family members who knew
the ladies, "these two women were almost inseparable".  They lived within 2
blocks of each other in the Bronx.


Both families lived on the Lower East Side until the mid twenty's and moved
"en mass" to the Bronx.


I have six photos' I'll be sending to you.  I don't read Hebrew hopefully
you do. Maybe you can gleen some information from the stones.  Morris
Waldman's stone is hard to read in the photo's.  The fellow who translated
the stone was not good at it either. I sure would like a good translation
some day. He is buried at Union Fields Cemetery, Sinavar Cong. Anche
Sfaard - Section 54 - Row 1 Plot 5


I do thank you very much for getting back to me.


Carolyn

Hi,

Thanks SOOO much for all you have sent so far. Did Anna have any siblings? Can her 
son Morris tell us? What about here father, Tzvi Elimelech (Hersh Mylech), did he 
have any known siblings? Any known cousins. I do have someone else in the tree with 
that strange Hebrew name, Nentczia. Who did Gussie and Molly marry?

Also, Can you send me copies of the marriage records that you do have?

Please let me know how we can continue to work together. I will continue to review 
what I have in an effort to place this branch.

Moishe,
you will have to forgive me. I need some education....
Since I'm not Jewish, and not knowing the naming patterns for European
names, would his full name be R' Tzvi Elimelech Langsam?


Am reading the translations correctly....
none of the Langsam men I sent you are brothers, but are just three Langsam
men from Kanzuga.

Moishe,
I just went through some of my notes. And took another look at the death
certificate on Nentczia (Langsam)Katz.


When I was in Florida last year, I was speaking with the grandson of Louis
and Nentczia (Langsam)Katz.


He didn't think his great grandmothers name was Goldie Epstein but Rina
Tuchfeld who was the wife of Hirsh (Harry) Langsam, Nentczia's father.


I will see if I can get better information to confirm this.

Subject: RE: Kanczuga and Katz

Hi,
I think I may have a match. I found a Hersh Mylech, which is a nickname for Tzvi 
Elimelech. Tzvi in Hebrew means a deer. Hersh is the Yiddish word for deer. He 
was Kanczuga and was known by his middle name, Mylech. He was married to a Goldy, 
surname unknown. For some details, see H2 at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/reisl-h2.htm
If they are the same people, then Reisel is the sister of Anna.

Also, for the people living next door to the Rich's, please see H13 at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/efrm-h13.htm

Furthermore, is your Schoenfeld connected to my tree through his paternal line? 
I have MANY Schoenfeld's. Please see:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm

For another Nantze, please see
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/saml-h15.htm

Another startling concept, there are Reich's in the tree from Kanczuga as well. 
Again on page
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm
there is a daughter Baila, who had married R' Shimon Yeshaya Reich, had an 
unnamed daughter. This daughter had a son, R' Shimon Yeshaya Reich, who was 
judge (in Jewish court) in Kanczuga.

You can view
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/eidb.htm
and do a find on "Kan" to see Langsam's that came from Kanczuga.

I think this Morris is VERY important to us. Please try to find out more about 
his aunts or uncles. Who were his maternal grandfather's siblings? Does he know 
of any Langsam cousins?

Lastly (for now), do you have any of the death records for the Langsam's you 
found in the cemetery? 

Hope I have not overwhelmed you,
Moishe

Hi Moishe,
You haven't overwhelmed me....after doing this for many years, I have gotten
used to it.  The thing that is throwing me are the european names....do they
translate any way to the english language?


A call was made to Florida this am.  Morris Katz passed away about 8 months
ago.  A call is being made this pm to another family member to try and
retrieve information.


The Schoenfelds aka Shenfeld's were from Ropczyce, the Rich's aka Reich's
were from Sambor.


I'll let you know what transpires, and thanks for all the links....


I have never done a european genealogy before.  My tree is all USA back to
1673. I know my people are from England, but where....who knows. Working on
this tree I have enjoyed. Learning all the history, customs, geography
etc...

On three of the Waldman Death Certs, thee is a Paula/Pauline Grunberg listed

Moishe,


You have mentioned several times a town "ABD Rybotycze"
Is that the same as what is known today as Ropczyce?


I live very close to SUNY at Stony Brook. I found up there on microfiche the
following map:


Austro-Hungarian Monarchy  1875
by the Militargeographisches Institut.
Call No: G6480 s75.A84
Microfiche #A937.


I copied it while in Wash DC last month, but it is nice to know it is in my
back yard if I need it.  I'm in the process of scotch taping the sections
together to find the town the Waldman's came from.  Phonetically, it is
spelled Yel-schild. Got that pronunciation straight from a lady who's mother
was one of the Waldman's that immigrated in to the US. She just died about 9
months ago at the age of 98. Boy was she sharp of mind.


I have all the reference pages ready to fax to Mike after I send this note.
I don't get overwhelmed with information, but it will take him DAYS to
figure it out.

May I impose on you for some education?
Do these two names translate to Langsam?
Hersh Mylech or Tzvi Elimelech


If he was married to Goldy, that may be the Goldie Epstein on Anna (Langsam)
Katz's death certificate.


How does one translate the name Moritz Waldman?
If I know how it looks, then I know what I'm looking for when investegating

Hersh Mylech is a nickname for Tzvi Elimelech. These are both used as given 
names, not surnames. Langsam, a surname, translates from Yiddish or German 
to mean "slowly".

Moritz, a given name, can be any one of several Hebrew names, including Moshe 
or Menachem (Mendel).

Moishe,
I am looking over again the links you sent to me again.
On this one
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/reisl-h2.htm
you said "If they are the same people, then Reisel is the sister of Anna"


Have one small problem with it...you take a look at it again.


Reisel Langsam (Feb 20, 1864 - ?),
daughter of Meilach and Golda Langsam of Kanczuga, Poland,
Meliach Langsam passed away before his daughter was actually born.
This information comes from Polish records, as researched by Mr. Arye Barkai
and Ms. Suzan Wynne.


My Anna(Nentshya)Langsam was born September 15,1873
Meliach Langsam died 10 years before Anna was
born....unless of course Golda married another Meilach Langsam or Harry
Langsam....


Do you know if Reisel's American name was Bessie? There is an Isaac and
Bessie Adler buried in the same group as Nentshya at Mt Zion.

Read this....
*Anna (Nentshya) Langsam was with Louis Katz in Przemysl - They probably 
 were married there
*She was born September 15, 1873...fast math tells me that she 17 and 
 was married shortly before they sailed.
*The "Werkdendam" arrived in NYC on Sept 18th, 1891
That is if this whole thing is true....

I have some questions....

I was reading the Przemysl Memorial Book this pm
I don't understand the following entry...
LANGSAM	pg 286	Yehoshua Fisch (Langsam)
Why is the last name Langsam in perenthies?

I was reading the Spira pages you have on the web also. How come people
change their names?

Is there any published genealogies on the Kohain decendents or families?

Moishe,
I have gone through all the available pages on the web for the Langsams.


Have you been able to identify the parents of this listing from your Ellis
Island Data Base? Any idea where he is buried?


15      Aron Langsam    Barwald 1903    24      1879    Galicy, Hebrew  
         9 Feb 1903      M       15      M       Zieten
         Bremen, Germany 164     1
        Going to brother-in-law (?) Tuchfeld
        1 page  H36


I can't link him to any family you have posted.
Might have a good lead on some more Langsams.

Moishe,
I'm sending you three marriage records for Langsams in NYC.  I got these
through the FHL.


Are you OK?  You haven't answered my e-mail.

Hi Moishe,
On this entry you have on your data base....



15      Aron Langsam    Barwald 1903    24      1879    Galicy, Hebrew  
9 Feb 1903      M       15      M       Zieten

Louis Langsam was going to Abraham Tucheld's in Brooklyn. Abraham was
married to Minnie.


Per her Immigration on 3-13-1913 they lived at 193 Buffalo Ave, Brooklyn


Per the 1920 Census they lived at 7 Barrett St, Brooklyn


I don't know if you have access to Ancestry.com.  I do, and can get the
census records and any thing else they have from my home.


Hope this finds you well.
