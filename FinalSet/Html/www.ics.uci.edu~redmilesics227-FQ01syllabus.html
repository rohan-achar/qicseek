<H3>Catalog Description</H3>

<P>Exploration of current developemnts in systems and tools for
creation and run-time management of graphical user interfaces. Object
specification, constraint specification and maintenance, control
paradigms, separation of oncerns, support infrastructures, and
multi-media issues also are discussed.</P>

<H3>Redmiles' Description</H3>

<P>This class is about constructing software with a user
intefaces. That's obvious. But, in order to construct interactive
software, software engineers must have both the "right" perspective on
the design as well as knowledge of implementation platforms. Thus, we
will begin with a very generic question: what software should be built
(and inversely what software should not be built). In a sense we
follow a lifecycle of problem definition, requirements, design,
implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. </P>

<P>Students will implement a user interface software project over the
course of the quarter. They will participate in at least three
presentations about this project. The first presentation will be a
description of their project idea. The second will be a detailed
description (possibly as a collaborative presentation) of the
implmentation platform for the project. The third presentation will be
the final presentation of the project. The project will need to be
documented appropriately according to the developers' and users'
perspectives.</P>

<P>Generally, class will consist one-half to three-quarters of
discussion of a paper or papers with the remainder of the class
focusing on discussion of students' projects and status.</P>
