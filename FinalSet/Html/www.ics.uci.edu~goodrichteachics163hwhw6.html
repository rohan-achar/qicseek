<li>
<i>10 points.</i>
Use Kuratowski's Theorem to 
prove that the following graph, called Petersen's graph, is
nonplanar.

<li>
<i>10 points.</i>
Show how to draw each of the following graphs 
on the surface of a torus (i.e., a "donut" with a hole in the middle) 
so that no two two edges cross.
<ol type=a>
<li>
<i>K</i><sub>5</sub> 
<li>
<i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub> 
</ol>

<li>
<i>10 points.</i>
Draw a biconnected planar graph <i>G</i> 
with 10 vertices that has a separating cycle <i>C</i> with 6 vertices
such that there are 5 pieces with respect to <i>C</i> that induce an
interlacement graph with 6 edges.

<li>
<i>10 points.</i>
Give an example of a biconnected graph <i>G</i> and a separating cycle
<i>C</i> in <i>G</i> such that the interlacement graph for the pieces of 
<i>G</i> with respect to <i>C</i> has 
at least <i>cn</i><sup>2</sup> edges, for some constant <i>c</i> > 0.

<li>
<i>10 points.</i>
Let <i>P</i> be a piece of a biconnected graph with respect to a
cycle <i>C</i>:
<ol type=a>
<li> Show that if <i>P</i>
has at least one vertex, the number of edges of <i>P</i> is great
than or equal to the number of attachments of <i>P</i>.
<li> Show that the graph obtained by adding <i>P</i> to <i>C</i> is
biconnected.
