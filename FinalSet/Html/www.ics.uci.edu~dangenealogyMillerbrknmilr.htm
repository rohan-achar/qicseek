&#149; A <B>Miller</B> branch is from Belarus.
<BR> 
Samuel M�ller was born in Korotichi, Belarus, on March 23, 1897.
<A href="frm/fsamchay.htm"><IMG SRC="pic/psamuelk.jpg" ALIGN=absmiddle HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=12></A> 
Korotichi was a very small town. 
It is 101 kilometers East of Pinsk. He married Chaya Weinreb, of Erfurt, Germany. 
<A href="frm/fsamchay.htm"><IMG SRC="pic/pchaya_k.jpg" ALIGN=absmiddle HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=10></A> 
They lived in Cologne, Germany, where they raised a family. 
They were last known to have been in Gorlice, Poland, during the war. They never returned.
<A HREF="naftali.htm#L1.2.5.2.7">Chaskel Stengal</A> gave me their pictures. He took the pictures from 
the police station in Gorlice, right after the war. I have written to Korotichi and Cologne. The officials
at Cologne said there were no records of the M�ller's. The Korotichi archives are in Minsk. They wanted an
awful lot of money, just to see if they had any records from 1897. I have not pursued this further at this 
time.

&#149; According to some family members, <A HREF="raflmeir.htm#L1.2.1.6.4">Avrohm Abba Miller</A>
maintained that the famous cardiologist, Jose Meller, was related to us. I went to
visit Dr. Meller in the summer of 1994. He was kind enough to see me in his office.
He related that his family was from Zebrecen, Galicia. His father, Tzvi Elimelech (a
common name in our family), was born in 1905, and married Matil Bok. His parents were
Pinchus &amp; Rose. The majority of the family currently resides in Santiago, Chile. Dr.
Meller has a nephew there, Alan, who did some work on a family tree. I have
not been able to solicit a response from him.

&#149;Pesach Dovid is a unique name, particular to the Miller family. The bearers of the
name all have the namesake of <A HREF="homemilr.htm#PD">Pesach Dovid Miller</A>.
In addition, a large part of the family lived in Saros county, in the Bardejov
region. In the 1942 deportation records for Bardejov, there is a Pesach Dovid Friedman listed.
These are the particulars I could piece together:
Jozef Friedman, born 1866, of Bardejov, married	Betty Hollander/Holender
(born Sept 7, 1873 or Jun 20, 1875) of Zborov. They had several children.
One of them, Pesach Dovid, was born Oct. 12, 1902, in Bardejov. He married
Sarolta/Sara Beinhorn (b. Mar. 28, 1905) of Mukachevo. They had a son, Otto Aser
Friedman (b. Sept. 16, 1933) in Kosice. He is living somewhere in the Boston area 
but I have not been able to locate him. Pesach Dovid did have a living brother,
Samuel, who was not able to shed any light on his grandparents. A cursory check of
the Bardejov records from 1852-1895, held by the Mormon Family History Center, did
not reveal any more information.

&#149;I came to this tree through a few different branches that turned
out to be part of an entire tree. There are some conflicting opinions in the
various branches of this family regarding the big picture, so I will try to stay
clear of them. Here are the facts:
Yitzchok married Chaya Tzivya, and in 1830, in Strzyzow, they had Shabsi. He
married Frimit Licht, in Lezajsk, where they had 6 children. In age order, they are: Moshe (b. 1860), 
Mali, Yosef, Sara, Freida, &amp; Dovid (b. 1875). Mali, Shabsi's second child, was married (to a cousin, 
another [Shabsi?] Miller?). They had Chaim Yitzchok, in the 1870's, and several other children. Most of 
Mali's family died in a plague, in the early 1900's, in Lezajsk. In 1914, due to problems with the 
Russians, Shabsi returned home, to Strzyzow. He died there, at the age of 84, on the second day of Rosh 
Hashana, 1914. Several descendants of this family remember that they had cousins that are already
in our tree, making them definitely part of the big picture. It is possible that Chaya Tzivya, not her 
husband Yitzchok, was the Miller.
<BR>
<a href="rpsab.htm">Here</a> is an email collection from one of the family members.

&#149;<A HREF="shabsib.htm">Shabsi Yitzchok Miller</A> of Bukowsko had a daughter,
<A HREF="shabsib.htm#L1.2.2.8">Bayla Chaya</A>, who married Hersh Kahan. They lived
in Sighet, Rumania, where they had many children. I have not been able to locate
any living survivors of this family, although I have found a lot of information.
It seems that Hersh may have died before 1926. One of their daughters, Nissel
(Nellie; June 29, 1901 - August 30, 1990 [Hallandale, FL]), 
came to NYC on August 17, 1926. On the ship (SS Maurentania) manifest she
lists her mother's (Bayla Chaya) address as Sighatul Mantati Ilic Mares 24.
Nellie married Julius Harnik in 1938. They lived in the Bronx and later (1963?) moved to
Florida. They did not have children, but she did have a brother that lived in
Zichron Yakov, Israel, named Shabsi Kahane. He has a living son, named Tzvi.
His whereabouts are unknown. Nellie also had a niece from a sister, named Esther,
somewhere in Haifa, Israel, and a nephew somewhere in Long Island, NY. In September 1997 
I received a response from my inquiry to the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives in Israel. 
They told me of Bluma Zipkin, living in Tel-Aviv at 5 Kehilat Sofia Street. She is a 
daughter of Shabtaj Kohen and sister to Zwi. Although I dialed the phone number supplied 
for her many times, no one has ever picked up.<BR>

&#149;Meshulom Zeesa Susholz, a flour merchant, was married to Bayla Chaya (a very common name in the
<A HREF="shabsib.htm">Shabsi Yitzchok</A> branch of the family) Brand. They had
several children, including Esther, Yocheved, Itcha, and Pinchus Zev (b. 1901).
One of the children married a Miller. Pinchus Zev married Roiza Amkraut, and lived in
Kermanch (Komancza?), a <I>dorf</I> near Sanok, Galicia. They had 3 children, who currently reside
in Brooklyn, NY. The rest of this family was presumed perished in the Holocaust.
Pinchus Zev's children remember <A HREF="shabsib.htm#L1.2.2.5.2">Baila Horowitz</A>
as their cousin. I spoke with her son, R. Sholom, who told me that they are definitely
related through the Miller side, although he no longer remembers how. He said his
mother did know how.
<BR>I did find a Matilda Brand, of Pittsburgh, PA, who was from a family with an aunt, Brand,
married to a Susholz, from the Sanok region. She said she was currently overwhelmed with her
own research to be of much help to me. This was in February 1995. I forwarded copies of her
letter to Pinchus Zev's children, but I have not heard from anybody since then.

&#149;Izak Leib Muller, born around 1850, was married to Esther Yenta and they lived in Ganichi, Rumania.
They had 6 children: Yosef, Moshe, Avrohm Hersh, Volf, Rochel, and Faiga. Izak Leib's father may
have been either Moshe or Shlomo. Moshe has a son, Mendel Volf, who lived in Nyirbator, Hungary.
He remembers my great-grandfather, <A HREF="raflmeir.htm#L1.2.1.1.1">Pesach Dovid Miller</A>. He
knew that they were somehow cousins, but he does not know how.
<BR>I have been in contact with Dr. Ladislau Gyemant, a very talented researcher, in Rumania.
He was able to locate records regarding Izak Leib's children, but so far, nothing regarding
Izak Leib's ancestry has turned up.

&#149;I spoke with one of Zeesha Greenberg's sons, in July of 1996. He told me
the following narrative:
His great-grandfather (Meshulam?) Zeesha, died between 1905 &amp; 1911. He came to US once
and went right back to Lebeach, Galicia (near Rava-Russkaya, in the <I>Belze gaygen</I>).
He married Chaya Serel Meiller. Zeesha's father's
name is written down in a book, but the family can not find it.<BR>
Zeesha and Chaya Serel had a daughter, Mirel Nesha Miller,
married to Leib Greenberg. <B>His</B> death certificate states his mother's maiden 
name as Faiga Miller.
Mirel Nesha died 1944, in her 60's, in the US. She is buried in Bais Moshe Cemetery, in Long
Island, NY. She had a lot of brothers and sisters. 
Almost all her brothers perished in the Holocaust (1 was named Yankel Shmerel).
Some sisters survived, 1 in CA , 1 in TN. Also, 1 brother
in the US, Asher - died in US, had 1 son, possibly named Zeesha Miller.
They were all related to the Miller's from Nowy Sacz, and knew 
<A HREF="raflmeir.htm#L1.2.1.6.3">Akiva Miller</A>. I spoke to Akiva,
but he no longer knew the connection.<BR>
Mirel Nesha and Leib had about 10 children. 2 survived the Holocaust; Pesach &amp; Zeesha.
Zeesha's son, Meyer, had a son born and wanted to name him after his uncle, Pesach.
He asked his rebbe, who said to add a name because the uncle died before reaching 
60. Meyer knew he had a zeide, Asher. Meyer had an aunt 
over 90 (Pesach's wife, Surtcha). She said Asher was a <I>chushuva</I> (important) man, from a brother of 
the Bnei Yissochur. She said that she and Pesach were cousins from before marriage. This was told over by 
Chaim Dovid, her (Surtcha's) son.

Yussel (she thinks this was his name) married Sarah. They lived in Czarny

(Leah, Chaya, &amp; Sela). Leah married a Kalfus and lived somewhere in Czechoslovakia.
Chaya married a Stern and lived in Czarny Dunajec. Sally's mother, Sela (Faiga), as she called

Timberg, of Jaworzno (50 km WNW of Krakow), Galicia. They had 3 children, Dov, Sally

Chaim Miller, perished in the Holocaust. Sally &amp; her cousin Chaim, moved to Israel.
Sally lives in Brooklyn now. Chaim Miller lived in Ramat Gan, Israel. He passed away, but
is survived by a wife and 2 children.

Dear Mr. Langsam,
I am Gershon Lehrer ,live in Antwerp,Belgium and study in Israel.

I am being told (by Mr. Louis Schonfeld) of the existence of a discussion
group for people who research after descendants of the Bnay Yissachar
Zatsa"l.Could you please give me more information on the purpose of the
discussion group.

I am a grandson of the grandson of Yitschak Kallech who was a
grandson of Yaakov Uri who was a grandson of the Bnay
Yissachar Zatsa"l. 

By the way,I saw on your site that the name  Avrohm Abba Miller is being
mentioned. I am from my mother's site a descendant of Timberg whose family
originally comes from Krakow,Poland and lived afterwards in the
Netherlands/Belgium. In the Timberg family you find a few Abraham Abba's.
May be the name comes originally from the same roots as the name of
Avrohm Abba Miller comes?



With Friendly Regards,

Gershon Lehrer,

Hi,
Thanks for your inquiry. We do not have a formal discussion group, although I do maintain a website on the 
Pesach Langsam family, from whom I descend, through his oldest child, Avrohm Abba Miller (he took a different
surname). One of Avrohm Abba's brothers was R' Hersh Mylech Spira, the famed "Bnei Yissochur".  You can view 
some of the detail I have accumulated in my website at:
www.langsam.com
On the Timberg side, perhaps you can further identify a branch I have that I can not properly connect to the 
tree. The detail can be found within the site at:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/brknmilr.htm#A11
but it states:
"Before her passing, I spoke with Feigy Miller, the widow of Avrohm Abba Miller. She
 showed me his phone book. In it was listed a Sally (Sarah) Weiss. Next to her entry was
 written Abba's cousin. I called Mrs. Weiss on September 5, 1993. She told me that her mother's
 name was Sala (Tziporah). Sala's parents were Millers living in Poland. Mrs. Weiss said she was
 named after her grandmother, Sala's mother. I spoke with her again on January 1, 1997. She
 supplied the following information. Yussel (she thinks this was his name) married Sarah. They lived
 in Czarny Dunajec, Galicia, and they had five children; 2 boys (Dovid & another) and 3 girls (Leah,
 Chaya, & Sela). Leah married a Kalfus and lived somewhere in Czechoslovakia. Chaya married a
 Stern and lived in Czarny Dunajec. Sally's mother, Sela (Faiga), as she called her this time, was the
 youngest, born around 1900, married to Chezkel Timberg, of Jaworzno (50 km WNW of
 Krakow), Galicia. They had 3 children, Dov, Sally (Sarah), & Chaim. All the families, except for
 Sally, and a son of Dovid's, named Chaim Miller, perished in the Holocaust. Sally & her cousin
 Chaim, moved to Israel. Sally lives in Brooklyn now. Chaim Miller lived in Ramat Gan, Israel. He
 passed away, but is survived by a wife and 2 children. "

Regarding the Kallech branch, please see:

Could you perhaps supply me with more info on your family?

My maternal grandfather (Packter) was a son of Lea Packter.Lea 
      Packter's maidenname was Timberg.Her father was Shmuel Timberg.His
      father was Avrohm Abbe Timberg.I don't know a lot about the
      Timbergs but I know that they used to live in Belgium/The
      Netherlands.The Timberg's originally lived in Krakow,Poland.I think
      that it was a big family.

Right.

My paternal grandfather was Yissachar Beirish Lehrer z"l.His father
     was Gershon Lehrer z'l. (I am named after him.) His father was
     Yitschok Kallech z"l. He maried Itta (Itte) Lehrer.Thus my family
     name comes from her.
     (The rest you probably know ;
     The father of Yitschok Kallech was Shmuel Zenvil Kallech and his
     mother was Frida.The father of Frida was Rav Yakov Yentshi Ori and
     her mother was Lea Schonfeld (or may be Scheinfeld ?).The father of
     Lea was Moshe Schonfeld.Her mother was Soroh a daughter of the Bnei
     Yissachar Zatsa"l.)

him and asked if maybe we were related.  He said that a man
named &quot;Pesach Dovid Miller&quot; had once asked him the same
question (is this your brother? or cousin?) and that he was
born on Pesach and his mother liked the name Dovid, so no there
was no relationship.</PRE></CENTER>

Dear Mr. Miller.
By searching through the Internet (www.jewishgen.org) I found out that
you have a REBHUN connection.

My father's name is Moshe Aharon REBHUN born: 8/4/1919 in Nowy Sacz,
POLAND. His parents names are:-
-father Chune KELLER (REBHUN)
-mother Baile Dvora Wagschal.

From about 1920/1 they lived in Krakow, POLAND

Do you have any info regarding this REBHUN family and its roots.

Thank you very much

Hi,
Sorry for not answering till now.
I know very little about my father's family. My father is 80 years old and 
does not remember many things, his brother, who still alive is even older.
My father is Moshe Aharon Rebhun, he was born on 4.8.1919 in Nowy Sacz, 
Poland.They moved to Krakow at about 1920.
His father name was Chune Keller. Latter the last name of Chune's children 
was chanced to Wagschal, my father's mother maiden name. According to my 
father the name was chanced because his parents were married only by 
Jewish marriage. Latter on the last name was chanced to Rebhun, supposedly 
the last name of Chune Keller mother.
I do not know any further details about Chune Keller, not his parents 
names and not if he had brothers or sisters.

Attached hereinbelow please find some data from the Family Tree.

Best Regards. Should I find more info I shall certainly transfer this to 
you. Please do same to me.
Zviya Parnes (Rebhun).

Dear Mr. Miller,
My name is the same as the subject's and I am his grandson. Through him or
through his wife (?) Czarna I am probably related to rabbi Elimelech from
Lezjansk. Do you know anything about this? How are you related to the 
Rebhuns?
I am from Przemysl, Poland. I would appreciate a speedy reply. Please 
direct
your answer to JRebhun@Worldnet.att.net
This letter comes to you from the address of a friend, Auke@aol.com but
please answer to my own address.
Thank you very much,

Hi Mr. Miller

I found your website by putting my surname on a search engine.  I don't
know anything about the Millers, but my grandfather Samuel Rebhun was from
Galicia.  Could he have been a relative of the Rebhuns in your family tree?

> All 3 please.

Will do so.  I expect to put them in the mail Monday afternoon.

In looking at the JewishGen Family Finder, I noticed that
you have research interest in REBHUN.

My understanding is that Benjamin STERN
(father of Moses STERN, who was my mother's father)
had a sister, Malka STERN, who was married to a REBHUN.
Malka had children Yankl (who married Lola)
and another son (who married Ruth).
Ruth had a couple of daughters: Rachel (who married TAUBER)
and Esther (who married BRAUNSTEIN),
both of whom lived in Brooklyn as of 10 years ago.

Any additional information that you might have about the REBHUN
family tree would be most welcome.  It would be wonderful if
there was overlap between the REBHUNs that I know about and
those of whom you have knowledge.


Dan

Hi.


Sorry it has taken me so long to respond to you. 


I looked at your website and forwarded the info to my cousin who was born in 
Przemysl.  He reviewed the names and doesn't recognize any of them but the 
towns were very close.


I am meeting with another cousin, Albert Rebhun also of Los Angeles this 
weekend.  I will show him the info also and see if he recongnizes any 
connection.


Do you know about the Rebhun/Rebhan family book self-published about 20 years 
ago in Georgia?  I have seen a few pages of it and somehow must be related.  
I was told all REBHUN'S are related.


My grandfather, Irving Rebhun came from Rozwadow and Tarnow Poland.  He came 
to New York in 1926.  I think his brother Efraim survived but haven't 
researched that yet.


Please be in contact.


By the way, where do you live?

By the way, I am also related to the Halberstam family.  I know a branch 
survived the war and live in Paris.


Do you know anything about this family?
