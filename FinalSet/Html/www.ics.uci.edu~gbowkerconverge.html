<P>As information systems are used by more people, and permeate more of
our working and leisure lives, scholars studying the human side of computing
must scale up various concepts traditionally seen as individual or psychological.
For example, in discussing how human-computer interaction has changed as
a field, Grudin notes that it has gone from individual-screen to groups-groupware,
and now logically must seek to extend beyond the group into the wider social
sphere (1990). When large groups of people are using a widely distributed
system, old notions of "one person, one terminal" as the basis for design
are inadequate. Bannon (1990) makes a similar point in discussing his �pilgrim�s
progress� away from the individualized, cognitivist notions of HCI. Kling
and Scacchi�s classic notion, the "web of computing," seeks to expand beyond
the single user terminal and formal program stereotype to locate design
in a larger context of usability, the workplace and its social networks
(1982). King and Star (1990) apply the scale-up problem to decision support
systems, noting that the scale-up from decision support (DSS) to group
decision support (GDSS) to organizational decision support (ODSS) is a
complex one, involving issues of social justice, multiple interpretations,
and adjudication of conflict across social boundaries. Within the field
of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and the design of large-scale
information systems such as digital libraries, scale questions are at the
heart of design. What is the proper unit of analysis for design -- group,
organization, community, network? What does a community interface, or system,
even look like?

<P><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P>In this paper, we parallel these and other lines of scale inquiry about
information systems to ask similar questions about the concept of transparency.
A system is transparent if the user does not have to be bothered with the
underlying "stuff" driving it, just as an automobile is transparent when
one sits down, turns the key, and drives off without the foggiest notion
of how internal combustion works. Total transparency, like the ultimate
"killer app", is of course an ideal type, nowhere to be found in the real
world (everyone�s car stalls now and then, or has its little idiosyncrasies
requiring a deeper involvement with the tool). We define transparency here
to include the idea of relative usability, and computer tools and interfaces
which are basically ready to hand for some group of users.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Scaling of transparency means that we must have an idea about:

<P><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">for
whom (and when and where) is a particular tool transparent;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">what
happens when levels of transparency differ across involved groups;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">how
does something become invisibly usable at the individual, community, and
larger levels of scale, and with what differences in process and design
content?;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">how
are newcomers to a community taught how to make a tool, interface, or retrieval
system transparent?</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We seek in this paper to provide
a description of information interaction with which to understand the <I>continuum
of usefulness</I> of information organization and access. Transparency
and ease of use are products of an alignment of facets of information resources
and social practices; each of these facets are interrelated and in motion.
In scaling up transparency, we wish to avoid fallacies of universalism;
of an idealist concept of pure information devoid of locale or of the politics
of knowledge; or a scenario which begs questions of material resources
and infrastructure. Our research has been geared toward the real world
use and design of information systems. It is always embodied, always historical,
and always embedded in infrastructure.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">One impetus for clarifying a scaled-up
idea of transparency comes from changes in the information landscape itself.
In the current wave of building and research on digital libraries and information
infrastructure, we find places and possibilities where new kinds of arrangements
are being forged for information organization and access. Pockets that
have been semi-autonomous until now are getting interconnected, including
widespread federations of information repositories. One such example is
the Illinois Digital Library Initiative. One of the goals of this project
is to create seamless interconnection of federated repositories.<B> </B>Also,
traditional models of information retrieval are being turned completely
upside down; they can no longer presume an individual user, an information
intermediary such as a librarian, and a repository with discrete documents
which are then returned to the workplace or home. Information (documents
and multimedia) is being fractured and distributed in different ways across
the work-/play- scape. Thus a fuller understanding of people, their activities,
and the scaling of transparency is especially crucial for a social informatics
of digital libraries, but applies as well to other complex and large scale
information systems (Bishop and Star, 1996).</FONT>

of Social Worlds and Information Artifacts</FONT></B></LI>
</OL>
<FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We will explore in this paper
the use of the concept of convergence for understanding scaled up transparency.
It is a concept designed to bridge between social worlds (including membership
and practices) and information artifacts "Social world" is a term in sociology
first coined by Anselm Strauss (1978b). It refers to a group of people
joined by conventions, language, practices and technologies. It may or
may not be contained in a single spatial territory; in the modern world,
it typically is not. It is cognate with the notion of community of practice
(Lave and Wenger, 1992), and with reference groups. It was coined for social
analysis in order to speak to strong ties which are neither family nor
formal organization, nor voluntary association, and which may be highly
geographically dispersed. Examples of social worlds are stamp collectors,
rock climbers, activity theorists, and socialist feminists. Social worlds
may segment (divide into subgroups) or intersect (have partial overlapping
concerns); the degree to which they engage members or are voluntary is
variable (Star, 1994). We use the term information artifact to mean a wide
array of tools, systems, interfaces and devices for storing, tracking,
displaying and retrieving information, whether they be paper or electronic
or other materials.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman"><I>Convergence</I> as defined
in this paper is the double process by which information artifacts and
social worlds are fitted to each other and come together. On the one hand,
a given information artifact (a classification system, a database, an interface,
and so forth) is partially constitutive of some social world. That is to
say, the sharing of information resources and tools is a dimension of any
coherent social world - be it the world of homeless people in Los Angeles
sharing survival knowledge via street gossip, or the world of high energy
physicists sharing electronic preprints via the Los Alamos archive. On
the other hand, any given social world itself generates many interlinked
information artifacts. The social world creates through bricolage, a (loosely
coupled but relatively coherent) set of information resources and tools.
People without houses also log into the Internet, and physicists indulge
in street gossip at conferences - as well as engage in a whole set of other
information practices (Palmer, 1996). Put briefly, information artifacts
undergird social worlds, and social worlds undergird these same information
resources. We will use the concept of convergence to describe this process
of mutual constitution.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">In order to recognize this mutual
structuration, we employ a term used by Elfreda Chatman (1985, 1991, 1992)
- "information world." This term refers to all spheres of information resources
employed by an individual, organization, institution, or other group in
order to solve problems, learn, play, and work. They may be formal as in
libraries and databases, but they are also informal, as in asking one's
family and friends for opinions on health matters, or how to evaluate a
particular book or film. Such resources are also material, in the sense
that they are enabled and constrained by time, transportation, and material
cultural practices. Information artifacts and social worlds <I>converge</I>
to form information worlds in Chatman�s sense.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We will through three examples
explore how convergence occurs. First, we discuss how convergence is experienced
by individuals as academic researchers. Second, we examine a study of nursing
classification wherein nursing researchers are seeking to make their classification
of nursing activities part of the social worlds of professional medical
practice. Finally, we describe the convergence that subtends a global,
well established information collection and analysis system administered
by the World Health Organization- the International Classification of Disease.
This is convergence that goes beyond a single occupation, nationality,
or locale; in fact, it consists in the end of a number of intersecting
information worlds. It speaks to the ways in which multiple overlapping
systems support each other (that is, in the case of convergence; it could
of course go the other way with divergence and incompatible structures),
across significant space and time.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Through each case, we will examine
the operation of key feedback processes which underwrite the (ever partial)
fitting-together of social worlds and information artifacts. We will then
discuss how the concept of convergence can be of use in developing the
integration of sociological and informational analysis towards which much
recent work in library and information science has pointed.</FONT>

<P>Sometimes a person walks into a library (or other information system)
and it's just OBVIOUS how to find things. This is the person who can put
their fingers on things, who sits at the metaphorical center of the social
web, who can tweak a vast complex and mature system of social networks
to "get stuff." This is a person for whom the system is quite transparent.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>At the other end of the spectrum is the person who sees the information
system as confusing, chaotic, insurmountable, unusable; who tries to follow
given directions and misses by a mile and a half. Much professional socialization
concerns moving from this lost state into the state of obviousness or naturalness.
Analysis at this individual level asks how people adapt to, and work around,
formal structures when they don't fit; how they put together and maintain
networks which "feed" their work; and how to understand the interaction
between vernacular and formal systems of information and classification.
For example, professors will point to articles they review or items colleagues
send them as more important information resources than the library.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P>Convergence for the apprentice professional is a trajectory: the shaping
of the individual so that they see themselves as having the set of information
needs that can be met by their new social world's information resources.
As the individual moves along this trajectory, they both learn a field
that they can "put their mark" on and are changed by their socialization
so that their original "information needs" are not the same as their final
ones. For the individual, this feedback process, especially the ways in
which their own information needs change, is frequently invisible. People
often see themselves at the end of an academic question as asking the same
"big dumb question" (Linde, 1997) that they asked going in, without recognizing
that the constitution of the question has thoroughly changed through its
adaptation to their relevant information and social worlds.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Thirty-eight research scientists and students were interviewed for a
large information infrastructure building project over a three year period.
The goal of these individual interviews and focus groups was to learn more
about information finding behaviors of research scientists and students
as well as exploring their use of information systems. In line with established
research findings in user studies of information retrieval, most of the
senior-level respondents did not often use formalized information systems
(Taylor, 1991; Garvey and Griffith, 1980, Pinelli, 1991). These researchers
got the information they needed through an entire suite of other information
seeking activities, such that they rarely found themselves going out and
searching for anything. It was often difficult for these people to describe
how they had access to items that they needed, these were simply ready
to hand and a part of their immediate environment- transparent.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The means for making this information readily available is the stuff
of one's location at a particular point in the academic trajectory. It
involves insider, membership status in an academic community- the fact
of having been through the apprenticeship process. In this process, one
becomes attached to the installed base or the extant infrastructure of
academia. For example, membership in academia requires conference attendance,
an amount of discussion with colleagues, membership in various professional
organizations. One publishes in certain key journals and tracks career
paths through key institutions. In the digital library interviews, those
who had become professors had had to fulfill the taken for granted criteria
(a specified number of classes, exams passed, thesis completed). This necessitated
learning the map of the field, including salient research areas, acceptable
methods and methodologies, and proper vocabulary. They had to identify
a research area of interest and learn what in the field was relevant and
important, and so on. Collaborations, friendships, peers and colleagues
all add to the size and strength of the student's growing social network.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>With full membership, the professors information world takes shape through
the convergence of information artifacts and social world membership and
practices. Library services copy and send on needed articles; on-line archives
send automatic reminders of new work in the field. In our study, the professors
reviewed articles as well wrote them; often they had become journal editors.
Further along the career trajectory, they had participated in professional
governing bodies or perhaps served in a funding agency to shape future
research trends.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Through all of these levels of involvement, channels were established
along which information flowed. All of these processes of professionalization
and socialization into a social world enabled the convergence with information
artifacts. The workings of the profession into which academics enter solidly
embeds them in a community of exchange of information which happens (and
is expected to happen) on both formal and informal levels. In most ways,
knowing many members of one's research community and talking to them frequently
is more important than reading professional journals (Garvey and Griffith,
1971; Crane, 1972; Wolek and Griffith, 1980). Many respondents emphasized
that the idea is to know what will be in the journals before they are released.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Throughout their careers as students and in the process of becoming
professional, researchers focus their interests, which are represented
in collegial networks, in the piles and files of papers kept, in research
groups, and in journal publications. Thus people set up the means, artifacts,
and processes that were necessary for social world/information convergence.
The further one travels in the career line and into the more specialized
reaches of an academic specialty, the more intense the convergence becomes.
As Latour (1987) notes:

<P>There is a direct relationship between the size of the outside recruitment
of resources and the amount of work that can be done on the inside....an
isolated specialist is a contradiction in terms. Either you are isolated
and very quickly stop being a specialist, or you remain a specialist but
this means you are not isolated. (p. 152)

<P>This mutual reinforcement and the seeming seamlessness of the webs of
attachments of many researchers can also be their "Achilles' Heel." One
researcher pointed out that she did indeed rely almost entirely on her
network of contacts and subscriptions, and if those resources had holes
in than she would probably never know it. Reliance can become total (Swanson,
1986). In this way, too tight a convergence becomes over-determination;
it becomes a rut that cannot be broken free of. Overly tight coupling between
a social world and its information artifacts can be seen as a powerful
routine that closes off other possibilities of finding information or using
the imagination because they are not part of the routine. Bates (1979)
describes how these over-trodden paths of thinking can be broken specifically
for finding information. Campbell�s essay on the "fish-scale" approach
to interdisciplinary knowledge also intuits the value of partial overlaps
and a looser coupling between social worlds and information (Campbell,
1969).

<P>&nbsp;

<P>For the individual, while convergence can produce transparency and ease
of use, the opposite often occurs. This frequently is the experience of
newcomers to a social world, or those for whom the formal information systems
fail to convergence with the criteria of membership. This results in fracture
and frustration- a plight often felt by undergraduates. This person often
has no clear academic home, she may not even have a "major" field of study.
She does not know which the pertinent journals are, who the main people
are, nor even the language to use to learn these things. As we were told
in focus groups about what undergraduate's information needs are, "I just
need five references. Any five references. I want to get those as quickly
and as painlessly as possible." It does not matter who wrote the article,
when, or why. This situation is less one of apathy than one that is typical
of many undergraduates' relationship to the field of study. Those markers
and the community gestalt which define quality, relevance, and usefulness
are absent and thus irrelevant. If the new scholar learns and becomes a
member of a particular community through participation, as described above,
these community standards and needs become their own and at the same time
become attainable and sensible and eventually, transparent.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>As Lave and Wenger (1992) describe, "learning the ropes" of a new community
requires what they call legitimate peripheral participation. This is not
only, or even primarily obtained through watching, but through gradually
being made a fully participating member of a community through experience.
In this way a new member comes to know what being an insider in that community
is all about. The academic system is structured ideally to provide that
space to participate and learn for incoming students: to cause a convergence
between the student's developing academic, social, and artifactual worlds
and available information worlds. In practice, of course, as Lave and Wenger
(1992) and Eckert (1989) point out, the ideal is often not realized. Learning,
or information acquisition, are treated as if membership were not an important
factor, or as if students were not juggling multiple complex memberships.
The trajectory to convergence, when traveled, is rarely smooth.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>We will now turn to a second example of convergence, from the point
of view of a community of nurses. In this example, we will see the same
feedback process occurring through which the nursing profession, by attempting
to integrate into the professional world of medicine is shaping and being
shaped by the information world it is becoming part of.

<DIV ALIGN=right><I><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">(from a news
group discussing nursing interests and classification)</FONT></I></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN=right><I><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></I></DIV>
In this section we examine a social world and its attempts to create convergence
between information systems (specifically the classification of work and
its embodiment in accounting systems and research protocols) and clinical
practice.

<P>In their Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), a group of nursing
administrators are attempting to produce a standard list of everything
that nurses do in the course of their working day - from changing a bedpan
to giving an injection to telling a joke (McCloskey and Bulechek, 1996).
Why do they need a classification system? NIC's developers argue that nursing
has traditionally been literally `anomic' (without laws): in the sense
that no body of knowledge has been built up which can be moved from place
to place (cf. Turnbull, 1997 and Latour, 1987 on transporting local knowledge).
Julius Roth (1963) makes this point with respect to tuberculosis classification:
until a common classification of patient status had been introduced, no
patient could carry a single description of their condition with themselves;
and it was almost impossible to share information between institutions
- to build a community or shared language for comparison purposes.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The central argument the nursing researchers make is that they should
be represented in integrated hospital information systems, from which they
are currently absent. They need this for two reasons: first to act as a
basis for scientifically demonstrating the value of nursing within hospitals
(so that it can be properly `accounted for' and therefore receive proper
funding and recognition) and, second, to act as a basis for the development
of nursing knowledge: "Documentation of care with standardized classifications
allows for the integration of research and practice" (McCloskey, 1996:
14). Each of these goals - institutional and scientific - aims to describe
the way things are; each in practice also involves the operation of a principle
of convergence - which involves fundamental changes in nursing practice
and accounting. Looking at this example, we will see how the information
needs of the nurses are fitted to the professional worlds they are trying
to integrate with, at the same time as these worlds are themselves modifying
information systems so as to represent nursing. What is at stake is the
creation of an information world, where the practices of nurses can be
transparently represented in both hospital accounting schemes and in comparative
nursing research.

<P>NIC brings many threads of nursing practice together, into one, legitimated
form of representation. The creators of the classification have attempted
to include the many various practitioners and specialists in nursing, as
well as nursing educators and students. It will no longer be enough, argue
nursing informaticians, for nurses to act locally within the context of
their home institutions. In order for a body of nursing knowledge to be
built up, they will have to act the same as other nurses in other institutions.
When NIC wins the day, then they will have to perform sets of NIC interventions
specifically. This is further supported by the inclusion of NIC in nursing
classroom curricula. Thus the information tool (the classification system)
will change both nursing practice in the field and nursing training - the
users will be disciplined to both act and represent their actions in NIC
form.

<P>Further, the language of NIC will have to fit with the language of other
sciences:

<P>The most frequently focused upon language is that developed by medicine
and the numerous natural or physical sciences that contribute to medicine's
scientific knowledge base. This language is focused upon most frequently
by nurses, because of medicine's long history of dominance in nursing,
its relative specificity about physiological phenomena, its apparent measurability,
and its familiarity. It is also valued for its social status as a scientific
language, used by a politically powerful professional group, physicians.
(Kritek in Werely and Lang, 1988]<B>: </B>25).

<P>What this has meant is that nurses have, in building their information
infrastructure, emulated the successful research apparatus of other disciplines.
Nursing work is deliberately made, through the classification, to be subject
to scientific testing. The goal is on the one hand an informational one
- to create manipulatable data by ensuring comparability between nursing
interventions carried out at different local sites. But on the other hand,
and crucially for our analysis, it is at the same time an institutional
one - to make nursing 'look and feel' like other sciences (and in particular
medicine) so as to be able to tap the same set of accountability and accounting
information practices that the other sciences have so successfully developed
to justify their funding. They are working to make their classification
align with medical informatics and medical standardized languages by making
alliances and integrating themselves in other formal medical language systems.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The nurses promoting NIC clearly see that their classification must
become integrated with the rest of medical informatics at this higher level.
They argue that NIC must also become a part of not only the daily practice
of nurses, as well as nursing education, but it must also be accepted by
doctors and other health care professionals. They have in front of them
the specter of a failed classification system - one which developed without
the feedback from the wider setting which characterizes convergence. In
the case of a classification of nursing diagnoses (North American Nursing
Diagnosis Association), "When other professionals hear us use NANDA terms,
they about laugh us out of the hall because some of them [NANDA terms]
don't seem to be directly related to what we are talking about at all!"
(Interview with NIC developer, 1993).

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Nursing interventions need to be countable in the same accounts package
as medical interventions or pharmaceutical interventions. Nursing must
be described in the same ways as other activities in the medical setting:

<P>Without a unified language system that is integrated into other health
care standard initiatives, the nursing profession will not be able to use
the standard language developed in collaborative health care initiatives.
Nor will the unified language be capable of being integrated with other
developments in clinical practice, reimbursement formulae, or case simulation
models without a collaborative health care initiative (McCormick, 1988:
176).

<P>&nbsp;

<P>In general:

<P>It is not enough for nurses to accurately record what they do- they
must record it in a language acceptable to physicians and administrators,
and productive of a new, higher status. (Berg and Bowker, 1996).

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The feedback process between information needs, classification schemes,
and the wider professional communities with which nursing seeks to align,
produces a trajectory whose end result is both a nursing informatics that
can integrate with wider medical informatics and a nursing practice that
will be sensibly altered to permit this integration. The convergence here
is between information tracking systems and the social worlds of practicing
nurses -- a new kind of nursing information world, more broadly defined
and strategically situated.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>As in the case of the individual academic discussed above, then, professional
communities too find themselves struggling with transparency. Here the
issue is not so much one of membership, but of aligning information systems
and practice in such a way that the emerging information world is strategically
situated amongst other information worlds.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The fledgling academic must achieve transparency through learning and
professional socialization; the social world here achieves its transparency
through a series of translations and negotiations with its neighbors. In
neither case is the picture entirely deterministic - both the individual
and the social world have the ability to reconfigure the world(s) that
they are adjusting to: particularly as they become more mature. Howard
Becker�s analysis in <U>Art Worlds</U> (1982) notes the difference between
a naive and a maverick artist as precisely constituting this relationship
to the social world. Naive artists are not in dialogue with the reigning
artistic conventions; mavericks play with them and subvert them. Thus we
saw the academic becoming a reviewer or journal editor; we can see nursing
informaticians developing positions of influence within the wider informatics
field.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>A curious erasure of the learning and negotiating process often happens
over time. In both the individual and the community case there is frequently
a belief that all that is really happening is that the original questions
and goals are now being served by the information worlds that they are
now linked with. The achievement of transparency becomes naturalized --
this is just how the world is. For the mature researcher, it is easy to
forget barriers and blockages facing the newcomer; as social worlds converge
with wider-scale information systems, the categories come to seem entirely
natural, rather than negotiated (Bowker and Star, 1994; Becker, 1994).
In each case the operation of the feedback process of convergence has underwritten
the mutual fitting of a changed individual/community and a new information
world.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>In the following section, we will examine what convergence looks like
when social worlds are stitched together and overlap in yet larger information
systems. The International Classification of Disease (ICD) was first developed
over one hundred years ago, and today is used by such various groups as
epidemiologists in national health institutions and individual health practitioners
in small villages around the world.

<P><I><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Alain Desrosi&eacute;res (1988)
has shown beautifully how census breakdowns of the populations of German,
France and England have remained closely tied to the history of work, trade
unions and government intervention in those countries. We suggest that
as the ICD "naturally" becomes more universally applicable, this is partly
the result of the hidden spread of western values through the application
of our own bureaucratic techniques. These techniques appear rational and
general to us, but when looked at in detail prove highly contingent.</FONT></I>

<P><I><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">(Bowker and Star, 1994: 202)</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We will now move further out from
a focused social world, nursing, and sketch how multiple overlapping information
worlds are generated and supported through wider scale convergence. At
this overview level, we are concerned with the development of very large
scale information systems which are shared by many professions - for example
census data shared by economists, policy analysts, government agencies;
or biodiversity databases shared by environmentalists, biologists, community
groups and so forth. What emerges is that the same principle of mutual
feedback between the information artifacts and the social worlds occurs:
the wider collection of social worlds gets changed in just the same way
as the individual research or the professional community did in the process
of the development of a new information world. Transparency at this level
begins to merge with the very notion of infrastructure -- that which is
ready-to-hand across a wide scale of operation. Of course, it is a problematic
notion, given the complexity of transparencies in such heterogeneous mergers
(Star and Ruhleder, 1996, discuss this at some length).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Convergence here fits together
the representation of knowledge and the phenomena which are being represented,
through highly distributed knowledge systems. Consider for example job
classifications in Europe: there are large differences, as Desrosi&eacute;res
(1988) points out, between "professional" in England, and "cadre" in France.
Each classification system has been incorporated into a number of instruments
of government (such as the census) and into a series of organizational
decisions (for example the organization of trade unions). Each has spawned
its own particular varieties of statistical knowledge: epidemiologists
track stress, say, by socio-professional category; sociologists structure
their surveys using those same categories; government policy makers then
adopt the findings to target specific groups. While there is no "in principle'"difference
in social and political organization in England and France, two different
information worlds have historically reified two incommensurable subsets
of the population: and these subsets have <I>become</I> ever more real
and identifiable subsets as a result of this convergence. Is stress differently
distributed in England and France? The question becomes virtually inseparable
from the structuring of the information artifacts as well as from the practices
of the different social worlds employing them. When they converge within
nations, two different transparencies may emerge between countries. If
they are standardized across national boundaries, the transparency will
extend further.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">To explore this relationship between
knowledge and infrastructure further, we will turn our attention briefly
to the International Classification of Disease, tenth edition. The ICD
is one of a series of international classification systems that were developed
in the late nineteenth century - these ranged from classifications of labor
to freight packages to ears. (The shape of ears, originally thought to
be linked to types and degrees of criminality, became enshrined in the
classification of people in the collection of vital statistics and immigration.)
Each scheme involved the creation of a new international governing bodies
together with the development of an information world in which those bodies
could work. And many of the new classifications became strongly entrenched
in information gathering practices - for example, Bertillon's classification
of ears is still today the basis for the 'three quarter' photograph displayed
on US green cards.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">In the case of the ICD, the series
of overlapping communities that needed access to the same information world
(in order to co-ordinate their own professional activities) included -
but was by no means restricted to - the following:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman"><I>Epidemiologists</I> -- who
needed comparable data on diseases in different countries in order to discern
patterns in outbreaks and thence deduce causes;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman"><I>Public health officials --
</I>who needed to be able to patrol the boundaries of the nation and keep
out infectious immigrants; as well as monitor health conditions at home;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman"><I>Health insurance companies
--</I> who needed to be able to file data on diseases using doctors for
information collection purposes (and so needing to use a classification
system that doctors would understand)</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman"><I>Census officials </I>-- who
needed to create comparable international data sets in order to serve the
needs of the multiple professions that drew on the census.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">No one of these communities had
priority in the development of the ICD.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">To the contrary, the final classification
as it has developed has entrenched flaws from every perspective. Let us
consider two examples. First is the number of diseases that are coded for.
In order to get doctors (or, in outlying areas, lay personnel) to fill
in death certificates using the code, there must be a restricted number
of disease categories. This feature of medical practice is a blight for
epidemiologists, for whom a nuance in a particular classification might
well make a large difference in the context of a specific inquiry. Through
this case, however, we can see the operation of the same principle of convergence
that we have observed above. Over the past 100 years, doctors have been
trained in medical school into use of the ICD throughout their practice
- they use it in accounting forms, personal histories and death certificates.
They have fitted their practice so that they can support the use of a developing
ICD (which has grown consistently in scope and size and so become more
epidemiologically useful). Our second example is the use of the ICD in
the Third World. There is frequently a complaint in developing countries
that the ICD is not relevant to their interests - when people are dying
before they can be `accurately' diagnosed, what purpose is there in propagating
the system, they ask. They argue that the ICD does not represent their
own diseases. Against this view runs the Foucaldian (1991) observation
that it is precisely the ability of governments to count people, things,
diseases which is a feature of recent "development."</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">The key point for us is that as
the ICD gains a representational foothold in developing countries so at
the same time (and in pace) does Western medical practice, which itself
is tied to the ICD; and so ultimately does the ICD become the most apt
descriptor of disease. The disciplining of representational practice onto
a single classification scheme is tied directly to the spread of allopathic
medicine - and where allopathic medicine is fully practiced, the ICD provides
the best description of diseases. A continuing problem for the WHO comes
in trying to integrate traditional systems of medicine -- for example,
acupuncture has no category of disease per se, but a model of imbalances
of forces in the body. It is extremely difficult to map the one onto the
other in any simple sense without violating someone�s ontology. The ICD
comes as a package. It would be a mistake to see it as 'just' a classification
system that can be applied to as is to the Third World: it marks the convergence
of a social world and an extended system of information artifacts, including
death certificates, software, and the epidemiological record keeping of
the WHO.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Thus the development of the ICD
can be seen as the mutual inter-adjustment of multiple information worlds
in tune with the mutual inter-adjustment of multiple social worlds. Given
the complexity of the processes involved, the resultant large scale information
infrastructure is of course not seamless. However, it operates as efficiently
and reliably as it doubtless does precisely because of the continual feedback
process of convergence. In the case of large scale infrastructure, attachment
to the installed base, affiliation with multiple communities, and compatibility
with other systems of knowledge is necessary for success (Star and Ruhleder,
1996). As Bowker and Star (1994) have pointed out, the ICD's success, as
seen by its almost universal adaptation and use, is based as much on the
general westernization, industrialization, and bureaucratization of the
world as the classification itself. The ICD is a central point in an international
system of interlocking classifications and standardized medical languages
as well as a key structuring agent in medical linguistics generally.</FONT>

<B><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Ontological Status of
Convergence</FONT></FONT></B></LI>


<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We have looked briefly at three
examples of convergence, from the perspective of the individual and information
retrieval, a professional social world and its codification practices,
and large scale information infrastructure involving multiple social worlds.
We have witnessed some similar processes in each case, mediated by developing
information infrastructure: the world comes to look as if the convergent
description of it is accurate, and "natural." The degree of transparency
achieved in each case depends on location, strategy and politics. As one
scales up, transparency becomes more subject to contention arising from
the heterogeneity of the participating social worlds; once achieved, it
acquires considerable inertia and even coercive power. This finding is
akin to Star's handling of anomalies in <U>Regions of the Mind</U> (1989)
and Latour's analysis of scientific networks in <U>Science in Action</U>
(1987), and at the level of large scale control, with Foucault�s original
sense of discipline.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">At the same time, the co-creation
aspect of convergence is central to our argument here -- while transparency
may seem wholly natural, it is never inevitable or universal. In this we
follow Yates and Orlikowski�s use of Giddens� structuration model: structure
and agency are dialectical co-creations (Yates, 1989; Orlikowski, 1991;
Orlikowski and Yates, 1994; Davies and Mitchell 1994 use a similar approach).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">There is another powerful sociological
tradition that has looked at similar processes as a fundamental to social
stability: the functionalist tradition. For the purposes of dealing with
the intertwining of information and social worlds, we can trace this tradition
back to the path-breaking essay by Durkheim and Mauss (1963) through Evans-Pritchard
to Mary Douglas' own innovative (1986) work on `how institutions think'.
Durkheim and Mauss argued that at the root of primitive classifications
is a classification of social relationships: these are then projected onto
the world at large and read back into social discourse through the intermediary
of myth. Thus for Durkheim and Mauss it is not surprising that stories
about stars, the coyote, the origin of fire, and so on `converge' on the
same moral: since they are in fact the same social story told in different
`registers' (to borrow Levi-Strauss' (1973) phrase).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Mary Douglas (1986) felt no qualms
about bringing the lessons of Durkheim and Mauss right into the center
of our own social organization of information. Her position is simply that:
"How a system of knowledge gets off the ground is the same as the problem
of how any collective good is created" (45). Social institutions, she explains,
are about reducing entropy, and:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">the incipient institution needs
some stabilizing principle to stop its premature demise. That stabilizing
principle is the naturalization of social classifications. There needs
to be an analogy by which the formal structure of a crucial set of social
relations is found in the physical world, or in the supernatural world,
or in eternity, anywhere, so long as it is not seen as a socially contrived
arrangement. When the analogy is applied back and forth from one set of
social relations to another, and from these back to nature, its recurring
formal structure becomes easily recognized and endowed with self-validating
truth. (48).5</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Douglas is at her strongest when
she unflinchingly argues that basic classificatory judgments are social
in the sense that they are created, maintained and policed by institutions:
"Nothing else but institutions can define sameness. Similarity is an institution"
(55). The relevance of her position in our discussion of convergence is
clear: she is adopting the position - close to our own - that the development
of a single information world in any particular setting is not about the
enlightened discovery of the truth about the world but is rather a statement
about the consolidation of social institutions and information systems.
For us, it is this consolidation which explains some people's transparent
use of information infrastructure, and others' inability or lack of desire
to do so.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Where Douglas, like Durkheim and
Mauss, is weak is that she reifies `the social� and sets it apart from
technology (or information systems). She falls prey to Latour's (1993)
arguments against all great divides which engender determinism. On the
one hand, she defines society as apart from the existence of things-in-the-world;
but then for a causal argument, she has trouble setting `society' as determinant
on the one side of an equation and `the world' or `knowledge� on the other.
There has never been room for co-construction in this form of functionalist
argument. A related weakness is that, as with many functionalist positions,
she makes stability too much the norm. What needs explaining is not only
information convergence within a pocket of stability but also the lack
of convergence (and the preservation of an outsider status) within multiple
overlapping institutions. As sociologist Everett Hughes<B> </B>reminds
us, we need always to keep in mind that "it might have been otherwise."
Behind functionalism is the position that we all belong to one professional
world, one social class, one ethnicity and so forth - and that the alignment
of these memberships into a coherent social institution acts as unproblematic
guarantor for information convergence and thus transparency. Those for
whom this knowledge is not transparent are deviants. (Illustrative of this
point is functionalist sociologist Robert Merton�s categorization of scientific
discovery (novelty) <I>as </I>a form of deviance! (1973))</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">For all these criticisms, our
understanding of convergence is enhanced by Durkheim, Mauss, and Douglas'
work. It reminds us that convergence is a result of the consolidation of
social institutions. The information science literature also lends studies
of the multiple paths and means that information converges along- such
as colleague networks, personal collections, community practices (cf. Lancaster,
1995; Bishop and Star, 1996; Pinelli, 1991; Aloni, 1985; Garvey and Griffith,
1980). Network analyses have shown the importance of interconnections (Haythornthwaite,
1996; Wasserman, 1994; Scott, 1992), and the actor network perspective
(Latour, 1993; Callon, 1989; Latour, 1987; Callon, Law, Rip, 1986) has
demonstrated the importance of linking the non-humans to the previously
human centered networks. To these, we are adding that convergence is a
process in which status, cultural and community practices, resources, experience,
and information infrastructure work together to produce transparency within
an information world. Convergence is fully situated and is not universal,
nor is it exclusive. In times of change, it also has a certain fragility.
It is a situation, for the most part, of privilege.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">From a conservative point of view,
such "obviousness" or naturalness would mean successful integration with
the normative structure of social life. We do not wish to recapitulate
the recent history of American sociology -- people belong to many communities
of practice, and participate in many information worlds. Success is relative
and partial. For any given information world, the degree of convergence
is not a matter of "proper" socialization or internalization of the correct
norms. Rather, people balance conflicting requirements from different information
worlds; they may have good reasons (such as more important memberships)
for NOT undertaking pathways to membership or convergence (Becker, 1967);
or they may be excluded on other grounds such as gender, age or race. So
the situation of transparent, obvious, easy information retrieval on a
routine basis for work and play is in some ways a special case, and in
any event, in pure form is an analytic exercise.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Because social worlds and information
artifacts often do <I>not </I>converge, it is important to conceptualize
failures of transparency as well as the successful formation of information
worlds. Again, turning to the foundational work of Durkheim in sociology,
the term "anomie" seems suggestive of those situations where there is a
failure to converge.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Anomie in common parlance is thought
to mean something like "at loose ends." The Oxford English Dictionary lists
a range of definitions, beginning with a disregard of divine law, through
the 19th and 20th century sociological terms meaning an absence of accepted
social standards or values. Most sociologists associate the term with Durkheim,
who used the concept to speak of the ways in which an individual's actions
are matched, or integrated, with a system of social norms and practices.
In his famous <U>Suicide</U> (1897), Durkheim accounts for the lower suicide
rate among Catholics by noting the stricter, more binding and more clearly
specified sets of norms and practices affecting individuals, by contrast
with Protestants. When such a map for behavior is present, he argued, the
person is less likely to experience the angst of normlessness, less likely
to internalize a situation with no structure, and therefore less likely
to kill themselves. Durkheim�s work has been widely criticized on empirical
and methodological grounds. As well, we have the same criticisms of the
functionalist notion of mismatch as of convergence.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">At the same time, the word does
capture the sense of what happens with a profound mismatch between social
world and information artifacts. Certainly the dispirited undergraduates
we interviewed about library usage were experiencing anomie in the commonsense
meaning -- at loose ends.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Durkheim also formally posited
anomie as a mismatch, not simply as the absence of norms. Thus, a society
with too <U>much</U> rigidity and little individual discretion could also
produce a kind of anomie, a mismatch between individual circumstances and
larger social mores. Thus, fatalistic suicide arises when a person is too
rule-governed, when there is, in the words of Ricoeur (1988), no free horizon
of expectation.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Information anomie may arise when
there is an absence of social standards, guidance or values -- accepted
as useful by those successfully working with the system. It may also arise
when the system is <I>overly</I> rigid, allowing for no tailoring or customizing
to individual needs in a place of practice.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">The term anomie can carry a lot
of undesirable historical freight, such as the notion that there is one
right system and anomie is a deviant falling away from that perfect recipe;
similarly, the notion that there are "good users" and "bad users," the
latter of which are anomic (or deviant). Again, we do not wish to over
emphasize any centralized, too- rational or functional a priori visions
of any given system. Rather, the emphasis here is on the notion of mismatch,
a lack of convergence and on the senses of frustration, being lost, even
desperation which may result when there are mismatches between a system
and those who work with it. At higher levels of scale, it may mean the
exclusion or invisibility of whole social worlds or classes of people --
institutionalized opacity, rather than transparency (Star and Strauss,
in press).</FONT>

Information Science</FONT></FONT></B></LI>


<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Library and information science
research has dealt with most of the components or itemized examinations
of the contents of the information worlds to which we are referring. Descriptions
of how these components work together, and analysis of longer term interaction
of information resources and social worlds is becoming more important in
the field, as social informatics emerges as an increasingly important area.
In this section, we will describe how our model of convergence can be used
to situate the social informatics dimension of LIS research.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Many important studies in this
field are centered on items such as libraries, journals, and other formal
information systems. They are grounded in a model of a "user" first conceiving
of an information need, then going out and getting that information (Lancaster,
1995; Bates, 1989). The role of the information scientist (or intermediary)
is in between those two points, interpreting the information need, creating
and utilizing document surrogates, using or building a system to go and
retrieve an item that will satisfy the user's need for information. While
bringing attention to the often overlooked role of the user, research usually
questions the circumstances influencing the utility and effectiveness of
different forms of document and system use, representation, and retrieval
under different circumstances (Covi, 1996, Bates, 1989).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">The view these studies take is
often segmented along different axes, such as exploring the use of specific
document forms, or the use of single systems among particular communities
(Lancaster, 1995; Baym, 1995; Pinelli, 1991; Bizot, Smith, and Hill, 1991;
Aloni, 1985; Warden, 1981; Crane, 1972; and others.) Covi (1996, in press)
critiques the more segmented view as a "closed rational, or bounded database
perspective." Specifically, she defines this as a perspective that reviews
the use of a system as if that system were not situated in other resources
on and off- line as well as community norms and other social practices.
She calls for more use of the open and naturalistic inquiry which has recently
begun to appear. This integrated, naturalistic view as a departure for
LIS research is less common, although growing in interest and importance
in the LIS community (Bishop and Star, 1996).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We seek in the model presented
in this paper to include and add to the scope and perspective of current
understanding of information use. Indeed, they are complementary and supportive
to what we are saying; for example, the many studies that have demonstrated
the importance of colleague interaction for information exchange (Lancaster,
1995; Garvey and Griffith, 1980; Crane, 1972; Wolek and Griffith, 1980).
Others point to the significance of personal collections and resources
(Soper, 1976, Chatman, 1991, 1992). Also, the importance of physical proximity
in use of resources has been well documented for some time (Waples, 1932,
Hertz and Rubenstein, 1954; Rosenberg, 1966; Palmer, 1981; Pinelli, 1991;
Gould and Pearce, 1991). All of these point to the importance of and describe
the significance of various elements in information worlds, which we are
then drawing together.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Further complementary research
is found in the strong tradition of studies of communication patterns examining
the social networks of individuals. This particular thread of social network
analysis "is an approach and set of techniques used to study the exchange
of resources among actors" (Haythornthwaite, 1996: 1). It traces exchanges
between actors and finds patterns of relationships of exchange. These relationships
are synthesized into networks. These networks can be examined for patterns
of exchange of information. Relationships between "nodes" are measured
and evaluated for several properties, including strength, intensity, direction,
and content (Wasserman, 1994; Scott, 1992). Hesse, Sproull, Kiesler and
Wellman have all indicated how computer and social networks interpenetrate
in creating these relationships (Hesse, et al., 1993; Finholt and Sproull,
1990; Sproull and Kiesler, 1991). The development of the strength of these
ties points to the communicative processes associated with convergence;
further research into the similarities and differences between social networks
and social worlds would further specify these links.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">The advent of very wide scale
networked information systems has opened many new discussions about communities
and information. The possibility of information acquisition, retrieval,
and tailoring at the community level (including finding communities on
the Internet, designing for support for communities rather than individuals)
is an exciting one. Its success depends in part on the ability to design
to, and account for, the multiple levels discussed here. Not surprisingly,
we know the most about the individual level of information retrieval, access,
and use; some about the community or occupational level, particularly in
the areas of scientific communication; and we are just beginning to learn
about infrastructural convergence as a problem in design. Hanseth and Monteiro
(1996; Hanseth, 1996; Hanseth, Monteiro and Hatling, 1996) have begun a
series of investigations into information infrastructure and standardization
that addresses many of these issues. They argue in particular that the
tensions between standardization and flexibility in the creation of information
infrastructure is a key design factor, and that analysis of institutions
supporting the creations of standards and standardized classifications
is key to successful design in the networked computing environment. This
point receives support in Bowker and Star (1994; <B>1997</B>) and Star
and Ruhleder (1996).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Our goal is to tie these many
factors together into a holistic and dynamic model. As other researchers
(Bates, 1989; Covi, 1996, Covi and Kling, in press) have pointed out, search
and retrieval as a model is too simplistic, rational, and mechanical to
describe the dynamics of how people, groups, infrastructure come together
as resources. They are calling for study of the use of digital libraries
in terms of open natural systems and a social world perspective; looking
not only at the use of the system in terms of a bounded world and rational
actors, but rather at the physical and temporal workplace, the professional
field, and the occupational niche of the user (Covi, 1996; Covi and Kling,
in press). To this we are adding the idea that not only are these variables
crucial in understanding the use and usability of digital library systems
or other information systems, but also the amount of convergence or the
lack of convergence a person, community, or multiple communities are experiencing.
We are concerned not with cataloging the contents of information worlds
or with describing use of individual units therein, but rather how all
of these interact dynamically.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">But in addition, we are also sketching
out a larger framework. Search and retrieval are not compartmentalized
tasks, but rather, are products of social processes and relationships.
How an individual or a community or multiple communities are linked is
the result of the situatedness of each. Information is not a static product
that is "out there" waiting to be found, but is rather a construct of particular
situations at specific points in time. Convergence is a process by which
things come together through social process such as socialization into
a profession or the formation of a community with the co-construction of
information artifacts at different levels of scale.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">We know that there is no universal
scheme by which information may be made easily available to everyone. Some
systems of information organization are widely adopted, such as that of
the Library of Congress or the telephone book. However, as Berman (1981)
illustrates for the Library of Congress Subject Headings, these same headings
may carry with them systematic exclusions of points of view of ethnic minorities;
they overemphasize Western religions and do not well represent common names
for everyday objects. Similar points hold for other attempts to organize
and classify the world of knowledge. Current attempts to catalogue and
classify the chaos of the internet come nowhere near a universal organizational
scheme; if anything, they are proliferating towards "islands of indexing,"
despite powerful search engines and limitless hypertext.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">Rather than perceive this state
of affairs nihilistically, we have in this paper seen it as an opportunity
to understand something about the relationship between people, history,
information, and material and social order. While it is true that no one
scheme has yet worked for everyone, some schemes work reasonably well for
many people at particular times. If not absolute, there is sometimes relative
transparency at all levels of scale. In our work, studying designers and
users of information, we see "clear and present differences" between people
who are very comfortable within some world of information, who are "plugged
in" to a range of sources and are able to find all the information they
need easily; and those who are intimidated, confused, and limited by their
relationships to that same information. The differences are subtle, and
to some degree are hidden by models of individual user needs and concepts
such as levels of expertise (as transparency unmodified by time or place).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">This has given us some insight
into the locale of those on the outside, those experiencing a gap between
their social world�s practices and formal information systems. These differences
between insiders and outsiders are neither trivial nor easily understood.
Sometimes there are differences in career stage which explain relative
ease and familiarity - an old hand will more likely move easily through
a world of information than a novice, as we have noted. But not always,
if that world itself is shifting and changing rapidly, and training situations
favor students over professors. Sometimes there are insider/outsider differences
of the sort noted by Berman - systematic exclusions of members of a certain
group, or such differences in access to materials and infrastructure that
something like a digital library is a current impossibility. Sometimes
other memberships are more salient (Eckert, 1989).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">The greatest issue for the creation
of information systems is that these processes are invisible to traditional
requirements analysis; they can only be seen through the developmental
analysis of information worlds. Convergence often masquerades as naturalness.
It is not, but is rather the result of a particular configuration of relationships
between information and social order. Convergence is not interoperability,
but rather a layering up of solutions and conventions, and standards. Usability
is an emergent property which is not currently addressed in this fashion.
The reason why some things are obvious to some people and not to others
has to do with the connectedness that some people and not others experience
and the memberships that some have and not others.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="New York,Times New Roman">The challenge in understanding
and recognizing these differences is to design to them. This does not mean
creating "simple" versus "complex" interfaces to systems, but rather recognizing
the fundamentally different processes of searching and use germane to different
information worlds. Recognizing differences in needs implies building systems
that actually do different things. Unfortunately, many systems today do
not and often cannot take these different needs into account. The new relationships
and points of access being built and developed now benefit only a small
group of people at a particular place in their careers. Systems are now
being linked with hopes of interoperability without taking into account
the trajectories of information on a systemic or infrastructural level.
More than ever, the need for interdisciplinary teams for design and use
are called for to addressed the multifaceted nature of information -- a
social informatics.</FONT>
