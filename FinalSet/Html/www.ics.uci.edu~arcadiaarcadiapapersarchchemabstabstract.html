"<B>Formal Specification and Analysis of Software Architectures Using
the Chemical Abstract Machine Model</B>"</A>,

pages 373-386, April 1995.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

We are exploring an approach to formally specifying and analyzing software
architectures that is based on viewing software systems as chemicals whose
reactions are controlled by explicitly stated rules.  This powerful metaphor
was devised in the domain of theoretical computer science by Banatre and
Le Metayer and then reformulated as the Chemical Abstract Machine, or CHAM,
by Berry and Boudol.  The CHAM formalism provides a framework for developing
operational specifications that does not bias the described system toward any
particular computational model.  It also encourages the construction and use
of modular specifications at different levels of detail.  We illustrate the
use of the CHAM for architectural description and analysis by applying it to
two different architectures for a simple, but familiar, software system, the
multi-phase compiler.
