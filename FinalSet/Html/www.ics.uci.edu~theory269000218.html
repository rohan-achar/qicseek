Data ordering for visualization<br>
<a href="/~daveg/">Dave Goggin</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>This week's talk is about a problem of visualizing
document-keyword incidences by permuting rows and columns of 0-1
matrices. The permutation minimizing the length of the boundary
between 0's and 1's can be represented as a pair of optimum
traveling salesman paths in two Hamming spaces; one can then apply
various heuristics for approximate TSP solutions.</p>
