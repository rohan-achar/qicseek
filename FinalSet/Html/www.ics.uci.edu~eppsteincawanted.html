    <h1><span>Most Wanted</span></h1>

    <p><span>The following are cellular automata rules (<a href= 
    "lifelike.html">in standard semitotalistic rule notation</a>)
    which "seem like" they should have moving patterns (or for
    which it would be especially interesting to find such
    patterns), but for which my search software has been
    unsuccessful:</span></p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><b>B35/S234578<br />
        "land rush"</b></td>

        <td>Chaotic growth evolves into stable patchwork of
        horizontally and vertically plowed regions. Has various
        small oscillators including Life's clock, and arbitrarily
        high period oscillators via a simulation of the
        one-dimensional B01/S02 automaton (e.g. between two
        out-of-phase rows of farmland). Ok, maybe there's no reason
        for it to have gliders but it's one of the more interesting
        rules I've seen. The stable regions can have small
        oscillators in them, maybe there are gliders and more
        complicated patterns if we're given an initial background
        of farmland rather than blank space.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><b>B345/S5<br />
        "longlife"</b></td>

        <td>Complicated long-lived oscillating patterns of
        alternating rows seem to be trapped inside a bounding
        diamond. Are they really unable to grow?</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><b>B01345/S01234</b></td>

        <td>Most random initial configurations quickly decay into
        small oscillating blobs, mostly with period two. If the
        initial density is around 59%, the phase ambiguity leads to
        much larger intertwined black and white blobs with stable
        boundaries edged by higher period oscillators.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><b>B017/S1</b></td>

        <td>Random fields at 50% turn into grids of 4c/8 and 7c/14
        replicators blocked between small black blobs. Random
        fields at 25% turn into blobby unmoving mixtures of black
        and white areas. Very sparse random fields form grids of
        replicators again, gradually accumulating blobs where the
        replicators interact until all replicators are blocked
        between pairs of blobs. Except for the replicators, random
        patterns become static very quickly.</td>

        <td>Random fields at 25% turn into long-lasting blobs which
        decay into small low-period oscillators. Higher density
        random fields form a single large blob.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><b>B3/S23456</b></td>

        <td>An interesting mixture of slow chaotic accretion and
        horizontal and vertical shoots. When a chaotic blob meets a
        shoot, it can occasionally form a "runner" that grows along
        the shoot; when the runner catches up to the head of the
        shoot it starts a new blob of chaos. Also supports a few
        small oscillators including Life's clock. Very similar to
        B3/S012345678 "Life without death" which of course has no
        spaceships.</td>

        tree-like patterns of white dots. Has small oscillators of
        periods 3, 5, 6, 8, and 22.  Searched unsuccessfully with gfind

    <p><span>Even more than gliders for these rules, I would like a
    mathematical proof that certain rules (e.g. rules with B23,
    with B3 and none of S0-S5, or with all of B3/S34567) are unable
    to support gliders.</span></p>
