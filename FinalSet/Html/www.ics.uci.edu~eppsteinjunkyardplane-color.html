This is indeed a long standing problem. Usually stated as follows: Let G
be the graph with vertices the points of the plane and two points joined
if they are at distance one from each other. Then the question is: What
is the chromatic number of this graph?? (the smallest number of colours
with which the vertices can be coloured so that adjacent vertices have
different colours). This is one of Paul Erdos' pet problems and I have
heard him speak on it a couple of times. The known results (from memory
and now at least a couple of years old) are

(1) The graph can be 7-coloured  (try a hexagonal tessellation)
(2) There is a configuration that requires 4 colours (the one demanded
by the Putnam problem will do)

Thus, if chi is the chromatic number then  4 <U>&lt;</U> chi <U>&lt;</U> 7.

Other than that the true number could be anywhere... A typical combinatorial
puzzler - easy to state, impossible to prove. 

A further result due to Erdos is that if this graph requires k colours, then
some FINITE subgraph of it also requires k colours. However there is no
immediate reason to believe that if there IS a configuration that requires
5 colours then it is on less than &lt;billions&gt; of vertices  (substitute your
own large number).

Similar problems have also been studied for the integer line (where you
join two integers if they differ by an amount in some fixed set - say
{1,2,5} or whatever). 

This is all from memory and I have no references, so anyone with more
up-to-date info please feel free to correct me...

Here is a pretty good list of references for the chromatic number of
the plane (i.e., how many colors do you need so that no two points 1
away are the same color) up to around 1982 (though the publication
dates are up to 1985). This asks for the chromatic number of the graph
where two points in R^2 are connected if they are distance 1 apart.
Let this chromatic number be chi(2) and in general let chi(n) be the
chromatic number of R^n. By a theorem in [2] this is equivalent to
finding what the maximum chromatic number of a finite subgraph of this
infinite graph is.

    States that 3&lt;chi(n)&lt;8 and ``I am almost sure that chi(2)&gt;4.''
    States a question of L. Moser: Let R be large and S a measurable
    set in the circle of radius R so that no two points of S have
    distance 1. Denote by m(S) the measure of S. Determine

           Lim_{R =&gt; infty} max m(S)/R^2.

    Erd\"os conjectures that this limit is less than 1/4.

    Erd\"os asks the following: ``Let S be a subset of the plane. Join
    two points of S if their distances is 1. This gives a graph G(S).
    Assume that the girth (shortest circuit) of G(S) is k. Can its
    chromatic number be greater than 3? Wormald proved that such 
    a graph exists for k&lt;6. The problem is open for k&gt;5. Wormald
    suggested that this method may work for k=6, but probably a 
    new idea is needed for k&gt;6. A related (perhaps identical)
    question is: `Does G(S) have a subgraph that has girth k and
    chromatic number 4?' ''

\begin{sloppypar}

Euclidean Ramsey Theory started with the famous Hadwiger-Nelson problem:
how many colors are needed to color the points of the plane if no two points
at unit distance receive the same color.
After surveying some of the most important results in this field, we prove 
some new theorems in low dimensions.
For instance, for any rectangle $T$ and for any $2$-coloring of the points
of the $5$-dimensional Euclidean space, one can always find a
rectangle $T'$ congruent to $T$, all of whose vertices are of
the same color. 
This improves a result of 
Erd\H{o}s-Graham-Montgomery-Rothschild-Spencer-Straus.
