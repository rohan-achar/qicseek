<P>
Find out more about <A HREF="http://espnet.sportszone.com/soccer/">the greatest sport 
    that ever was! <img WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=36 HSPACE=6 src="soccerball.gif" border=0
ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></A>  
<P>
    BTW, I can't wait for the <A HREF="http://www.fifa.com/france98/index.france98.html">1998 World Cup <IMG border=0 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE HSPACE=6 SRC="france98.small.gif"></A> 
to begin! 
<P>
 In the meantime, 
<A HREF="http://www.euro96.org/"> the European Championships
    <img src="euro96.gif" height=80 width=60 border=0 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></A> will have to do - and they are already over!  How I'm going to keep myself busy
now is anybody's guess.

I'm a big <A HREF="http://www2.nando.net/SportServer/basketball/nba/phx.html">
<img src="suns.gif" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE border=0 HSPACE=6></A> fan, having lived in 
  <A HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/arizona/phoenix/">Phoenix</A> and all.  
<P>
They stink these days, but I'll never be one of them
fairweather fans.

Whenever I get a chance, I try and listen to <A
HREF="http://www.jimrome.com/">The Jungle</A>.  <A
HREF="http://www.jimrome.com/romey.html">Jim Rome</A>
is pretty funny, notwithstanding the fact that (or especially because) Jim 
"Chris" Everett decked him on live TV a couple of years back.

I watch way too much TV.  With the notable exception of <A HREF="http://www.nbc.com/entertainment/shows/seinfeld/index.html"><IMG SRC="seinfeld.jpg" border=0 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></A>, I don't believe any show on TV is nearly as funny as
<A HREF="http://MTV.com/mtv/tubescan/animation/beavbutt/"> <IMG border=0 SRC="BNBLOGO.GIF" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></A>. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://MTV.com/mtv/tubescan/animation/beavbutt/"> <IMG border=0 SRC="BEAVIS.GIF" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></A> and 
<A HREF="http://MTV.com/mtv/tubescan/animation/beavbutt/"> <IMG border=0 SRC="BUTTHEAD.GIF" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></A> 
are 
much more intelligent than people give them credit.  I
sometimes think that what bothers some about them is that, as repulsive as
they find these two, B&B-H provide both funny and accurate social commentary.
The truth hurts sometimes!

I recently had a chance to finally see 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~neno/guernica.jpg">Picasso's Guernica</a> 
in Madrid.  It left every bit as powerful an impression on me as I had
expected.
