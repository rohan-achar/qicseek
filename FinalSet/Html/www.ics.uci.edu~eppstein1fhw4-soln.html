<P>The circles in the following diagram represent the states of a Turing 
machine.  An arrow labeled "a/b,D" means that if the machine sees the 
character "a", it replaces it by "b", moves in direction D (either left 
or right), and changes state as indicated by the arrow.  An arrow labeled 
by "a/accept" or "a/reject" means the machine halts and accepts or rejects 
the string as indicated.  The unlabeled arrow indicates the start state.
A dash indicates the blank character.

<P><LI>Indicate for each of the following strings whether the machine above 
accepts, rejects, or goes into an infinite loop without halting: 01, 10, 
011, 001, 0011.

<P><FONT COLOR=RED><I>Note: there was a mistake in the Turing machine; the 
top arrow is supposed to be labeled "-/-,R" rather than "-/-,L".
Other than this mistake, the machine is essentially the same as one for 
recognizing strings of balanced parentheses (but with the character zero 
instead of left parentheses and the character one instead of right 
parentheses).  But because 
of this mistake, the problem was easier than it should have been.

<P>The answers for the machine given are that it rejects 10 and accepts all 
the other strings.

<P>The answers for the machine I intended to write are that it accepts 01 
and 0011, rejects 10 and 011, and goes into a loop for 001.

<P><LI>Find a Turing machine that accepts strings of 0's and 1's only when the 
number of 1's is a power of two.

<P><I>(Hint: repeatedly pass left-to-right 
across the string to test whether there is exactly one "1" left, and 
right-to-left across the string changing every other "1" into a "0").</I>

<P><LI>Why is it impossible to prove Church's thesis mathematically?
<P><FONT COLOR=RED><I>
Answer: because Church's thesis (namely, the idea that any computer we can 
actually build can be simulated by a Turing machine) is partially about 
the real world, and is therefore a statement of 
physics rather than purely mathematical.  Physical theories can be 
disproven by experiments but can never be proven mathematically.
