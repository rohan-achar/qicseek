<H1>Parking Information and Directions to the <br>
UC Irvine McDonnell Douglas Auditorium<br>
using an <i>IRUS Parking Permit</i></H1>


If this is your first visit to the UCI campus, you should be aware that
it is not easy to figure out the campus. We recommend that you get a 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html">
map</a> with building numbers.
 
<p>
Parking permits are required at UCI.
<p>

<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsors.html">
Corporate sponsors</a> should obtain a
a preferred IRUS parking permit from your

<p>

Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space, and to walk to the McDonnell Douglas Auditorium.

<b>From North</b><br>

<!-- (Alternate directions from North included below.) -->

<p>
These directions take you to the new entrance to UCI. This is the
quickest route. <br>
Note: There is currently nowhere to purchase a permit at this
entrance; have your preferred IRUS permit with you.
<p>

<blockquote>
Take the 405 South to the 73 South. <br> <br>
Take the Bison exit - the <i>last</i> exit before the toll road begins.<br> <br>
Go left onto Bison. <br> <br>
Go through the lighted intersection, into UCI. <br> <br>
Go right at the next lighted intersection (East/West Peltason Dr.).
<br> <br>
At the first stop sign (Los Trancos Rd.), make a left and park in lot 18/18A. 
 <br> <br>
You can park anywhere there is a red AR sign,
or in any unmarked space (but not in the space with the white VIP sign, 
metered spaces, or service spaces).
 <br> <br>
Note: If lot 18/18A is full, you can use the IRUS parking permit to park 
in lot 18C. To get to lot 18C, exit lot 18/18A and go left onto East 
Peltason. Go left at the next stop sign (Gabrielino Rd.) into lot 
18C.  As you enter, use the portion of the lot on the left. When you turn 
into that part of the lot, you will be facing the Engineering Gateway building.
