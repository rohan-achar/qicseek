</DIV>
If four circles are externally tangent in pairs forming a cycle
(i.e., AB, BC, CD, and DA are tangent), then their points of tangency also 
lie on a circle (shown in red below).  However, in contrast to the case for
<A HREF="three-circles.html">three tangent circles</A>, the circle through 
the tangencies is not necessarily perpendicular to the other circles.

<P>To prove that the red circle exists,
simply use <A HREF="inversion.html">inversion</A> to form a 
configuration in which A and C are the same size, at which point
the tangencies form a symmetrical trapezoid.

<P>This circle's existence is useful for constructing such a cycle of tangent 
circles, since it can be used to find one tangency point given the other 
three. In many other situations where one wants to find a circle tangent to 
two known circles, one can use this technique by forming a fourth circle 
with its tangencies on the line between the two known circle centers. The 
circle through the tangent points is also important in several <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-qpack.html">circle-packing 
mesh generation algorithms</A> as well as in a technique for <A 
HREF="http://daisy.uwaterloo.ca:80/~eddemain/papers/FUN98/paper.ps">folding 
a piece of paper so that one straight cut forms your favorite polygon</A>.

<P>The <A HREF="bisector.html">bisectors</A> of nonadjacent pairs among the 
four tangent circles are perpendicular to the other two circles and to each 
other, as can be seen by using <A HREF="inversion.html">inversion</A>
to transform one pair into either a pair of crossing lines or a pair of 
concentric circles (depending on whether or not they cross).
