Dear Moishe,


Tova Langsam married my ninth cousin twice removed (through the Teomim 
family) Yosef Rabinowicz (b. 1880).  Thus, she is not a relative of mine.  I 
could send you a GEDCOM file of what I have on his ancestors or their 
descendants if you're interested.  If you have information on their 
descendants I'd be interested.  (I checked your website but it said the index 
was under construction.)

Hi,

We have not written in a while. Do you know more about Tova Langsam and 
Yosef Rabinowicz? Where did they live? Marry? Pass on?

You offered a GEDCOM version? Would it be too much trouble to email me 
that piece?

Thanks!

Dear Moise,


As I may have mentioned, this is an extremely distant branch of my family (he 
was my ninth cousin twice removed).  Here's a GEDCOM file on what I have on 
their descendants.  I apologize if I didn't respond to an earlier request for 
it.

Moishe,


Thanks so much for your info!


Now that it is apparent that your wife
is related to the  Bochner family (by the 
way could you please tell me where in the tree
she fits in)


perhaps by a small miracle you can connect 
your Langsam family to this small subtree


Avraham Langsam
& Rechel Laia Strom
      Tova Langsam
      & Yosef Rabinowicz
            Leibus Rabinowicz
            & Fanny Faige Bochner



don't know anything about these Langsams but that
Yosef Rabinowicz and Tova lived in Gorlicz Poland
until shortly before 1939 when their son Leo(Leibus) 
a diamond merchant from London helped  
bring them to Tel Aviv area.


Do you recognize or know someone who recognizes 
these Langsams?

Hi,
Shana Tova!

Once again, thanks for all the input regarding this branch of your family. 
Can you supply the name and address/email of one of her descendents that may 
be able to assist in connecting Tova to my LANGSAM tree?

Thanks!

Hi,

One more thing. I notice that Leibus RABINOWICZ is listed as living on the JewishGen 
Family Tree of the Jewish People. Does he or any of his children have email? He himself 
should know who his grandparents were.

Thanks!

I doubt he is living since he was born in 1900.  I don't have any details on 
where his descendants may be living.

I should add that his son Norman David Rabinowitz was born in London (in 
1938), so you might try and English phone directory and see if you can find 
his address.

I found your website on the internet.... I am the daughter of Ernest and 
Ina Rabinowicz, grandaughter of Leibus and Fanny.  In case you are interested 
in updates, my grandfather passed away in March of 1992; my grandmother passed 
away in November of 1994. 
I have two children: Samuel Louis Raymond, born 4/17/84 in Cincinnati Ohio, 
and Sarah Chaya Raymond, born 6/19/86 also in Cincinnati.  There are numerous 
members of this generation, in the US, UK and Israel.  The current family 
geneologist is my first cousin Victoria Rabinowicz Katzman (married to Bob 
Katzman in August 2000).  She is responsible for managing the family tree 
and can give you names and dates.  Her email address is VKatgal@hotmail.com. 

Regards and thank you for a very interesting website-- Judy

Hi,
Thanks for your kind words and feedback. I would be very interested in 
pursuing further the ancestry of Tova Rabinowicz nee Langsam. Who were 
her parents? Where were they from? Did she have any siblings? Do you have 
any know LANGSAM cousins?

I have a website dedicated to the LANGSAM family at

The specific page within my site that deals with your family is

listed on your family tree (The Tova Rabinowicz nee Langsam Family
