Dynamic programming and optimal triangulation</h1>

<h2>1. Three seemingly unrelated problems.</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>Optimal scheduling of matrix multiplications</b><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<p> Matrices (two-dimensional arrays) can be multiplied by the
standard formulas from linear algebra: if A*B=C, then C[i,k] = sum
A[i,j]*B[j,k]. If A has dimensions x*y, and B has dimensions y*z,
then the time for performing these sums in the straightforward way
is O(x*y*z). There are more efficient but more complicated matrix
multiplication algorithms, but they're not really relevant for
today's lecture. Matrix multiplication has many applications
including computer graphs and relevance ranking for information
retrieval.</p>

<p> Now, suppose that you have more than two matrices to multiply.
Matrix multiplication obeys the associative law A*(B*C)=(A*B)*C, so
there's more than one order in which to do the multiplication.
However, the amount of time to do it might be very different. If,
say, A is 10*1000, B is 1000*4, and C is 4*200, then multiplying
A*(B*C) would take rougly 10*1000*200&nbsp;+&nbsp;1000*4*200
operations, while multiplying the other way as (A*B)*C would give
the much smaller number 10*1000*4&nbsp;+&nbsp;10*4*200.</p>

<p> More generally, you could be given a sequence of <i>n</i>
matrices M<sub>i</sub> to multiply, for i ranging from 1 to <i>
n</i>, where the sizes of the matrices are given by a
one-dimensional array D: each M<sub>i</sub> has dimensions
D[i-1]*D[i]. If you could spend a small amount of time planning the
optimal order to multiply these matrices, this could lead to a big
savings in the time to actually perform these multiplications.
However, the number of different multiplication orderings grows
exponentially in <i>n</i>, so it would take too long to examine
each one and determine its operation count. How can we find the
optimal multiplication ordering in an amount of time measured by a
slowly growing function of <i>n</i>?</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Optimal binary search tree construction</b><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<p> Suppose you have a situation where you will need to match input
text against a list of keywords. A standard technique for this is a
binary search tree: a tree in which each internal node represents
some string comparison, and each leaf represents one of the
keywords we are searching for. We perform a search by following
down a path in this tree, performing the indicated comparison at
each node, until we reach a leaf. To keep things simple for this
lecture, I'm going to assume that all comparisons are of type (a
<u>&lt;</u> b) or (a &lt; b) rather than allowing equality tests or
three-way comparisons, and that we will only search for strings
that are already in our list of keywords. Here's a simple
example:</p>

<br>
<div align="center"><img src="searchtree.png" width=533 height=151
alt="balanced search tree example"></div>

<p> The time to search for a given word is just the length of the
path from that word to the root; in this example, all words have
the same height, and all require three comparisons per search.
However, if we have some idea of the frequencies with which we'll
encounter each word, we can do better. The average search time
would then be sum p(i)*h(i) where p(i) is the frequency or
probability of seeing word i and h(i) is its height in the tree. If
some words (like apple) have relatively high frequencies, and
others (like cherimoya) have low ones, we can reduce the average
time by moving the high-frequency words higher in the tree, at the
expense of increasing the path lengths for the low-frequency
words:</p>

<br>
<div align="center"><img src="unbalst.png" width=533 height=241
alt="unbalanced search tree example"></div>

<p> So, if we are given a sequence of words, and the frequencies of
each word, how can we come up with an optimal search tree, one that
has the minimum possible value of sum p(i)*h(i)?</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Optimal triangulation of simple polygons</b><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<p> The finite element method is a technique for solving numerical
problems such as stress or heat flow simulations, that involves
dividing an input shape into simple elements such as triangles,
setting up a set of linear equations describing the relations
between the simulated quantities in each element, and solving these
equations. The solution time and accuracy both depend on the
quality of the triangulation: generally, it is desired that the
triangles be as close to equilateral as possible.</p>

<br>
<div align="center"><img src="triangulated.png" width=364 height=221
alt="triangulated polygon"></div>

<p> There has been a lot of work in the finite element mesh
generation community on how to measure mesh quality. One commonly
used measure for the quality of a single triangle is its area
divided by the sum of the squares of its three edge lengths. The
goal would then be to find a triangulation in which every triangle
has quality greater than some threshhold Q, and in which Q is as
large as possible; that is, we are trying to maximize the minimum
quality of any triangle.</p>

<p> A closely related problem of more theoretical interest is to
find the triangulation maximizing the sum of the lengths of all the
edges. One of the reasons this is interesting is that, when the
input is just a set of vertices and the triangulation must cover
their convex hull, we do not know the problem's complexity: we
don't have a polynomial time algorithm, nor a proof that it is
hard. However, for simple polygons (polygons without holes, in
which the triangulation vertices are only allowed to lie on polygon
vertices) both of these optimal triangulation problems can be
solved by dynamic programming.</p>
</dd>

<h2>2. Abstract formulation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>By viewing these problems more abstractly, we can view these
problems in a common framework. We take the point of view of the
third problem, optimal triangulation, but now we restrict our
attention to triangulations of regular polygons. We assume that
each possible triangle T in a triangulation has a quality q(T), and
that we have a binary operation @ that lets us combine the quality
of several triangles. We seek the triangulation of the regular <i>
n</i>-gon that minimizes or maximizes
q(T0)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(T1)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(T2)&nbsp;@&nbsp;... where T0,
T1, T2, etc., denote the triangles in our triangulation.</p>

<br>
 

<div align="center"><img src="regtri.png" width=361 height=354
alt="regular polygon triangulation"></div>

<p>In order for this to make sense independent of the indexing of
the triangles, the binary operation @ should be commutative and
associative. In all our examples, @ will be one of the sum,
minimum, or maximum operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>3. Relation of abstraction to initial problems</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>Optimal triangulation of simple polygons</b><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<p> It is most easy to see how this abstract problem matches the
optimal simple polygon triangulation problem. Each vertex of the
simple polygon can correspond one-for-one with a vertex of a
regular polygon, and this correspondence takes triangulations of
the simple polygon to triangulations of the regular polygon. For
the case of the max-min-quality triangulation, we can measure the
quality of a regular polygon triangle by examining the quality of
the corresponding triangle in the input, however if a triangle
would be disallowed because it crosses the input polygon's
boundary, we give the corresponding regular polygon triangle
quality zero. We let @=min and seek to maximize
q(T0)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(T1)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(t2)&nbsp;@&nbsp;... which is
just the minimum quality of any triangle in triangulation of the
input, or zero when the regular polygon triangulation does not
correspond to a triangulation of the input.</p>

<p> Similarly, to represent the minimum weight triangulation
problem, we let q(T) be the perimeter (or +infinity if the regular
polygon triangle corresponds to a triangle crossing the boundary of
the input polygon), let @=sum, and seek to minimize
q(T0)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(T1)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(t2)&nbsp;@&nbsp;..., which is
just the perimeter of the input polygon plus twice the weight of
the chosen diagonals.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Optimal binary search tree construction</b><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<p> To see how this regular polygon triangulation problem
corresponds to construction of optimal binary search trees, draw
the search tree words in order around the polygon's sides, except
for the top side which will correspond to the tree root. Form a
tree by placing a node in each triangle and connecting it across
the three sides of the triangle to neighboring nodes or to the
words outside the polygon.</p>

<br>
<div align="center"><img src="tri2bst.png" width=445 height=388
alt="binary search tree from triangulation"></div>

<p> Conversely, from any search tree we could reverse this process
and form a triangulation. The quality of a search tree is the sum
of the frequencies of the words under each node: @=sum, q(T)=sum of
frequencies of sides below the top edge of T in the triangulation.
To find an optimal binary search tree, we should look for the
triangulation minimizing
q(T0)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(T1)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(t2)&nbsp;@&nbsp;...</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Optimal scheduling of matrix multiplications</b><br>
</dt>

<dd>
<p> To view matrix multiplication ordering as an optimal
triangulation problem, label the sides of the regular polygon
(except the top) with the matrix names, and the vertices of the
polygon with the matrix dimensions. Label each diagonal of a
triangulation with the product of the two labels on the triangle
below it (below meaning opposite from the top edge).</p>

<br>
<div align="center"><img src="mmtri.png" width=416 height=410
alt="matrix multiplication ordering from triangulation"></div>

<p> The top edge will end up labeled with a formula for multiplying
all the matrices together. Conversely, from any such formula we can
determine a triangulation. To count the number of operations for
matrix multiplication, we should simply let @=sum and q(T) be the
product of the three numbers written at the corners of each
triangle T.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>4. Dynamic programming solution</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Recall that in any dynamic programming problem we want to
identify a set of subproblems to solve with the following
properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is only a small number of distinct subproblems.</li>

<li>The original problem, and each subproblem, can be solved
quickly once we know the values of certain smaller
subproblems.</li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm works by solving all the subproblems in a
systematic order, using an array to store all the subproblem
values. For these optimal triangulation problems, we define a
subproblem to be the optimal triangulation of the smaller polygon
lying below one of the diagonals of the original polygon. A
subproblem can be indexed by a pair of numbers: the positions of
the vertices on either end of the diagonal (these are the same
numbers we used to index array D in the matrix multiplication
problem). Each subproblem can be solved by trying all possibilities
for its top triangle, using the precomputed values of the smaller
subproblems on either side of the top triangle.</p>

<p>In the pseudocode below, the subproblem values are stored in an
array V[i,j]. The quality of a triangle is measured by a function
q(i,j,k), where i, j, and k are the positions of the three triangle
corners. We assume we are trying to minimize
q(T0)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(T1)&nbsp;@&nbsp;q(t2)&nbsp;@&nbsp;... as in
most of the applications above; it is trivial to modify the code to
maximize it instead (as in the mesh generation application). We use
Python syntax, with minor modifications such as the use of the @
operation and a more intuitive syntax for loops over integers
("for x < i < y" means that i takes on all integer values that make the
comparisons true). The
constant "id" denotes the identify element for the @ operation:
zero if @ is addition, -infinity if @ is maximization.</p>

<pre>
for n > i >= 0:
    for i < j <= n:
        if i == j-1:
            V[i,j] = id
        else:
            V[i,j] = min([q(i,k,j) @ V[i,j] @ V[j,k] for i < k < j])
</pre>

<p>The last line of the pseudocode constructs a list of j-i-1
values and finds the minimum value in the list. Here it is again
with that line expanded out into a loop of constant-time
operations:</p>

<pre>
for n > i >= 0:
    for i < j <= n:
        if i == j-1:
            V[i,j] = id
        else:
            V[i,j] = infinity
            for i < k < j:
                V[i,j] = min(V[i,j], q(i,k,j) @ V[i,k] @ V[k,j])
</pre>

<p>As a student pointed out in class, the outer loop needs to run
backwards so that all the smaller V[x,y] values will be available
when needed. Since the algorithm consists of three nested loops, each of
which iterates at most <i>n</i> times, the total time is
O(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>). As in the <a href= 
"/~eppstein/161/960229.html">longest common subsequence
problem</a>, this code merely computes the value of the optimal
solution; to find the solution itself involves a simple linear-time
backtracking procedure through the computed array values.</p>
