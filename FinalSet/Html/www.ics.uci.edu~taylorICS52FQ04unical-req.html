Until now, UCI has informed peopleof these events using a haphazard collection of e-mails, web pages,flyers, and word of mouth. However, as the campus grows, it becomesincreasingly more difficult to inform people of the many differentUCI events. UCI now wishes to supplement this process by creating auniversity calendar system, called UniCal, to inform interested partiesof campus events.</p><p>Because UCI is a research oriented institution, it does not want toburden its professors or students with production oriented softwareengineering projects. Consequently, it has hired Retro SoftwareInc. to develop this requirements specification for UniCal, as wellas its subsequent design and implementation. The information in thisrequirements specification is based on interviews conducted with therelevant parties at UCI, by the requirements engineers at Retro SoftwareInc. All information in this document was determined to be accurate atthe time of this writing.</p><p>This document contains the detailed requirements specification forUniCal that Retro Software Inc. is developing for UCI. The document shouldserve as the official basis for any further development of UniCal.</p><p>This document contains the following sections:</p><ul><li>Executive Summary</li><li>Application Context</li><li>Functional Requirements</li><li>Environmental Requirements</li><li>Software Qualities</li><li>Other Requirements</li><li>Time Schedule</li><li>Potential Risks</li><li>Future Changes</li><li>Glossary</li><li>References</li></ul><h2>Executive Summary</h2><p>UniCal aims to provide a solution for scheduling campus events andpublicizing their information to UCI faculty, staff, students, andvisitors. The application allows customers to schedule, share, and viewevents via any computer running UniCal. UniCal facilitates communicationby unifying and providing easy access to event information. Changes inevents will be updated to users' schedules so that everybody is wellinformed. By maintaining consistent and reliable event information,UniCal enables effective event arrangement and collaboration amongusers. Retro Software anticipates that the overall effect of adoptingUniCal will result in more accurate, efficient and convenient schedulecoordinating among UCI personnel.</p><p>UniCal provides the following key features:</p><dl><dt>Scheduling and sharing events</dt>  <dd>A user can schedule events and group them into specific categories using UniCal. These events can be seen by other users of the system.</dd><dt>Viewing events</dt>  <dd>A user can view all of the events in their calendar in either a weekly or monthly view.</dd><dt>Event reminders</dt>  <dd>UniCal will provide reminders for a user by playing a sound and displaying a pop-up window with details of the event at a customizable time interval before each event.</dd><dt>Task list</dt>  <dd>Users can also create a task list with deadlines and reminders to help them meet goals.</dd></dl><p>Some of the most important risks posed by the development of UniCal are the following:</p><dl><dt>Lack of adoption</dt>  <dd>Because there are many other calendaring systems currently on the market, it is possible that students, faculty, and staff will not adopt UniCal into their normal routine. This would effectively render the system as no more useful than current approaches to informing people of events.</dd><dt>Usability</dt>  <dd>help encourage adoption of the system, UniCal must be extremely intuitive and easy to use.</dd><dt>Rapid development</dt>  <dd>The schedule according to which UniCal will be developed is extremely aggressive to ensure that another company will not develop a similar product first and claim the market. Other qualities cannot be sacrificed as a result of this rapid development.</dd></dl><!--Although the contents of this document were thoroughly verified, it may still occur that some requirements are inconclusive or ambiguous. If it is so determined, it is requested that Retro Software Inc. be contacted via e-mail at shendric@uci.edu to resolve the issue.--><h2>Application Context</h2><p>UniCal will be used in the institutional environment, UC, Irvine,where scheduling and coordinating events can be difficult because ofthe large numbers of people involved. The introduction of UniCal shouldreduce the effort required to coordinate schedules among multiple peopleby automating much of the effort of keeping everyone's schedule up todate. Adopting UniCal will result in substantial change for UCI. It willrequire that the application be installed on each person's computer,and that the application be used as the primary means of scheduling andcoordinating events on campus.</p><p>Users of UniCal fall into two different roles: administrators, andusers: Administrators of UniCal have all of the same functionality as auser, but in addition are responsible for managing the different accountsof the system. They may create, delete, and edit user accounts, as wellas other administrator accounts. Should users forget their password, itis the responsibility of an administrator to reset their password so thatthey may once again gain access to the system. Should an administratorforget their password, they may have the password e-mailed to the e-mailaddress associated with their account.</p><p>Users of the UniCal system use the system to schedule and shareevents. Users may be faculty, staff, students, or even offices who wishto publicize office events. Users may create events, schedule remindersfor events, specify recurrences for events, and group events togetherinto categories. The categories that users create may be shared withother users of the system and included on their calendars. Users mayalso maintain a private task list of tasks that need to be completed.</p><p>It is the hope of UCI that UniCal will eventually be used by othercampuses. Such a change would require the application to be highlyscalable and likely require instances of the UniCal system to interoperatesince, due to political issues, it is unlikely that all campuses willshare one instance.</p><h2>Functional Requirements</h2><!-- look into setting up counter-increment/counter-reset with css --><ol><li>Data Entities  <ol><li>Accounts    <ol><li>each user of

Macintosh OS, UCI has decided that UniCal should be able to run onboth platforms.</p><p>UCI has also hired a consultant regarding programming languages, and,based on her report recommends that UniCal be implemented in Java, toensure portability across platforms as well as easy maintainability. Useof the JDK 1.4 is expected.</p><h2>Other Requirements</h2><p>Users should interface with UniCal through a stand alone applicationon their machines.</p><p>The cost of development for the UniCal system must not exceed$399,999.98. UCI has consulted with financial analysts to determinethat this is the maximum amount the system can cost without becomingunprofitable.</p><p>Retro Software Inc. should carefully document all decisions made,especially decisions pertaining to changes in this document (andsubsequent documents; always per agreement with UCI). </p><p>Retro Software Inc. will deliver detailed user manuals for the UniCal system.</p><h2>Software Qualities</h2><dl><dt>User-friendliness</dt>  <dd>Because many of UniCal's users are expected to be people with  minimal to no time to learn a complicated new system, it is imperative  that the system be as user-friendly as possible.</dd><dt>Correctness</dt>   <dd>Because UCI wants the system to be widely used, it is important  that UniCal perform all of its requirements correctly and does not  result in the proliferation of inaccurate or incomplete information.</dd><dt>Reliability</dt>   <dd>Reliability of UniCal is not essential, but nonetheless  important. The accepted rate of failure is one crash per month. Any  failure rate above this will create an unfavorable impression of UCI  towards Retro Software.</dd><dt>Performance</dt>  <dd>Performance is crucial to UniCal---if the system is too  slow, customers may revert to sending e-mails and using word of  mouth. Synchronizing events with UniCal should take no more than one  second for every fifty events. All other operations must be performed  nearly instantaneously.</dd><dt>Reusability</dt>  <dd>Reusability is important because it is hoped that UniCal will  eventually be adopted at all other UC campuses.</dd><dt>Extensibility</dt>  <dd>Several future enhancements for UniCal have already been proposed,  and there will undoubtedly be more forthcoming. Therefore, it is  critical that UniCal can be extended with relative ease.</dd><dt>Evolvability</dt>  <dd>UniCal is expected to undergo significant changes as UCI determines  which features are most important to its population. Evolvability is  central to this goal.</dd><dt>Robustness</dt>  <dd>UniCal must not crash if a user enters incorrect or invalid data,  or performs some otherwise unexpected action. A reasonable response  that allows the application to resume normal operation must be given.</dd><dt>Verifiability</dt>  <dd>Although it is preferable that the system undergo formal, thorough  verification and testing before deployment, this is not feasible with  the rigorous time schedule desired by UCI. However, extensive testing  of the accuracy of the system's functionality should be performed  before release.</dd><dt>Maintainability</dt>  <dd>UCI anticipates that UniCal will be used over long periods of time,  eventually by large numbers of users. Due to this fact, the likelihood  of several future enhancements, and the high probability of an equally  tight time schedule for their development, it is imperative that UniCal  be easily maintainable.</dd><dt>Reparability</dt>  <dd>Because UniCal is being developed under such a tight time schedule,  it is likely that testing will not be done as thoroughly as desired,  and some faults will make it into the product. Therefore, the system  must be easily repairable in order to fix these defects in a timely  manner so as not to disrupt the business of UCI.</dd><dt>Safety</dt>  <dd>Since UniCal is not a safety-critical application, there are no  safety concerns.</dd><dt>Portability</dt>  <dd>Even though UniCal will be implemented entirely in Java, a  highly portable language, portability will still need to be considered  in the design and implementation of the system. It is UCI's desire  that no features of UniCal will violate commonly accepted standards  for each platform.</dd><dt>Understandability</dt>  <dd>To support evolvability, reparability, and maintainability, it is  imperative that all aspects of UniCal be easily understood, even to  future developers who are not currently involved in the creation of  the system.</dd><dt>Interoperability</dt>  <dd>For this current set of requirements, the interoperability  of UniCal with any other application is not needed. However, it is  of prime importance that UniCal interoperate with other calendaring  systems in future versions.</dd><dt>Productivity</dt>  <dd>Because UCI would like to release the UniCal application as quickly  as possible, it is desirable that the productivity of all involved in  the development of UniCal be supported and facilitated with quality  processes and tools as much as possible. However, limited funding is  available for this requirement, so it must be foregone.</dd><dt>Size</dt>  <dd>Hard drive space and memory are abundant nowadays---size is not  an issue.</dd><dt>Scalability</dt>  <dd>It is important that UniCal be able to scale to support the entire  population of UCI, and perhaps, the UC system. Therefore, scalability  is an important issue to consider in the development of UniCal.</dd><dt>Timeliness</dt>  <dd>It is imperative that all artifacts of the UniCal system be  delivered on time.</dd><dt>Visibility</dt>  <dd>Due to the rigorous time schedule, extra time and effort to make  the project status visible should be forfeited.</dd></dl><h2>Time Schedule</h2><p>The development schedule for UniCal is as follows:</p><ul>  <li>Design must be completed by February 26th,  2004 at 2:00 PM.</li>  <li>Implementation and module testing must be completed by March 9th,  2004 at 2:00 PM.</li>  <li>System testing must be completed by March 18th, 2004 at 2:00 PM,  however this date may be changed.</li></ul><h2>Potential Risks</h2><dl><dt>Difficult to use</dt>  <dd>UniCal has a lot of features and addresses every kind of  user. Furthermore, a significant portion of its expected user base  is not computer literate. Hence, it is possible that some users might  find it too difficult to use UniCal.</dd><dt>Limited schedule</dt>  <dd>The schedule according to which UniCal is being developed is  extremely aggressive and may result in a product that does not  adequately satisfy the needs of UCI.</dd><dt>Lack of adequate support processes and tools</dt>  <dd>A project of this size would ideally be supported by a number  of quality software engineering processes and tools. Unfortunately,  UCI lacks the funds necessary to obtain these tools.</dd><dt>Privacy issues</dt>  <dd>As all categories will be viewable by every user, some users may  feel uncomfortable letting other people see their (private) events. This  could cause users to refrain from using UniCal.</dd></dl><h2>Future Changes</h2><dl><dt>Programmatic API for administrator functionality</dt>  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want to be able to programmatically  access administrator functionality so that the creation and removal  of user accounts can be done automatically by computers processing  incoming and outgoing students, staff, and faculty.</dd><dt>Web &amp; PDA interface</dt>  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want to create Web interfaces and PDA  interfaces to supplement UniCal.</dd><dt>Permissions</dt>  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want to introduce permissions to allow  users of UniCal to keep certain events private.</dd><dt>Interface with other calendaring applications</dt>  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want UniCal to interface with other  calendaring applications. Minimally this will involve sharing event  information such as through importing and exporting .vcal files (see  http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcal-10.txt). However, support of more automated  techniques such as scheduling meetings may also be desired.</dd></dl></body></html>
