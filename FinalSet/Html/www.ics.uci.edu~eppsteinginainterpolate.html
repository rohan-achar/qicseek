<H2>Interpolation and Extrapolation</H2>

In many areas ranging from <A HREF="carto.html">cartography</A> to <A
HREF="molmod.html">molecular imaging and modeling</A>, one finds the need to
fit a function or surface to a collection of scattered data points.
Interpolation refers to finding values for points between the given
points (i.e. inside their convex hull); if the function should extend
over a wider region of the input domain the problem is instead referred
to as extrapolation.  The method chosen should depend on the properties
one desires the resulting surface to have; many interpolation methods
are based on <A HREF="voronoi.html">Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay
triangulations</A>.  A piecewise constant approximation, used in
rainfall estimation, can be found by simply choosing the function value
in each Voronoi cell to be that of the cell's generating site.  This is
a analog for continuous domains of the nearest neighbor rule from
machine learning theory, which has been generalized e.g. to voting among
three nearest neighbors; one could similarly define median-of-three
interpolation schemes (still piecewise constant, but less susceptable to
erroneous data), however I know of no application in which such schemes
have been tried.  The Delaunay triangulation itself provides a piecewise
linear continuous function, defined within the convex hull of the input,
that minimizes a certain energy functional.  "Natural neighbor
interpolation" is defined for each point x by adding x as a site to the
Voronoi diagram of the original sites, and averaging the sites' values
weighted by the fraction of the cell for x previously covered by each
other cell.  This somewhat complicated procedure results in a continuous
function smooth everywhere except at the original sites.
At the 1995 ARO-MSI Worksh. on Comp. Geom.,
<A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/clarkson/index.html">Ken
Clarkson</A>
described a similar technique that results in a function
smooth everywhere.

visual effects by taking a random sample of pixels from a bitmap image,
computing the Voronoi diagram of the sample, and filling each cell
with the corresponding sample's color.  This appears to be what
Photoshop does in its "Pixelate->Crystalize" filter;
it can be thought of as a form of piecewise constant function interpolation.
