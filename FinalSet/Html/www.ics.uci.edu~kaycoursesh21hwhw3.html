<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6><B>Third Homework</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due at the start of lab on
Monday, October 12. There are fewer questions on this homework than on last week's, but the concepts (of working with lists) are fundamental to the rest of the cours.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(1) </B> If there were problems from
Chapter 6 that you didn't get through when you worked on the previous
homework assignment, be sure that you go through them now so that you
know how to do them. Likewise, make sure you can do all the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/scheme/finger.html">Scheme Finger Exercises</a>; you should have these concepts down as you start to work with lists.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(2)</B> As you read Chapter 9 of the HtDP
text, do exercises 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.2.3, and 9.5.2 (except write </FONT><font face="Courier New">how-many-strings</font><font face="Garamond" size=4> instead of 
</font><font face="Courier New">how-many-symbols</font><font face="Garamond" size=4>).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(3)</B>  As you read Chapter 10, do exercise 10.1.1.
As you look at exercises 10.1.2, 10.1.4, 10.1.5,
and 10.1.6 (which are assigned for the lab below), note that they perform
these related tasks:  Change every item (in 10.1.4), keep selected items
(in 10.1.5), substitute new values (in 10.1.6).  You&#39;ll see these patterns
over and over.  Determine which of those patterns exercise 10.1.7 follows
most closely.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Do exercises 10.2.1, 10.2.3, 10.2.4,
10.2.5, 10.2.6, and 10.2.8, all of which are similar to the restaurant examples
we did in class.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(4)</B>  In Chapter 11, the authors use
the concepts we already know to define the natural numbers.  Even if you
don&#39;t find number theory particularly compelling, you might appreciate
how elegantly it all fits together.</FONT><BR />
