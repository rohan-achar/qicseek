<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Course goals:</B>  This course is the first
of a three-quarter sequence introducing the field of informatics-- computer
science with an emphasis on software and systems design and the human, organizational,
and social context surrounding what we design.  This course will not only
broaden your technical horizons but also focus on systematic problem solving.
 We welcome you and we hope you enjoy it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course
does not expect any previous experience in computer science or computer
programming.  If you do have some experience, you will find some topics
familiar but many others will certainly be new to you.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We do expect each student to be able to navigate
the Windows XP systems in our labs, to navigate the World-Wide Web, to download
and read documents in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, and to read and send electronic
mail.  Some of our assignments will require these skills.  If you need to
pick these skills up or sharpen them, do it in the first week of the quarter;
speak with us if you need a hand.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets
six hours each week:  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 to 12:20 in HH 262
and also from 2:00 to 3:20 in CS 180. At present there are two discussion/lab
sections:
<BR>
1. &#160; MWF 3:00-4:50, starting in CS 219 and continuing in CS 192
<BR>
2. &#160; MWF 5:00-6:50, starting in CS 213 and continuing in CS 192.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Most of your lab work will be done in pairs,
so you should plan always to attend your scheduled lab times so you can
work with your partner.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop
by my office at any time.  If I&#39;m there and not immersed in something
else, I&#39;ll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.
 I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,
during which course-related matters will have first priority:  Wednesdays
from 9:30 to 9:55 and Thursdays from 10:00 to 10:45. Of course emergencies
may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.  I&#39;ll
also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week.  The
quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described
below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the
ID </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="mailto:i41@uci.edu">i41@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">.
 This goes to both of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you
need to reach one of us individually, use our individual IDs listed above.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We may also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email daily.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).   Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official
announcements, your grade could suffer. If you prefer to read your Email
on another account, forwarding instructions appear below.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Textbook:</B><I> How to Design Programs,</I>
by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi.  You will also find the
full text of the book on the web at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.htdp.org">http://www.htdp.org</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">,
along with errata, code for the book&#39;s examples, and a guide to using
the DrScheme software.  The on-line version is slightly more current than
the print version, but many people find it tiresome to read long technical
material on the screen.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">At </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/refs.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/refs.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
is a list of supplementary references on course topics.  These are not required
reading (unless we tell you otherwise later).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Labs and lab hours:</B> Of course you will
need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday/Wednesday/Friday
lab hours.  Students in Informatics 41 may use any of the school&#39;s instructional
computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the
lab exclusively.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
for lab hours and other information.   Note in particular that all ICS labs
are closed on university holidays, such as the Friday after Thanksgiving
(but not the Saturday and Sunday).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Please remember that programming tasks always
take longer to complete than you think they will, no matter how much experience
you have.  You must account for this as you plan your time; we cannot accept
busy schedules or time mismanagement as an excuse for late or incomplete
assignments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Course structure:
<BR>
</B><I><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/index.html">Weekly assignments</A>,</I>
some on paper and some on line (25% of the course grade). All the assignments
will be available at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
.
<BR>
<I>Class participation:</I>  Based primarily on participating consistently
and effectively in the lab (10%).
<BR>
<I>Weekly quizzes:  </I>Given in lecture every Tuesday morning at 11:00
(30% together).   Last year&#39;s quizzes are available on the web at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/quiz/old">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/quiz/old</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">;
they&#39;re an excellent way to prepare and review (but they won&#39;t perfectly
mirror the form and content of this year&#39;s quizzes).
<BR>
<I>One final exam:</I>  On Tuesday, December 6, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. (35%).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We determine final grades neither on a formal
curve (with equal numbers of As and Fs, Bs and Ds, etc.) nor on a fixed,
straight scale.  Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated,
but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been lower; this means that
you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates.
 If you&#39;re concerned, check with your TA or the instructor.  The basic
scale is:  grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases, A+),
90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%-90%; grades in the C range, 70%-80%.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating
your work; go to him first for any questions about grading or scoring. 
If that does not resolve your question, then see the instructor.  The TA
and instructor will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we
must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the
item is returned; the course moves quickly, and we simply can&#39;t deal
with assignments long past.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We&#39;re required to say that in unusual circumstances,
these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to happen.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>What to do this week to get started in Informatics
41:
<BR>
</B>-- If you do not have a UCInet ID (an account on the EA system for reading
electronic mail), get one.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://activate.uci.edu/">http://activate.uci.edu/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
.
<BR>
-- If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your
UCInet account, redirect your mail at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.nacs.uci.edu/email/forward.html">http://www.nacs.uci.edu/email/forward.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
.
<BR>
-- If you do not have an ICS account for access to the Windows network in
ICS, get one.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/account_faq.php">http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/account_faq.php</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
.
<BR>
-- On the Web, go to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>checkmate.ics.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">,
log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing,&quot; click &quot;Go&quot;
next to Informatics 41, and then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot;
 You&#39;ll submit some of your work electronically; this step is necessary
to set that up.
<BR>
-- Get a lab printing key-card if you plan to do any printing in the lab.
<BR>
-- Give a snapshot of yourself (with your name written on the back) to your
TA.  This will help us learn your names quickly.  (This is not just for
fun--it&#39;s a course requirement.)  Also turn in your signed Questionnaire
to your TA in discussion section.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Good advice and helpful hints:  </B>Make
every effort to attend the lectures; we will often cover material that isn&#39;t
directly in the textbook.  It&#39;s not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat
lecture material you missed, though of course he will answer questions about
it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Attend your discussion and lab section, too;
assignments will be discussed and completed there, exams will be reviewed
there, and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture.
 Don&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you. 
Since most of your work will be done with a partner, your partner also depends
on your consistent presence.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Check your electronic mail regularly; this
is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need it
to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed
pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.  You
will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts
that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">The assignments, like all technical specifications,
require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back
to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about
what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure
to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Start each assignment early.  Assignments will
be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every
day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,
even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll
have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">If you find yourself having trouble or getting
behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.
 But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and
turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on
a lab assignment.  ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more
complete discussion, see the ICS departmental web page covering academic
honesty issues (</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php">http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you
have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something
rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances
you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the
due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date
comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes; zeroes (especially more than
one of them) significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the
shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),
we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>
