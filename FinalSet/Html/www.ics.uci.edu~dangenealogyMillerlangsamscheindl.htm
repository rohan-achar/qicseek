My grandmother was born in 1898 in a little village about 21 km East of
Sanok.
It is called Tyreva Woleska.{sp} In 1920 she got married and moved to Sanok.
Her husband was Zacharia Fink. They lived in Sanok till 1939.
My grandmother Scheindl Langsam had 9 brothers and sisters.She and 3 others,
along
with others from our family all moved to Winnipeg around 1948,1949. Scheindl
died in 1960.
In Sanok, my grandfather was in the meat business. They had  5 children, one
of them my mother. 1 child died in the war, the others are all in Winnipeg.
Isak Chartaner and Wigdor Bernstein are not in any way connected to our
family. My grandmother and grandfather both lived together in Winnipeg
untill 1960, the year they both passed away. We have never heard of the
other 2 names.
In 1921 there were 4076 Jews in Sanok. The Langsams you speak of may be
a completely unrelated family. Or possibly, they may stem from one of the 9
brothers and sisters of my grandmother, details of them I am collecting from
my mother.

Have you visited Sanok? Do you have street addresses for the Langsams there?
That would help as my mother remembers some street addresses.
I saw your search request on the Net under Sanok in a Jewish search service.

Finally, my grandmother's parents were Pesel and Pinchas Langsam from
Tyreva'
21 km from Sanok.

Pesel and Pinchas were my great grandparents. They lived in Tereva. They 
had
10 children.$ of them lived in Winnipeg and I knew them The children
were:Scheindel, my grandmother, she died in Winnipeg in March 1960. Avrum,
Sarah, Ronia, Kalman, Chaia,and Slova who all died in the war. Then there
was Anny who died in Winnipeg around 1970, Moishe langsam , my uncle who
died in Winnipeg around 15 years ago and my aunt Clara who died in Winnipeg
about 1 month ago.
Now my mom is Ruth Zimmer whose mother was Scheindel. My mom lost a young
brother in the war. My mom's brother Saul, sisters  Ann and Sally all still
live in Winnipeg.

Clara's children are  Rosalynnwho lives in Winnipeg and Sammy Linhart who
lives in Phoenix. They both have their own kids. My Brother lives in Las
Vegas.

Moishe Langsam had no children. Anny had 2 children, both still live in
Winnipeg.

I was in Poland last year and drove through Tereva. I wasn't so interested
in this stuff then so I only really visited Sanok where my mom was born.

What is your r elationship to these folks? Please let me know. Earl Zimmer
