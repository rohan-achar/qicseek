<I><P>At the University of California, Irvine (UCI), a group of professors have agreed with the initiative of the chairman of the fibre channel clustering committee to establish a Clustering, SAN and Fibre Channel Laboratory. Housed in UCI�s Department of Information &amp; Computer Science, the Clustering, SAN and Fibre Channel Lab will be sustained through an alliance of academia and industry.</P>
<P>UCI�s Department of Information &amp; Computer Science was recently ranked by PC Week as one of our nation�s top 10 programs for technology education. It is the largest computing department in the University of California system, and the third largest of any school in the West. The faculty and students are uniquely qualified to lead new trends in clustering research. </P>

</FONT><B><P>SPONSOR BENEFITS</P>

<UL>
</B></U><I><LI>Product Testing</I> � Each industry sponsor will be provided with access to the lab for testing of product performance, interoperability and scalability. The average duration for industry usage will be 2 to 4 days. Extended industry testing arrangements may be considered by the board in accordance with university research needs. All testing will be completed by the industry sponsor and it is expected that the lab will be left in its original state for continuation of university research. Sponsors will also have the exclusive option for additional lab usage on a fee-for-service basis. Please note that UCI does not assume legal responsibility for assuring the accuracy of testing completed in the lab. </LI>
<I><LI>Advisory Board</I> � The board is comprised of lab faculty and representatives from industry, ensuring that sponsors have direct input into activities and policy decisions. The board meets on a quarterly basis. </LI>
<I><LI>Technical Reports</I> - Subscription to all technical reports published by lab faculty and the Information &amp; Computer Science Department. </LI>
<I><LI>Annual Meeting</I> � Lab faculty present research findings on an annual basis to share ideas on clustering issues. </LI>
<I><LI>Visiting Researchers </I>- Companies have the opportunity to send visiting scholars and have them participate in a faculty member's research group consistent with resource availability. </LI>
<I><LI>Recruiting</I> - Lab sponsors will have opportunities to interact with students, as well as, post job announcements in student labs and electronic bulletin boards.</LI></UL>

<B><U><P>&nbsp;</P>
