<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Overview</font></font></b>
<p><font size=-1>In this paper, we describe our effort at developing and
demonstrating a prototype knowledge-based Web environment for modeling,
diagnosing and redesigning complex business processes. Our goal was to
investigate how a modern knowledge representation system, Loom [MB95],
can favorably leverage the development and evolution of a knowledge web
that links narrative, informal and formal descriptions of on-line cases
on business process redesign. In so doing, we demonstrate concepts, techniques
and tools that facilitate the development of a <i>knowledge web management
system</i> (KWMS) in an application domain of interest to enterprises throughout
the world.</font>
<p><font size=-1>We start with a brief background discussion of commercial
approaches to knowledge management, as well as to introduce our conception
of knowledge webs and knowledge web management systems. We next describe
three problems that drive our investigation. The problems are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1>how to acquire global knowledge for how to redesign complex
business processes,</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>how to develop knowledge representation and operationalization
methods that utilize Web resources and technologies, and</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>how to facilitate the continuing evolution and improvement
of a knowledge web for business process reengineering.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=-1>In response, we present a strategy for how to address these
problems in a way that combines the capabilities of a large knowledge acquisition
team with intelligent systems technologies and the Web. This includes how
Web resources and knowledge-based systems were used, the kinds of classification
taxonomies that were developed, and how relevant domain and instance-level
knowledge was formally represented. In particular, we show how we used
Loom and its corresponding Web browser interface, Ontosaurus, in developing
a KWMS. Our results demonstrate that an evolving <i>knowledge web</i> can
be developed and supported by automated reasoning, analysis and classification
mechanisms to incrementally integrate new domain facts and to derive implied
relations. Our conclusions then follow.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Background</font></font></b>
<p><font size=-1>Knowledge management (KM) within modern or virtual enterprises
is an emerging area for research investigations, as well as for the development
and deployment of commercially available systems [O98]. Commercial systems
like Lotus Notes focus on capturing and managing unstructured information
that is created and shared by people in enterprises. This information serves
as a narrative knowledge base that is to be organized and managed. Other
systems from KM tool vendors such as Autonomy Inc. and InXight Inc. provide
computational mechanisms that process unstructured information in a Lotus
Notes text base or corporate Intranet repository. These mechanisms add
value by automatically constructing category (word phrases or co-occurrences)
hierarchies and hypertext indices/links that characterize a set of related
documents. This is possible in that these mechanisms employ term clustering
or classification techniques based on statistical, information theoretic
and linguistic analyses of a text database. By their very nature, text
analysis techniques such as these provide their value through a shallow
syntactic or surface-level processing of a document or text base. However,
this value can be enhanced through use of synonym tables, thesauri, domain
keyword vocabularies or other weak models to augment the analyses. Nonetheless,
these significant capabilities are now commercially available to enterprises
that want to begin to manage their text-based knowledge assets.</font>
<p><font size=-1>On the research front, much work in KM remains to be done
that builds on results from knowledge engineering, reasoning and problem-solving
mechanisms, and other aspects of intelligent systems. Here classic problems
in knowledge acquisition, representation and operationalization must be
addressed, as they must by commercial KM systems. As noted above, commercial
KM system can employ weak models to great success in acquiring and representing
(via hypertext links) interrelated text documents that can be operationalized
(distributed and navigated) through Web browsers and repository servers.
But there is little use of knowledge engineering, reasoning or intelligent
systems techniques in commercial KM tools. In contrast, our effort builds
from these techniques.</font>
<p><font size=-1>One of the keys to understanding the current emphasis
on unstructured information is to realize there is a wide range of levels
of formalization in the ways knowledge is represented in KM systems. At
the same time, the level of formalization or structure of the knowledge
source restricts the mechanisms available to manipulate it, provide services
and solve problems. This is presented in Figure 1.</font>

<br><b><font size=-1>Figure 1</font>. </b><font size=-1>The Knowledge dimension:
forms and mechanisms</font></center>

<p><font size=-1>Along the top is a sort of the notational forms in which
knowledge can be captured and represented. From left to right we increase
the formalization and precision of knowledge, while from right to left,
we accommodate more informality and ambiguity. Knowledge forms towards
the left end are relatively easy for people to create and update, while
knowledge forms to the right increasingly demand knowledge engineering,
incremental analysis and truth maintenance capability. Along the bottom
is a sort of representative knowledge processing tools or mechanisms. From
left to right we note an increase in the ability to derive some semantic
interpretation from an associated knowledge form: from co-occurrence of
specified keywords to logical expressions and deductive assertions. Conversely,
from right to left we increase the amount and diversity of information
we can search or browse for relevant knowledge. Clearly, most knowledge
found on the Web is towards the left end. Further, most of the KM tools
concentrate on the left half. In this study, we seek to broaden this scope
by organizing, interrelating and managing business process redesign knowledge
that <i>spans</i> this dimension.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The research in this article is focused on the domain
of "business process redesign", or BPR. BPR involves the transformation
of enterprise processes, information infrastructure, work situations and
surrounding resources into more optimal configurations. BPR is in many
ways a precursor of KM in enterprises from historical, organizational and
technological perspectives [DP98]. Though much has been written about BPR
and hundreds of BPR case studies have appeared (in print and on the Web),
there has been little effort at developing an underlying formalization
as to what constitutes BPR. For example, an initial effort classify and
retrieve relevant cases has been demonstrated using case-based reasoning
techniques on a set of eight cases represented as attribute-value tuples
[KS96]. Other notable efforts employ knowledge-based capabilities to help
redesign specific business processes [N97, ST96]. Nonetheless, there has
been progress in developing concepts, techniques and tools for formalizing
and engineering enterprise <i>processes</i> for business and software development
from a knowledge-based perspective [MS96, N97, SM97]. In addition, this
progress with enterprise process technology has also led to the integration
and use of Web technologies [SN97]. Finally, we have an existing process
modeling ontology available to us [MS96]. We thus use our existing enterprise
process ontology and domain expertise as the starting point for representing
knowledge about BPR. Subsequently, we choose to acquire and represent knowledge
of BPR from case studies found on the Web.</font>
<p><font size=-1>By combining formalized knowledge representations for
enterprise processes with Web technologies, we make a move towards the
development of intelligent support tools for managing BPR knowledge over
the Web. Our goal in this study is to acquire and represent a knowledge
web for BPR that is operationalized and managed by a prototype knowledge
web management system (KWMS). The knowledge web is the target knowledge
base we wish to acquire and represent; the environment for operationalizing
and managing this knowledge works as a KWMS.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Problems</font></font></b>
<p><font size=-1>In order to realize our research goal, we must address
three problems. The first problem is <i>how to acquire global knowledge
for how to redesign complex business processes</i>. Our solution entails
a number of activities. We start by using popular search engines and index
servers available on the Web. Using keywords such as "business process
redesign", "process reengineering" and "case studies", we quickly locate
hundreds of links to possible sources of BPR knowledge cases. Of course,
given the variability in the precision and recall of these information
retrieval services, a substantial effort is needed to browse, filter and
select BPR narratives that can subsequently be coded and classified as
useful cases. As a result, we employed a group of 30 graduate students
participating in a graduate seminar on BPR to browse, filter, select, code
and classify the 200+ BPR cases we found on the Web. The commercial KM
tool capabilities noted earlier were not available to us at the time. Thus
we could not avoid this problem. Furthermore, even if these tools were
available to us, browsing a rough sample of retrieved BPR links reveals
that some BPR narratives are short (1-2 printed pages), while others bring
up long reports or online books (100-200+ pages). Similarly, some narratives
describe <i>experience reports</i>, while others tell of <i>lessons learned</i>
or prescribe <i>best practices</i> [O98]. Subsequently, there is a great
deal of variability and uncertainty with respect to the kind of results
one gets through a surface level analysis of BPR case texts found on the
Web, depending on what cases are used for analysis and categorization,
and what order you choose to analyze them. As such, our team-based knowledge
acquisition effort could produce models of BPR knowledge that might be
inconsistent, logically incomplete, or inadequately traceable when integrated.
We therefore needed ways and means to enable the construction of a consistent,
logically complete and traceable knowledge web for BPR.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The second problem we faced was <i>how to develop knowledge
representation and operationalization methods that utilize Web resources
and technologies</i>. This problem is related to the preceding one. In
particular, our graduate student collaborators were organized into six
teams who could openly discuss and share their emerging knowledge as to
what knowledge they were finding in the Web-based BPR cases. Cases came
from all over the world, though for practical reasons, we limited our efforts
to those available in English and accessible without fee. All students
were trained for what to examine in each case, and each team was assigned
to develop a specific BPR case taxonomy. Cases were examined for information
that could minimally conform to the ontology of objects, attributes, relations
and constraints specified in the <i>process meta-model</i> [MS96]. In simple
terms, students had to identify the organizational roles of the participants
identified in the case, the information processing tasks these participants
performed within the business process, the resources used or consumed in
the tasks, any off-line or on-line tools or applications, any Internet/Web
elements, and what changes occurred to any of these as a result of the
process redesign described in the case. Beyond this, the students then
had to identify one or more process redesign heuristics that could characterize
each selected case. Open discussion and collaboration was again encouraged
in identifying the process redesign heuristics, including a lecture discussion
of one case study that identifies ten process redesign heuristics [SN97].
Overall, more than 30 process redesign heuristics were identified and classified.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Next, six taxonomies were identified for grouping and
organizing access to the BPR cases discovered on the Web. These taxonomies
classified and indexed the cases according to:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1><i>Generic type of industry process: </i>financial, manufacturing,
research and development, marketing, etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>As-is "problems" with existing process: </i>off-line information
processing, workflow delays, lack of information sharing, etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>To-be "solutions" sought for redesigned process: </i>automate
off-line information processing tasks, streamline workflow, use email and
databases to share information, etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>Use of intranet, extranet or Web-based process redesign
solutions: </i>build intranet portal for Human Resources information, use
HTML form-EDI translators for procurement from Internet-based suppliers,
etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>BPR how-to guidelines or lessons learned: </i>explicit
methods or steps for how to understand and model the as-is process, identify
process redesign alternatives, involve process users in selecting redesign
alternatives, etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>BPR heuristics: </i>parallelize sequence of mutually exclusive
tasks, unfold multi-stage review/approval loops, disintermediate or flatten
internal management structures, require and verify all data before processing,
etc.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=-1>In turn, each of these taxonomies could then be represented
as hierarchically nested indices of Web links to the corresponding cases
in ways familiar to Web users. Typically, each taxonomy indexes 60-120
cases out of the total set of more than 200. This means that some cases
could appear in one taxonomy but not another, while other cases might appear
in more than one, and still others might not appear in any of these taxonomies
if they were judged to not possess the minimal information needed for characterization
and modeling.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The last problem we addressed was <i>how to facilitate
the continuing evolution and improvement of a knowledge web for BPR</i>.
Proposing technically elegant solutions to the preceding two problems that
would be costly, take a long time, or produce inconsistent results would
defeat our purpose. Similarly, we cannot expect that a no-cost effort requiring
little time will produce dramatic results, at least not in a research study.
Nonetheless, we wanted to find a means that could incorporate and integrate
knowledge acquired from new BPR cases that might later be posted on the
Web in a streamlined, evolutionary and incremental manner.</font>
<p><font size=-1>With these problems at hand, we now describe our approach
to solving them using a formal knowledge system.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Approach</font></font></b>
<p><font size=-1>A key factor in achieving the goals describe in the previous
section is the ability to handle knowledge in the more formal end of the
spectrum shown in Figure 1. Representing knowledge about a business process
using an informal process model, graphic diagram, or in textual form is
not always adequate. If we want to automate reasoning with the model to
perform some task, we need to use a richer and more structured representation.
There are a variety of languages and formalisms where we can represent
a business process model. For example, we find business process models
expressed using a markup language like XML or even HTML. This provides
enough structure to build simple applications that can browse, summarize
or search the model contents. However, for complex tasks like evaluating,
diagnosing or simulating a process model, however, we may need to perform
truly automated reasoning, and for that we need a formal knowledge representation
language [SM97].</font>
<p><font size=-1>One of the reasons why formal knowledge representations
are not used more frequently is that developing a formalized knowledge
base is generally not a casual undertaking. Instead, it is one where circumstances
motivate the use or reliance on formal models of domain knowledge and problem
solving expertise. In a domain such as Air Campaign Planning [VRMS99],
the inherently complexity of the task at hand together with the multiplicity
of system applications users employ underscores the need to invest in a
developing a formalized knowledge based. Similarly, in a domain like BPR,
there is widespread opportunity to practice and reuse known concepts, techniques
and tools to realize economic gain, organizational transformation or reinvention.
This justifies the investment in developing and engineering a formal knowledge
base for BPR interlinked to supporting cases and navigational indices on
the Web.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In particular, this points to the need to develop knowledge
bases that can be reused easily. Thus, our approach consisted of developing
a generic, reusable knowledge base or <i>ontology</i> [VRMS99] of business
processes and then using it for creating specific knowledge bases of processes
in a given industry or company. In turn, the reusable part of these some
of these knowledge bases can be transformed into reusable ontologies, in
a layered approach.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Once we have the knowledge of business processes formalized
in a knowledge representation system we can use the reasoning mechanisms
provided by that system to develop applications that analyze a specific
process model. In order to test these ideas, we used the ontology of business
processes to build a tool to diagnose business process models. The tool
reasons with a given process model using a classification mechanisms and
lists the problems found. Its knowledge base contains a description of
a taxonomy of types of problems in business process models. We then tested
this tool by applying it to model cost accounting business processes in
a large utility company in California.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">Tools for handling formal knowledge</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>In developing knowledge bases and ontologies for the domain
of BPR we used two tools. First, in order to represent BPR knowledge formally
and reason with it, we selected the Loom knowledge representation system
[MB95]. Loom is a language and environment for constructing ontologies
and intelligent applications [VRMS99]. It has been distributed to more
than 80 universities and corporations, and is being used in numerous DARPA-sponsored
projects in planning, software engineering and intelligent integration
of information. Declarative knowledge in Loom consists of <i>definitions</i>
of concept, relations and instances. A deductive engine called a <i>classifier</i>
utilizes forward-chaining, semantic unification and object-oriented truth
maintenance technologies in order to compile the declarative knowledge
into a network designed to efficiently support on-line deductive query
processing. By using Loom to re-implement the process meta-model ontology,
we can construct formal models of business processes, classification taxonomies
and process redesign heuristics. In turn, we can then analyze, query, browse
and identify relevant redesign alternatives for processes that have been
modeled in Loom and linked over the Web. Finally, we can take advantage
of Loom's deductive classifier so that as new BPR cases are acquired, taxonomically
classified and formally modeled, our knowledge web can evolve with automated
support.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Second, in order to support the visualization of the knowledge
bases constructed, we used Ontosaurus [ONTO], a Web browser interface to
the Loom system. Ontosaurus is a client-server tool in which a server (written
in CommonLisp) with Loom and one or more knowledge bases loaded replies
to queries and produces Web pages describing several aspects of the knowledge
base. It is also able to provide simple facilities for producing general
queries and editing the contents of knowledge bases. Figure 2 shows a typical
browser window accessing Ontosaurus. The display consists of three window
panels; Toolbar (top), Reference (left side) and Content (right side).
The Toolbar panel consists of buttons to perform various operations such
as <i>select domain theory</i>, <i>display theory, save updates</i>, etc.
The Reference and Content panels are designed to display contents of a
selected ontology. Links in both panels display their contents in the Content
window. This facilitates exploring various links associated with a word
or concept in the Reference window without the need to continuously go
back and forth. The bookmark window holds user-selected links for Web pages
to Ontosaurus pages, and is managed by the buttons in the bottom of the
bookmark window.</font>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Formally Representing Business Process Models
and Process Redesign</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>We now describe how we built a knowledge-based system
to represent and diagnose models of BPR. The system is based on an ontology
of business processes expressed in Loom. Loom provides a semantic network
knowledge representation framework based on description logics. In Loom
it is possible to define <i>concepts</i> that have roles or slots to specify
its attributes. A key feature of description logic representations is that
the semantics of the representation language are very precisely specified.
This precise specification makes it possible for the classifier to determine
whether one concept <i>subsumes</i> another based solely on the formal
definitions of the two concepts. The classifier is an important tool for
evolving ontologies because it can be used to automatically organize a
set of Loom concepts into a classification hierarchy or taxonomy based
solely on their definitions. This capability is particularly important
as the ontology becomes large, since the classifier will find subsumption
relations that people might overlook, as well as modeling errors that could
make the knowledge base inconsistent.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Modeling Business Process Knowledge
in Loom</font></font></i>
<p><font size=-1>The specific process ontology (or meta-model) we employed
is centered on the notion of resource [MS96]. There are three basic types
of resource: process, agent and simple resource (which is a placeholder
for all non-agent resources that are not processes). In order to facilitate
communication with a user community that is accustomed to object-oriented
modeling, we chose a modeling style in Loom that is closest to object-orientation.
For example, information about concepts is stored into roles, similarly
to classes and properties in an object-oriented language. The definition
of the concept </font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>process</font></font><font size=-1>
appears in the left frame of Figure 3.</font>
<p><font size=-1>We also made use of Loom?s superior expressiveness. For
instance, in Loom, roles, slots or properties are first-class objects called
<i>relations.</i>
Relations are defined separately, and may contain not only type restrictions
but also cardinality restrictions. It also allows the definition of inverse
relations, such as in the example below, where we define the relation </font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>intelligence-collective-role-own-resource</font></font><font size=-1>.
Note also how we define the domain of the relation as a logical composition
over some existing concepts (types).</font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(defrelation intelligence-collective-role-own-resource</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>:domain (:or intelligent-agent
process-role collective-agent)</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>:range resource</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>:inverse resource-belong-to-intelligence-collective-role)</font></font>
<p><font size=-1>To create a business process model entails creating a
number of instances of the available concepts. This is done in a manner
similar to how objects that are instances of classes are created in object-oriented
languages. Instances are created in Loom with the command tellm. For example,
the following is the definition of a business process in a company where
we applied the system to support process modeling, analysis and redesign.
The definition specifies, for example, that the instance </font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>Produce-work-order</font></font><font size=-1>
has the attribute </font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>process-require-resource</font></font><font size=-1>
filled by the value </font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>work-order-preparation-info</font></font><font size=-1>
(which is itself an instance defined elsewhere).</font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(tellm (:about Produce-work-order</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>process</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(process-require-resource work-order-preparation-info)</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(process-require-resource work-order-data)</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(process-provide-resource work-order)</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(process-assigned-to-agent-role
business-unit)</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(process-require-tool-resource
accounting-computer-system)))</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Modeling Types of Problems in a
Business Process Model</font></font></i>
<p><font size=-1>We used the taxonomy of problems in business processes
models described above and elsewhere [MS97]. There are three types of problems
that arise when modeling business processes. First, consistency problems
refer to conflicts in the specification of several properties of a given
process. For example, a typical consistency problem is to have a process
with the same name as one of its outputs (something that occurs surprisingly
often in practice, perhaps because the output is often the most visible
characteristic of a process). Second, completeness problems cover incomplete
specifications of the process. For instance, a typical completeness problem
occurs when we specify a process with no inputs (a "miracle", which can
produce outputs with no inputs) or no outputs (a "black hole", where inputs
disappear without generating any output). Third, traceability problems
are caused by incorrect specification of the origin of the model itself:
its author and responsible. Subsequently, a process model that is consistent,
complete and traceable can be said to be internally correct.</font>
<p><font size=-1>One of the main reasons that we selected Loom as a representation
language was its capability to represent easily and naturally abstract
patterns of data that are the very definition of the problems we discussed
above. This capability is very handy to produce simple and readable representations
of the types of problems with process models. For example, we can define
a </font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>black-hole</font></font><font size=-1>
in plain English as "a process with no outputs". This can be easily described
in Loom as a process that provides exactly zero resources:</font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(defconcept black-hole</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>:is (:and process</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(:exactly 0 process-provide-resource)))</font></font>

with</font><b> </b><font size=-1><font face="Courier New">Process </font>concept
definition loaded in the Reference window and a process redesign instance
in the Contents window</font></center>

<p><font size=-1>Many of the simple types of problems can be specified
similarly. A more interesting example is the definition of a process with
the same name as one of its inputs. Here we use logical expressions to
describe conditions that an instance must satisfy in order for a concept
to apply. For instance, below we show the specification of <font face="Courier New">process-and-input-with-same-name</font>
in the ontology. The definition reads (roughly) that a process has input
with the same name if and only if it is a process and it satisfies the
condition that it requires itself.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>(defconcept process-and-input-with-same-name</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>&nbsp;:is (:and process</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-2>&nbsp;(:satisfies ?x (process-require-resource
?x ?x))))</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">The diagnosis tool</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>Using the representations discussed above, we built a
system that diagnoses business processes. The system operation is very
straightforward. The user describes a process model through Ontosaurus
for processing by Loom as discussed above. Then the system diagnoses the
model provided. One of the advantages of using Loom is that once we define
an instance, Loom immediately (and automatically) applies its reasoning
engine (the classifier) to find out what concepts apply to that instance.
This offers a big advantage, since there is no need to specify an algorithm
for the diagnosis process: the diagnosis occurs automatically as we define
the model. In addition, the classifier performs truth-maintenance: if we
redefine a process to correct a problem found by the system, the classifier
will immediately retract the assertion that the problem applies to that
process. Thus, we do not need to keep track of the state of the diagnosis
as the model changes; instead, the classifier handles the processing activities.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In order to provide a more direct interface to the diagnosis
system, we extended the Ontosaurus browser to display two new types of
pages. The first displays a description of process in a less Loom-specific
way (e.g., for reporting purposes). The second displays a list of all problems
found in the current process model we input.. The extension was rather
simple: all we had to do was to design two additional output page templates
and code the appropriate responses in the Loom server. Figure 4 shows a
screenshot of the Web page constructed by the server to describe the problems
found in a model of a cost accounting process (see below).</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Testing the system</font></font></i>
<p><font size=-1>We tested the system with a team assigned the task of
redesigning the cost accounting processes of a utility company in California
(the name is omitted for confidentiality reasons). The team had to acquire
knowledge of the processes, formally represent them, and then eventually
propose a to-be solution that redesigned the processes. The team interviewed
process experts, met with several employees, examined documentation, organizational
charts, etc. The first value-added provided by the KWMS was caused even
before using the process diagnosis module. By modeling the process in more
or less formal terms (i.e. using the process ontology embedded in the system),
the team was able to construct a more coherent model. The KWMS helped the
BPR team to be more precise and detailed than when they just used graphic
diagrams and narrative text. The second value-added was provided by the
diagnosis system, since it helped catch errors early in the modeling process.
An example appears in Figure 4. In fact, in the beginning the diagnosis
module helped the team to learn how to construct the formal representation
of the process model by providing feedback in what they should not do.
The number of errors generated by entering new processes steadily diminished
with time, showing the value of the system.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Discussion and Conclusions</font></font></b>
<p><font size=-1>Our investigation demonstrated and prototyped approach
to integrate knowledge management and business process reengineering with
global resources accessible over the Web. A knowledge web for BPR was acquired,
represented and operationalized by a team of collaborating graduate students.
We prototyped a Loom-based knowledge web management system that supported
the development, use and incremental evolution of a knowledge web grounded
in informal BPR case studies found on the Web. This KWMS provides the capability
to browse, query, model, and diagnose a knowledge base of formal models
of business processes, multiple BPR classification taxonomies, and process
redesign heuristics. Subsequently, our team learned and practiced Web-based
knowledge management and BPR through participation and contribution. However,
the KWMS at this stage lacks the capability to automatically redesign formalized
business processes.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Automated redesign is a problem-solving task that represents
the next stage of development of our prototype. However, there are BPR
situations where automated redesign may not be a suitable goal or outcome.
This is in organizational settings where people seek empowerment and involvement
in designing and controlling their process structures and workflow. In
settings such as these, the ability to access, search/query, select and
evaluate possible process redesign alternatives through a KWMS may be more
desirable [cf. SN97]. Thus the ultimate purpose of the KWMS we describe
may be in <i>supporting</i> <i>and empowering</i> BPR participants rather
than in automating BPR.</font>

<p><font size=-1>Overall, the problems identified and addressed by this
research are generic and independent of specific business process types.
Nonetheless, we believe the approach we pursued is highly reusable and
can for the most part be replicated in other settings. Subsequently, we
find there are classes of research and practical problems whose solution
may span a knowledge dimension that covers informal, semi-structured, and
formal representations of knowledge that must then be interlinked across
the Web and formal knowledge systems. This work thus represents one such
solution.</font>
