<h1>
Fast Algorithms for Minimum Weight Constant Length Cycles in Edge-Weighted Graphs
</h1>

<h2>presented by Mike Nelson</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
I will present some results from "Finding the Smallest 
H-Subgraph in Real Weighted Graphs and Related Problems", by Virginia 
Vassilevska, Ryan Williams, and Raphael Yuster.
This work appeared in the International Colloquium on Autotmata,
Languages and Programming 2006.
I will present their deterministic algorithm for 
finding the minimum weight cycle of length <I>k</I>.
For a fixed (constant) <I>k</I>, the algorithm has running time
that is sub-quadratic in <I>m</I>, the number of edges.
