<H2>Setting the Environment Variables in Windows NT</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
This section will explain how to set the proper environment variables on
Windows NT.  

</p>

<H3>Environment Variables in Windows NT</H3>

<p>&nbsp; Environment variables provide information to applications.  
Windows NT places user defined environment variables in the
system section of the control panel.  
</p>

<H3>Setting the Proper Environment Variables</H3>

<p>&nbsp;
There are three environment variables that need to be set in order for 
you to have the modules in place that Chimera uses.  They are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> JAVA_HOME (which contains the path to the latest JDK which should be 
	at least JDK 1.1.5)
    <li> SWING_HOME (which contains the path to swing 0.7)
    <li> CLASSPATH (which should contain the path to the downloaded packages)
	<ul>
	    <li> JSDK 1.0.1
	    <li> HTTPClient 0.3
	    <li> Rivendell 0.6 
	    <li> MSXML 1.8
	</ul>
</ul>

<p> To check whether you have these variables set properly, follow these
steps to the location of the environment variables:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Open the Control Panel.
	<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_settings.gif" WIDTH="286"
	HEIGHT="198"></CENTER>

    <li> Double click the System icon from the Control Panel window.
	<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_control_panel.gif" WIDTH="475"
	HEIGHT="394"></CENTER>
	The System Properties window will appear.

    <li> Click on the Environment tab.  This will display the 
	information about the environment variables used. 
	<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_environment.gif" WIDTH="408"
	HEIGHT="465"></CENTER>
	If you need to change the values, use the Variable and Value
	fields at the bottom of the window to set the values you wish.
</ol>

<p> Note: In this screenshot, SWING_HOME and JAVA_HOME are properly set,
and the path to the chimera byte-code is set in CLASSPATH (chimera.zip
was a testing version of chimera used by the tester).
</p>

<p> You should set the Environment Variables to include the proper 
paths to packages Chimera 2.0 needs on your system. (See the sections
on setting the various packages to the CLASSPATH on Solaris for 
examples with show what the path set-ups were like.)
