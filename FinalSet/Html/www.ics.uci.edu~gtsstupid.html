Some of my favorite moronic expressions polluting modern-day (American) English:
<ul style="font-family: arial;">
<font size="-1">


<li> <b> Disenfranchised minority </b> -- a tragedy in three acts:
<ol> <li> once, there was a minority, 
<li> it was then happily <b>en</b>-franchised, and then, 
<li> some (evil) force <b>dis</b>-en-franchised it
</ol>

<li> <b> Innocent women and children </b>  -- either/or: 
<ol> <li> men are guilty, one way or another, or 
<li> there are some women and children who are not innocent
</ol>

<li> <b> Vicious assault </b> --  there must be soft, considerate and gentle ways to assault someone

<li> <b> Brutal murder </b> -- somewhere, someplace murders are comfy, cozy and pleasant

<li> <b> Aid and abet  / rot and decay / cease and desist / lewd and lascivious </b> -- redundancy never, ever, ever, ever, ever hurts in aiding comprehension, right?

<li> <b> Mean-spirited attack </b> -- when attacking someone, please strive to do so in a kind-hearted and well-meaning manner

<li> <b> Hard-working </b> people/immigrants/etc. -- as opposed to lazy and slovenly (people/immigrants/etc.)

<li> Country/nation/ethnic-group <b> with a long and rich history </b> -- in contrast to those 
others with short, lousy and poor history

<li> <b> Civilian population </b> -- some populations must be purely military

<li> <b> Intelligent design </b> -- a mythical alternative to totally stupid, brainless design 

<li> <b> Saggy and droopy </b> -- whatever this phrase refers to is usually sad enough, so why rub it in redundantly? 

<li> <b> Proud </b> nation/country/people/ethnic/group -- better than those who are ashamed of themselves and generally depressed about being what they are

<li> <b> What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger </b> -- an idiotic adage that holds particularly well with people
in a coma as well as para- and quadra-plegics.

<li> <b> An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind </b> -- a moronic proverb (attributed to Gandhi) that 
can be interpreted as: <b> No eye for an eye leaves only criminals sighted</b>.

<li> <b> Hate Crime </b> -- a real linguistic gem that refers to any crime committed while 
bearing ill will towards the victim(s). Makes one wonder why similarly appealing concepts
of "Love Crime", "Adulation Crime", "Contempt Crime" or "Diss Crime" are not being popularized.

</ul>
