      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
            This document describes the use of TIFF (Tag Image File Format) to
            represent the data content and structure generated by the current
            suite of ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 facsimile. These
            Recommendations and the TIFF fields described here support the
            following facsimile modes or profiles:
         
      </p><pre>
      S:  minimal black-and-white mode, using binary MH compression
             [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>]
      F:  extended black-and-white mode, using binary MH, MR and MMR
             compression [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>, <a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.6, Facsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for group 4 facsimile apparatus, November 1988" href="chapter11.html#T.6">T.6</a>]
      J:  lossless JBIG black-and-white mode, with JBIG compression
             [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.85, Application profile for Recommendation T.82 - Progressive bi-level image compression (JBIG coding scheme) for facsimile apparatus, August 1995" href="chapter11.html#T.85">T.85</a>, <a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.82, Information technology - Coded representation of picture and audio information - Progressive bi- level image compression, March 1995" href="chapter11.html#T.82">T.82</a>]
      C:  lossy color and grayscale mode, using JPEG compression
             [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.42, Continuous-tone colour representation method for facsimile, February 1996" href="chapter11.html#T.42">T.42</a>, <a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.81, Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images - Requirements and guidelines, September 1992" href="chapter11.html#T.81">T.81</a>]
      L:  lossless color and grayscale mode, using JBIG compression
             [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.43, Colour and gray-scale image representations using lossless coding scheme for facsimile, February 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.43">T.43</a>, <a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.82, Information technology - Coded representation of picture and audio information - Progressive bi- level image compression, March 1995" href="chapter11.html#T.82">T.82</a>]
      M:  mixed raster content mode [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997." href="chapter11.html#T.44">T.44</a>], using a combination of
             existing compression methods
</pre><p>
            Each profile corresponds to the content of ITU-T Recommendations
            shown and is a subset of the full TIFF for facsimile specification.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Profile S describes a minimal interchange set of fields, which will
            guarantee that, at least, binary black-and-white images will be
            supported. Implementations are required to support this minimal
            interchange set of fields.

      <p>
            With the intent of specifying a file format for Internet Fax, this
            draft:
         
      </p>
      <ol>
               
         <li>  specifies the structure of TIFF files for facsimile data,</li>
                
         <li> defines ITU fax-compatible values for existing TIFF fields,</li>
                
         <li> defines new TIFF fields and values required for compatibility
                       with ITU color fax.
         </li>
         
      </ol>
      <p>
            This specification of TIFF for facsimile is known as TIFF-FX.
         
      </p><a name="sub1"></a><h3>1.1. Scope</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            This document defines a TIFF-based file format specification for
            enabling standardized messaging-based fax over the Internet. It
            specifies the TIFF fields and field values required for compatibility
            with the existing ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white,
            grayscale and color facsimile. TIFF has historically been used for
            handling fax image files in applications such as store-and-forward
            messaging.  Implementations that support this file format
            specification for import/export may elect to support it as a native
            format. This document recommends a TIFF file structure that is
            compatible with low-memory and page-level streaming implementations.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Unless otherwise noted, the current TIFF specification [<a title="Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1" href="chapter11.html#TIFF">TIFF</a>] and
            selected TIFF Technical Notes [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>, <a title="Draft TIFF Technical Note 2, Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification, March 17, 1995, ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TTN2.draft.txt" href="chapter11.html#TTN2">TTN2</a>] are the primary references
            for describing TIFF and defining TIFF fields. This document is the
            primary reference for defining TIFF field values for fax
            applications.
         
      </p>
      <a name="sub2"></a><h3>1.2. Approach</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            The basic approach to using TIFF for facsimile data is to insert the
            compressed fax image data in a TIFF file and use TIFF fields to
            encode the parameters that describe the image data. These fields will
            have values that comply with the ITU-T Recommendations. The MIME
            content type of the resulting file will be image/tiff, with an
            optional Application parameter [<a title="Parsons, G., Rafferty J. and S. Zilles, &#34;Tag Image File Format (TIFF) - image/tiff MIME Sub-type Registration&#34;, RFC 2302, March 1998." href="chapter11.html#TIFF-REG">TIFF-REG</a>]; see Section 9.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            This approach takes advantage of TIFF features and structures that
            bridge the data formats and performance requirements of both legacy
            fax machines and host-based fax applications. TIFF constructs for
            pages, images, and strips allow a TIFF file to preserve the fax data
            stream structure and the performance advantages that come with it. A
            TIFF-based approach also builds on an established base of users and
            implementors and ensures backward compatibility with existing TIFF-
            based IETF proposals and work in progress for Internet fax.
         
      </p>
      <a name="sub3"></a><h3>1.3. Overview of this draft</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            Section 2 gives an overview of TIFF. Section 2.1 describes the
            structure of TIFF files, including general guidelines for structuring
            multi-page TIFF files. Section 2.2 lists the TIFF fields that are
            required or recommended for all fax modes. The TIFF fields used only
            by specific fax modes are described in Sections 3-8, which describe
            the individual fax modes. These sections also specify the ITU-
            compatible field values (image parameters) for each mode.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            The full set of permitted fields of TIFF for facsimile are included
            in the current TIFF specification, Section 2 of this document and the
            sections on specific modes of facsimile operation. This document
            defines profiles of TIFF for facsimile, where a profile is a subset
            of the full set of permitted fields and field values of TIFF for
            facsimile.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Section 3 defines the minimal black-and-white facsimile mode (Profile
            S), which is required in all implementations. Section 4 defines the
            extended black-and-white fax mode (Profile F), which provides a
            standard definition of TIFF-F. Section 5 describes the lossless
            black-and-white mode using JBIG compression (Profile J). Section 6
            defines the base color mode, required in all color implementations,
            for the lossy JPEG representation of color and grayscale facsimile
            data (Profile C). Section 7 defines the lossless JBIG color and
            grayscale facsimile mode (Profile L) and Section 8 defines the Mixed
            Raster Content facsimile mode (Profile M). Each of these sections
            concludes with a table summarizing the required and recommended
            fields for each mode and the values they can have.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Section 9 describes the MIME content type image/tiff and the use of
            the optional Application parameter in connection with TIFF for
            facsimile. Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 give Security Considerations,
            the ISOC Copyright Notice, References and Authors' Addresses. Annex A
            gives a summary of the TIFF fields used or defined in this document
            and provides a convenient reference for implementors.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            To implement only the minimal interchange black-and-white set of
            fields and values (Profile S), one need read only Sections 1, 2, 3, 9
            and 10.

            The following tree diagram shows the relationship among profiles and
            between profiles and coding methods.

                                       L (JBIG)   \
                                                   \
                                                    M (MRC)
</pre>
      <p>
            A profile is based on a collection of ITU-T facsimile coding methods.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            For example, Profile S, the minimal mode, is based on Modified
            Huffman (MH) compression, which are defined in ITU-T Rec. T.4.
            Profile F specifies Modified Read (MR) and Modified Modified Read
            (MMR) compressions, which are defined in ITU-T Rec. T.4 and T.6.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            All implementations of TIFF for facsimile MUST implement Profile S,
            which is the root node of the tree. All color implementations of TIFF
            for facsimile MUST implement Profile C. The implementation of a
            particular profile MUST also implement those profiles on the path
            that connect it to the root node, and MAY optionally implement
            profiles not on the path connecting it to the root node. For example,
            an implementation of Profile M must also implement Profiles C and S,
            and may optionally implement Profile F, J or L. For another example,
            an implementation of Profile C must also implement Profile S, and may
            optionally implement Profile F or J.
