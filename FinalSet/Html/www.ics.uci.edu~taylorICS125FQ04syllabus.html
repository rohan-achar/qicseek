Special emphasis on the need for and use of teamwork, carefulplanning, and other techniques for working with large systems.  </blockquote><p>This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creatingsoftware systems based on the principles discussed in ICS 121: well-understoodrequirements, usability and user interface design, architectural designand module specification, well-planned testing, effective oral and writtencommunication of concepts, proper programming style, group coordination,product documentation and software process.<p>Attendance at all lectures is mandatory. In general, there will not be much  lecturing in the class. Instead, classtime will be highly interactive, and all students are expected to participate.<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>  <p>ICS 51 with a grade of C or better;  ICS 121 and 141;Mathematics 2A-B and 67. </p><p>Editorial note: What 2A-B and 67 have to do with this class is beyond me!</p><h3>  Is the Discussion Section required? </h3><p>Yes!  The discussion section is essential for two reasons:<ol><li>  You will need to meet with your teammates REGULARLY.  The best correlation  with failure that I've seen in this class over the past decade has been teams  which were unable or unwillingto establish a regular meeting schedule and to keep to it.  In other words, EVERYONE  needs to be  in attendance at team meetings. The discussion section time period  is the guaranteed time periodfor your team to meet.</li><li>Since this is a large class and  each team will be making  presentations  during the quarter, we'll have to use some of the discussion sections for those  presentations.</li></ol><h3>  What will the projects be? </h3><p>Candidate projects can come from many places:  in prior years some ICS 125teams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested.Other teams worked on projects related to on-going research programs inthe ICS department.  Other projects may come from the students.Choice of projects is related to many goals.One key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size.  It must be bigenough to challenge a team of four students, but not so big as tocommandeer everyone's life!  As a result we will spend some time at thebeginning of the fall attempting to size various projects.  Theseplanning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses.Another goal is to select a variety of projects for the class.   Sinceeach team will be making regular project presentations to the rest ofthe class, diversity of projects will enable students to learn fromexperiences across a range of project topics.Still another goal is to work on something fun and interesting!  I'vehad students working on flight simulators, generating HTML pages,linking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts, andbuilding graphical program editors. <a href="ProjectOpportunities.html">Hereare this quarter's opportunities</a>.<h3>  How will teams be composed? </h3>Each team will have 4 or 5 people.  I will attempt to balance a team'saggregate expertise with the needs of a particular project.  Iwill also attempt to accommodate some personal preferences for teammates.The <a href="survey.html">course survey form</a>, whichyou will turn in on the first day of class, isa key instrument in assigning the teams.In the end however, I make all the assignments, both of team composition andof project.<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3><p>Since ICS 125 has a strong team project orientation, it is essentialthat the drop/add process be terminated early.  Therefore <em> <font size="+1">NO dropsor adds </font></em><font size="+1"> of ICS 125 will be permitted after the end of the <strong>FIRST</strong>week of class.</font><hr><h1> Lecture Topics </h1><p>ICS 125 is on a tight time schedule, thus there is not much time for review.You are expected to recall the material covered in ICS 121 and the otherprerequisite courses.Short supplementary lectures may be given on:<ul>	<li> Teamwork and team organizations	<li> Project management	<li> Project cost and schedule estimation	<li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping	<li> Software architectural choice	<li> Configuration management and version control	<li> Distributed software engineering	<li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology</ul>Specific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projectschosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, areconcerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols andWeb technologies will be included.  <HR><a name="textbooks"></a><H1> Textbooks </H1><p>Remember reading<em> The Mythical Man-Month</em>? If you do, you can expect to profit from thatexperience in this class. If you don't, you need to read it, cover to cover BEFOREthe class begins. Don't worry, it is a quick and fun read..Dependingontheprojectschosenadditionalreadings from various sources may be required.<ul><li> REQUIRED (from earlier classes):  <ul><li>Author:              Fred Brooks<li>Title:               The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition<p>    Note that this book has a lot of white space and blank pages, so it     really will not take you long to read these chapters.</ul><li>BACKGROUND/GENERAL REFERENCES:</li><ul><li>Stephen Schach. <i>Classical and Object-Oriented Software Engineering</i>(Third Edition).

It will account for <strong>approximately</strong> 80% of yourgrade; this is broken down between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations.The<strong>approximately</strong> remaining 20% will be divided among individualcourse logs, teamwork,individual leadership demonstrated, and the final.These are guidelines intended to help students plan their work in this course.However, the instructor does reserve the<br>right to make changes in these evaluation criteria.A critcal aspect of success,however,and thus of assessment, is an effectively functioning team. Just because a team'scode &quot;works&quot; at the end of the quarter does not mean that they haveearned an A. If the team did a poor job on the requirements and design, for instance,their grade would be lower, despite &quot;working&quot; code. Put another way, if yourteam has to pull an all-nighter to get a working system, in all likelihoodyou will not receive the grade you want. <h2>Deliverables</h2>The ICS 125 project nominally consists of five major assignments. Therelative weighting of each deliverable, intended to provide you with some guidanceas to how much effort should be devoted to these tasks, and how much importance I ascribe to them, is indicated in the table below alongwiththeduedate, or approximate due date. The on-line versions of the assignments may stillbeunderconstruction(watchthe&quot;what'snew&quot;section to see when they are available).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<center><table BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 ><tr ALIGN=LEFT><td><b>Deliverable/Schedule Item</b></td><td><b>Weight&nbsp;</b></td><td bgcolor="#FFFF00"><b>Description NOTE: the URLs below are currently to the assignments from    PREVIOUS quarters and are hence subject to revision. </b></td><td><b>Due Date (subject to change) </b></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Individual Web Page</div></td><td>.</td><td>For an example see <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Emdiallo/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mdiallo/</a> or  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eshendric/">Scott Hendrickson</a></td><td> October 1st </td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Teams Designated    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>.</td><td> September 30th </td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Projects Selected/Assigned    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>.</td><td> September 30th (tentative) </td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Team Web Page</div></td><td>.</td><td>For an example </td><td> October 7th</td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Prospectus and Plan&nbsp;</div></td><td><center>10&nbsp;</center></td><td><a href="prospectus.html">Prospectus&nbsp;</a></td><td> October 8th</td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Prospectus Reviews    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>week 3</td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Requirements Specification</div></td><td><center>15&nbsp;</center></td><td><a href="requirements.html">Requirements</a></td><td> October 19 </td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Requirements Reviews    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>week 4</td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Architecture/Module Specifications&nbsp;</div></td><td><center>20&nbsp;</center></td><td><a href="design.html">Architecture/Design</a></td><td> November 2 </td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Design Reviews    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>Starting on 11/3</td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Implementation&nbsp;</div></td><td><center>20&nbsp;</center></td><td><a href="implementation.html">Implementation/1st demonstration </a></td><td> November 22</td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Code Reviews/Demos    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>week 9</td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Testing/Test Documentation</div></td><td>  <div align="center">15&nbsp;</div></td><td><a href="integration-test.html">Implementation/2nd demonstration/Quality    Assurance Report </a></td><td> December 2 </td></tr><tr><td>  <div align="left">    <ul>      Demonstrations    </ul>  </div></td><td>.</td><td>week 10 + finals week (TBD) </td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr></table></center><p> Variations on this schedule maybe made to accommodate the particular needs of a given project or a giventeam. Also, note that a team's grade for a phase is a function not only of the    document/specification developed but alsoof any associated  test plan  and any reviews   conducted inclass, with the instructor, or with the customer.<p>Have questions about your intellectual property rights (IPR)? Take a look  at the <a href="http://www.rgs.uci.edu/uirt/fhchiv.htm#B.%20%20Intellectual">UC'sview of the subject</a>.<h3>Deliverable Due Dates</h3><p>Specific due dates/times will be indicated for each assignment.NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.Since you are working in this classas part of team, it is the <strong>team's</strong> responsibility to ensure thatassignments are turned in on time. Normal excuses for late assignments, suchasillness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on theteam is ill  :-)<h3>Deliverable Reviews</h3>Each deliverable will be reviewed, some reviews will be conducted before thewhole class.<p>Your customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements reviewas well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and codereviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review isyour team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas fromall relevant parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by coursestaff and clients as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review isformal, however, and each team should have presented and negotiatedboth relevant documents to the customer prior to the review (if you haven't,it may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time).<h3> Document Requirements</h3><P>All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integralparts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-dateexistence is necessary for successful system development.<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.  They mustreside permanently on your team's website, or alternatively, in a subversionrepository (details to be announced).<P>All deliverable documents, with the exception of performance appraisals as discussed  below, must be prepared on-line and be available as part of your project home  page either as either  HTML or  .pdf  files.  NO MS  Word  files.  In general, the following should be observed.<DL>  <dl>    <dt><strong>Cover "page".</strong></dt>  </dl>  <dd> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving:  </dd></dl><DL>  <DL>    <DT><DD> Project title    <DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable    <DT><DD> Date    <DT><DD> Team name/number    <DT><DD> Team members    <DT><DD> Phase manager    <DT><DD> Phase clerical person    <DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)  </DL>  <br>  <dl>    <DT>      <strong>Table of Contents.      </strong>    <DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents    <DT><strong>Specification</strong>.    <DD> The system specification (requirements, design,    module specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and    content to the outline provided for that phase.    Sections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked    ``N/A''.    <DT><strong>Agendas and Minutes.    </strong>    <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by agendas for and minutes of    team meetings held during the associated period of time. In contrast to previous      years much more &quot;grade weight&quot; will be assigned to this part of your      deliverables. Details on this will be given in class.     <DT><strong>Performance Appraisals</strong>.    <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied    by <a href="Perf_Appraisal.doc">performance appraisals</a>.  Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained    as part of the project's web page.      <DT><strong>Project WebPage</strong>.    <DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,  shall be maintained    in a project homepage.    </DL></dl><h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3><P>For all deliverables, except for the last and except for the &quot;Agendas and Minutes&quot;  section, you will also have the opportunity to ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable  has been graded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initialversion.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how touse the techniques and so that you do not implement something from abad design or specification.  You should keep thesame responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign newresponsibilities for the next phase.<H3> Course Log</H3><P>During your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your timeeither for you employer or to improve your own productivity.Throughout this course, you will practice doing this by keeping acourse log recording the time you spend on all activities related tothis course.  At the beginning of each week you must submit the previous week's  log to the TA. A sheet showing what should be on the log <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Etaylor/ics125_fq99//logform.html">isavailable</a>.<p>Keep a copy of your logs:  you will need them at the end of the quarter for the finalreview.  <P>Each entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,and text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.</UL><p>Most entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you shouldreflect and think about what is going on.The time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records theamount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter hour.<P>You will be marked down only for failing to submit logs each week,giving too little detail, or failing to keep track of time spent.  <P>You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errorsyou make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recordingthese errors is so that you develop a better understanding of thekinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding youcan improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attentionto those areas in which you've had problems in the past.<h2><font color="#990000">Summary of what you turn in, and when:</font></h2><ol>  <li><font color="#990000">Weekly, by individual, using a dropbox: course log      for preceding week.</font></li>  <li><font color="#990000">Per deliverable, by team, on website: deliverable documents.</font></li>  <li><font color="#990000">Per deliverable, by team, on paper, performance appraisals.

This is particularly true whenyou don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Manyfactors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course.You will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in thefuture.  One thing we'll discuss in the class is how to fix dysfunctional teams.Nonetheless,toalleviateyourconcernsandtogradeyouappropriately, at the end of the term project you will be asked todivide 100 points among the members of your project team,excluding yourself, corresponding to how you believe they contributed to theproject as a whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish). In addition, eachteam member will be appraised for each phase.  This ``peerapportionment of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriateindividual grades for the project component.<H3> Team Organization</H3><P>There are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.Ensure that there is adequate coordination among the team members.Know each other's login names for electronic mail.Know each other's phone numbers.Meet <b>at least twice per week</b> (outside of class lecture)at the same, pre-determined time each week (so as to avoid confusion).  The Discussion Sectionis designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone.  You are stronglyurged to use that time slot.<p>Have a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even ifthe responsible manager becomes unavailable.<p>You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TAabout your progress, problems, questions, etc.<h3> Meetings</h3><P>Meetings are an important part of a team project.A successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definitepurpose and associated agenda (these are the responsibility of thephase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes(the responsibility of the phase clerical person).<P>The purpose of minutes is to record decisions madeand to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting.Each deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutesfor the team meetings held during the associated period of time.I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project web page.The minutes should outline<OL>  <LI> Date, time began, time ended   <LI>agenda for the meeting  <LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence<LI> major design decisions discussed<LI> task assignments made (i.e. action items) <LI>open issues<LI>questions to be asked and plan for getting them answered <LI> future meetings scheduled<LI>topics for next meeting. </OL><HR> <a name="costs"></a><H1> Cost and Benefits</H1><p>This course will demand a lot, but I think that you may well find thisto be the most rewarding courses that you will take in yourundergraduate career.  ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was<em> the most important </em> class that they took at UCI.  Thetechniques presented in class actually work and will help you in futuresoftware development.    <p>At the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of yourproject website/notebook for each team member.  Take them with you whenyou go to a job interview.  Students from past ICS 125 classeshave frequently said that it was their project notebook that clinched a job for them.  Some interviewers have commented that the quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and thequality of the product exceeds those of the production engineersin their companies.  <HR><a name="touch"></a><H1> Keeping in Touch </H1>Check the course syllabus page regularly.
