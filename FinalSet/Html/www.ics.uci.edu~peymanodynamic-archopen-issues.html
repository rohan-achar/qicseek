Possibleoperations include: creating and destroying components andconnectors, establishing or tearing down communication links,replacing one component for another, hierarchically nesting andunnesting components, interposing and &quot;wrapping&quot;components?</p><p>How should architectural changes be described?

Arenew processes and threads created for each new component? Arethere new memory management issues? ...</p><p>How can a component's internal state be preserved andtransferred to its replacement?</p><p>What aspect of the architectural model should be deployed withthe system to support runtime change and analysis?</p><p>What triggers a runtime change? Explicitly requested byend-users, implicitly through system monitoring (self-adaptive)?</p><p><strong>Architectural Model to Implementation Mapping</strong></p><p>Most systems currently assume a one-to-one mapping betweenmodel and implementation elements. Is this adequate? Is it usefulto support one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many mappings aswell?
