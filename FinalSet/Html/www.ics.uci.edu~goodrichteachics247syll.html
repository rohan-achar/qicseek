<ul>
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of homeworks,
class presentations, and a course project. The overall grade
will be determined 35% from homeworks, 25% from the midterm,
and 40% from the final exam.
Group work on homeworks is permitted, but each student must
list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem. If a student
turns in a solution without listing the others who helped produce this
solution, this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
(See the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>.)
Late homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>

<li><b>Text.</b> Pieprzyk, Hardjono, and Seberry, 
<cite>Fundamentals of Computer Security</cite>

<li><b>Add/drop policy.</b> All drop requests should be given to
Prof. Goodrich at office hours or by appointment. Drops will be
accepted only up to the fourth week. Once your drop card has been
signed, further coursework from you will not be graded. After the
seventh week of classes, withdrawals will be allowed only by
petition and under documented extenuating circumstances, in
accordance with ICS departmental policy.
