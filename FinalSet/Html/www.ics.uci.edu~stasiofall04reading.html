			The textbook in the class is Douglas R. Stinson,&nbsp;<EM>Cryptography: Theory and 
				Practice (2nd edition)</EM> .&nbsp; This is a very good reference book for 
			a lot of the material we will cover, but&nbsp;quite a lot of the&nbsp;material 
			we will do is not covered by this book.
		</P>
		<P>Below are&nbsp;pointers to both on-line and off-line background material for 
			this class.&nbsp; You might find them especially helpful when&nbsp;you run into 
			problems understanding something,&nbsp;would like to see an alternative 
			treatment of&nbsp;some subject, etc.

				<EM>Lecture Notes on Cryptography</EM></A>. &nbsp;This is the closest thing 
			to a "text book" for this class.&nbsp; These are notes from a summer 
			cryptography class given by profs. Shafi Goldwasser and Mihir Bellare at MIT. 
			&nbsp;The treatment here is focused on the theoretical foundations of 
			cryptography. &nbsp;This is similar to our approach in this class, although on 
			a more advanced level and sometimes in a different order.&nbsp; I very much 
			encourage you to look into this text&nbsp;for reference.</P>

			The following&nbsp;collections of lecture notes take a (more or less) similar 
			approach to the one we take in this class (except of Bellare/Rogaway notes 
			which emphasize symmetric setting more than we will).&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<P>Oded Goldreich's&nbsp;notes for his <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/%7Eoded/foc-book.html">
				Foundation of Cryptography</a> book are available on-line.&nbsp; Oded's 
			work is a&nbsp;comprehensive treatment of the theoretical foundations of 
			cryptography and it covers the material in&nbsp;far greater depth that our 
			class.&nbsp; It is recommended as a background reading, especially 
			for&nbsp;students who are interested in conducting research in cryptography.</P>

		<P>The following&nbsp;is a comprehensive reference book&nbsp;for all areas in 
			cryptography. It&nbsp;has a less careful approach to definitions and proofs of 
			security than we do, but it is a&nbsp;very good reference text.&nbsp; It is 
			available chapter by chapter from the book website:</P>

		<P>On the opposite end&nbsp;of the theory-vs-practice spectrum, the following book 
			presents only a very intuitive treatment of cryptography, and is a useful
