<BR>Defines two methods for Egyptian fraction representation: what he
calls the Farey sequence method, which is equivalent to the
<A HREF="cfrac.html#cfrac">continued fraction method</A> described here, and what he calls the continued fraction method, which is a variant of what
we call the
<A HREF="cfrac.html#grouped">grouped continued fraction method</A>.

<BR>Shows that every x/y with y odd has an
Egyptian fraction representation with all denominators odd, by using a method similar to the

</I><BR>Springer-Verlag, 1981, pp. 87&#173;93.
<BR>Guy lists a number of questions about Egyptian fractions, including the following:
<UL><LI><A HREF="smallnum.html">Does 4/y have a 3-term representation for all y?
</A>Does 5/y?  Does x/y for x sufficiently large relative to y?
<LI><A HREF="approx.html#odd">Does the odd greedy method terminate?
</A><LI>What different denominators are possible in a t-term representation of one?
Do all positive-density sets of integers have a subset forming the denominators of a representation of one?
<LI>If we assign to each of the integers one of a finite set  of colors, can we pick a single color that can be used as the denominators for representations of all rationals?
</UL>Guy also provides a long bibliography.

<BR>Concentrates  primarily on the question of
<A HREF="approx.html#odd">whether the odd greedy method halts</A>; notes that a similar method for finding representations with even denominators does halt; contains a number of further references.

<BR>Uses the

<BR>Stewart shows that any rational has only a finite number of t-term Egyptian fraction representations, for any fixed number t, and describes a

</A><BLOCKQUOTE>T. Takenouchi.
On an indeterminate equation.
<BR><I>Proc. Physico-Mathematical Soc. of Japan
</I>(3rd ser.) 3, 1921, pp. 78-92.
<BR>In this paper, discovered for me by Stefan Bartels, Takenouchi proves that any number with a k-term unit fraction representation has a representation in which all terms are distinct. Bartels writes "Takenouchi does not state the theorem itself but gives a proof to it. He uses the fact that the sum of the denominators of the representation increases and the fact that the number of representations of a given length is finite.  As far as I know this article has not been recognized in the meantime. I found some proofs (done in the 60s) which for example prove that n/m can be
represented as a sum of n Egyptian fractions. This shows that the article is (was) quite unknown in mathematical literature."
