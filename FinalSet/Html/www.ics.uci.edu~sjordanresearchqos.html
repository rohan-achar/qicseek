A widely used folk theorem is that multiplexing increases efficiency, and that the magnitude of the efficiency gain depends on the burstiness of the traffic, but often these relationships are often difficult to analytically characterize.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The first paper addresses the gains obtained by multiplexing bursty traffic operating under QoS contraints. The results establish a basis for the belief that   although bursty sources require more bandwidth, multiplexing gains are   increasing with burstiness. When heterogeneous sources are partially multiplexed, it also demonstrates that it is most efficient to group similar source types.</p>

          1995, pp. 785-797.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The second paper addresses a simple question: how do the optimal allocations of bandwidth and buffer vary with the number of   sources? For on/off fluid flows, the optimal buffer allocation is proven to be proportional to the square root of the number   of sources, and hence that allocation of a fixed buffer, or allocation of buffer linearly with the number of sources, can lead to substantial inefficiency.</p>

          1093-1104. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The third set of papers address the relationship between the network capacity and the number of data users that can be supported under a QoS criterion. Two types of QoS are considered: the average rate achieved and the probability that the rate is above a specified threshold. These results can be used to establish the cost associated with a QoS contraint on the basis of the network resources required.</p>
