      <h1>A Proposal for Web Metadata Operations</h1>

      <P><I>Draft v0.1, April 29, 1997</I></P>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      
      <P>This document provides rationale for why metadata support for
      Web resources is desirable, gives a model for separating
      existing metadata into small chunk and large chunk metadata,
      lists requirements for how to manipulate Web metadata, and
      provides a proposal which meets these requirements for how
      metadata can be created, deleted, and queried on Web resources
      using a set of extensions to the HTTP (version 1.1)
      protocol.</P>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <P>In its most abstract form, metadata is "information about
      information."  Information on the Web, known as Web resources,
      have many pieces of associated descriptive information which is
      often not explicitly represented in the resource itself.
      Examples of metadata include the creator of a resource, its
      subject, length, publisher, creation date, etc.  Such
      descriptive metadata can be used to make information easier to
      locate by improving Web searches [Weibel, 1995], rate
      information to protect children from indecent content
      (e.g. the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) [Miller
      et al., 1996]), capture copyright information, contain a digital
      signature, or store cataloging data.  Many other uses are also
      possible.</P>

      <P>Another type of metadata is the relationship.  A relationship
      captures an association between two or more resources, and can
      be one to one, one to many, or many to many.  Relationships can
      be used to capture navigational relationships, such as "go to
      this resource next," or a table of content, and can also express
      hierarchies (parent/child, successor/predecessor) [Maloney, 1996]
      Relationships have many domain-specific uses, such as a piece of
      software which has many "implements" relationships with a
      requirements document.  Annotations are another use of
      relationships in which the relationship points to commentary
      material on the resource.  The use of relationships to capture
      associations between data items is an old idea, stemming from
      semantic data modeling [Abrial, 1974][Hull & King, 1987], and
      early hypertext work on the NLS [Engelbart, 1968] and Xanadu
      [Nelson, 1981] systems.</P>

      <h2>Characteristics of Metadata</h2>

      <P>To date, there have been many techniques for describing metadata
      information.  On the Web there have been many mechanisms and
      proposals for metadata, including PICS [Miller et al., 1996],
      PICS-NG, the Rel/Rev draft [Maloney, 1996], Web Collections, XML
      linking, several proposals on representing relationships within
      HTML, digital signature manifests (DCMF), and a position paper
      on Web metadata architecture [Berners-Lee, 1997].  Related to the
      Web, but coming from a digital library perspective, are the
      Dublin Core [Weibel et al., 1995] metadata set and the
      Warwick Framework [Lagoze, 1996], a container architecture for
      different metadata schemas.   The literature on metadata
      includes many examples of metadata, including MARC [MARC, 1994],
      a bibliographic metadata format, RFC 1807 [Lasher, Cohen, 1995],
      a technical report bibliographic format employed by the Dienst
      system, and the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata
      conference describe many community-specific metadata sets.</P>

      <P>Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK
      [Lagoze, 1996], noted that, "new metadata sets will develop as
      the networked infrastructure matures" and "different communities
      will propose, design, and be responsible for different types of
      metadata."  These observations can be corroborated by noting that
      many community-specific sets of metadata already exist, and
      there is significant motivation for the development of new forms
      of metadata as many communities increasingly make their data
      available in digital form, requiring a metadata format to assist
      data location and cataloging.</P>

      <P>Based on an examination of many Web metadata proposals, it
      appears that Web metadata can be broadly characterized into two
      categories, termed small chunk and large chunk.  These are
      described below.</P>
      
      <h3>Small chunk metadata</h3>

      <P>Small chunk metadata includes data items such as:</P>

      <UL>
	<LI>HTTP headers
        <LI>short attribute-value pairs
        <LI>typed links (e.g. HTTP links, or binary relationships)
      </UL>

      <P>While developing a stringent definition of "small" is most
      likely impossible, since the definition is arbitrary, and seems
      to be based on unstated assumptions about retrieval performance
      (e.g., retrieval of small chunk metadata should be "trivially"
      or "unnoticeably" fast), much metadata has a small chunk flavor
      to it.</P>

      <P>Characteristics of small chunk metadata include: fast
      retrieval speeds, no need for content negotiation, no
      requirements on ordering, no need for "trust" information (e.g.,
      digital signature, author information, hash of contents, date of
      creation), and relatively simple value information.</P>

      <h3>Large chunk metadata</h3>

      <P>Large chunk metadata includes data items such as instances
	of:</P>

      <UL>
	<LI>PICS, PICS-NG collections
	<LI>Warwick collections
	<LI>MARC records
	<LI>Dublin Core records
	<LI>discipline-specific metadata records
	<LI>Web pages (e.g., an annotation page)
      </UL>

      <P>Like the smallness of small chunk metadata, the largeness of
      large chunk metadata is similarly difficult to define.
      Characteristics of large chunk metadata include: requirements on
      the ordering of fields, encoded trust information, pointers to
      metadata schema descriptions, complex data models, and multiple
      levels of containment.  Large chunk metadata often contains
      several instances of small chunk metadata.  Typically large
      chunk metadata is larger than small chunk metadata, although it
      is easy to develop classes of both for which this assertion does
      not hold.  As a result, there is an assumption that large chunk
      metadata takes longer to transmit than small chunk metadata.
      Large chunk metadata, when stored as a separate resource, has
      the advantage that several different representations of the
      information can be stored, such as translations into different
      natural languages, and then used in content negotiation.</P>

      <h3>Mapping of metadata to the Web data model</h3>

      <P>The mapping of metadata to the various data containers
      (resources, headers) in the Web data model varies depending on
      whether the metadata is stored on, in, or as a resource.</P>

      <P><I>On resource.</I> In this case, the metadata is stored with
      the resource, but is not a part of the resource itself.
      Examples include HTTP links, HTTP headers, PICS labels (using
      the PICS-Label header).  On resource storage is typically used
      for small chunk metadata, and on resource metadata is
      retrievable after 1 network request (a HEAD or GET).</P>

      <P><I>Within resource.</I> The metadata is embedded within the
      resource, and is a defined part of the document type
      description.  Examples include HTML REL/REV links, the HTML META
      tag, various HTML metadata proposals, Microsoft Word .DOC
      documents, and Web Collections.  Within resource metadata is
      retrievable in 1 network request (GET).  Within resource
      metadata has the advantage of being independent of access
      protocol, and is portable (when the resource moves, it does
      too).  Within resource metadata tends to be small chunk.</P>

      <P><I>Is (whole) resource.</I> The metadata is itself an entire
      resource.  When the metadata is an entire resource, there
      usually exists a relationship (link) between the described and
      metadata (describing) resources.  Examples include Web
      Collections, Warwick containers, Web pages.  Typically
      large-chunk metadata ends up as whole resource metadata, such as
      the MIME encoding of Warwick containers described in [Knight,
      Hamilton, 1996].  Typically retrieval of whole resource metadata
      requires 2 network requests (one to get the links, one to get the
      metadata).</P>

      <h3>Consistency maintenance</h3>

      <P>Many sources have noted that metadata can be viewed as an
      assertion about the described data.  In this view of metadata,
      an author attribute is viewed as an assertion that a particular
      person is the author of the information being described.  Since
      the Web is a client-server system, there are two points of
      control over these assertions.  With client controlled (or user)
      metadata, the consistency of the assertion is maintained by the
      user.  Typically the server is unable to perform any validation
      of client controlled (or maintained) metadata.  Alternately, the
      server can control the consistency of metadata assertions; one
      example is the last modified date of a resource.</P>
      
      <P>When metadata can be set by many different principals, as is
      the case on the Web, it is desirable to have some way of
      determining whether a particular assertion should be trusted.
      Trust information is a prominent aspect of the PICS container
      format, which contains a digital signature, contents hash,
      author information, and a valid date range which can be used to
      assess the trustworthiness of the assertions contained in the
      package.</P>
	
      <h2>Requirements for Operations on Web Metadata</h2>

      <P>The following are the relevant requirements for operations on
      Web metadata as specified in "Requirements for Distributed
      Authoring and Versioning" [Slein et al., 1997].
      
      <P>[5.1.1] It must be possible to create, modify, query, read
      and delete arbitrary attributes on resources of any media
      type.</P>

      <P>[5.2.1] It must be possible to create, modify, query, read
      and delete typed relationships between resources of any media
      type.</P>

      <h2>Proposal for Metadata Operations</h2>

      <P>In early WebDAV proposals [Goland et. al, 1996] all metadata was
      whole resource metadata, with the exception of the links used to
      hold the relationship between the described resource and the
      metadata resource.  While this approach handles large-chunk
      metadata well, it does have significant drawbacks for
      maintaining the referential integrity between metadata and the
      resource(s) it describes, especially when they are controlled by
      different principals.  To ensure that metadata could be created
      and retrieved in one method invocation, several convenience
      functions were proposed which created a link and the metadata
      resource in one action.  However, this led to difficulties in
      specifying the operations due to atomicity problems, and would
      be difficult to implement since a partial failure (e.g. link
      created OK, but metadata resource creation failed) would require
      rollback capability in the server.  Another significant drawback
      to this approach is the difficulty of providing searches on the
      value of the metadata.  While it was easy to propose a
      full-featured search on the type space of the links to the
      metadata, searches of the metadata itself quickly led to a
      consideration of the full resource searching problem, and
      difficult issues such as handling the wide range of natural
      languages and media types of resources being searched. </P>


	<P>Another early draft, the Netscape proposal [Cunningham &
	Faizi, 1996], gives operations for setting and retrieving
	attribute-value pairs stored in an attribute sheet associated
	with the resource. While this approach provides basic support
	for small chunk metadata, it lacks an attribute search
	mechanism, placing the burden of attribute searching on the
	client.  It also has no support for large chunk metadata,
	although this could be provided in a limited way by storing a
	URI pointer to large chunk metadata in the value of an
	attribute.
      </P>

      <P>Neither a pure whole resource metadata approach, nor a pure
      on-resource approach is able to handle the range of current and
      proposed Web metadata.  The whole resource approach has
      referential integrity problems, and the on-resource approach
      cannot handle the many large chunk metadata formats.  As a
      result, the proposal in this document uses a mixed approach for
      handling metadata, providing support for both on-resource, small
      chunk metadata and whole resource, large chunk metadata.  This
      mixed proposal provides operations for creating, deleting, and
      querying attribute-value pairs stored on Web resources.  Simple
      binary relationships are stored in "Link" metadata, which can
      point to large chunk metadata resources.</P>

      <P>The mixed proposal requires a modification to the object
      model for HTTP/1.1 resources to provide a repository for
      metadata state information in addition to the current
      repositories of state within an HTTP resource: the body and
      headers.  This new state information consists of attribute-value
      pairs, in which the attribute's name is a URI, and the
      attribute's value is an untyped octet stream.  URIs are used for
      attribute names to provide a distributed, extensible name space
      for attribute names.  URIs also have the capability, if
      dereferenced, of providing descriptive information on the
      syntax, semantics, and use of the attribute.</P>

      <P>Disadvantages of storing metadata in the existing HTTP object
      model lead to the desire to modify it.  While HTTP headers can and are used
      for small chunk metadata, they have drawbacks for distributed
      authoring.  Since users may potentially create the name of an
      attribute, this raises the possibility of name collisions with
      existing headers.  More importantly, since there could be
      potentially many attributes stored on a resource, it is
      important for network efficiency that these attributes not be
      returned with every GET or HEAD request.  There are many
      proposals for placing metadata inside a Web resource (e.g.,
      placing a PICS record inside a resource), however, there is no
      general way to define metadata in the body of resources of any
      media type.  As a consequence, placing metadata in the body
      would reduce metadata use to just a few specific resource media
      types, limiting the general use of metadata.  Since metadata in
      headers leads to network inefficiency, and metadata in bodies is
      impossible to generalize across all media types, it is necessary
      to add new state for attribute-value metadata to the HTTP/1.1
      object model.</P>

      <P>The sections below describe in detail new HTTP methods which
      can be used to create (ADDMETA), delete (DELMETA), search and
      retrieve (GETMETA) attribute-value metadata, including simple
      bidirectional links.  All of these methods may return a message
      body that contains a listing of attribute name/value pairs,
      however, the syntax for how to package these name/value pairs
      has intentionally not yet been specified.  It is hoped that one
      of the Web metadata packaging proposals currently being
      discussed (e.g., Web Collections or PICS-NG) will be useable as
      the return format for WebDAV metadata methods. Until these
      specifications have settled, it is premature to use them in a
      specification. </P>

      <h3>ADDMETA</h3>

      <h4>Body</h4>

<PRE>Body = *Pair
Pair = Name HT *Value CRLF
Name = URI
Value = Octet-CRLF | (CRLF HT)
Octet-CRLF = &lt;Octet excluding CRLF&gt;</PRE>

      <H4>Explanation:</H4>

      <P>The ADDMETA method is used to create one or more new
      attribute-value pairs on the resource specified by the
      Request-URI.  The body of the message MUST be of content type
      text/tab-separated-values, containing a sequence of attribute
      name/value pairs.  Each name/value pair consists of a URI
      attribute name, followed by a TAB, followed by a stream of
      octets which specify the attribute's value.  The value of the
      attribute may extend over several lines in the body, each
      extension line beginning with a TAB.  The name and value
      uniquely define a metadata item; there may be multiple instances
      of the same attribute name with different values, but only one
      instance of a particular name/value pair.  When used as the name
      of an attribute, the octets which comprise the URI are used to
      determine its uniqueness; if two (or more) URIs have different
      octet values, but are equivalent names for the same network
      resource (e.g., http://foo.com/bar.html and
      ftp://foo.com/bar.html), they are still considered to be
      different attribute names.</P>

      <P>The server MUST attempt to create all the included name/value
      pairs. The return message body (TBD) will indicate which creation attempts
      failed.</P>

      <H4>Example:</H4>

      <P>ADDMETA /foo.html HTTP/1.1<BR>
Host: ics.uci.edu<BR>
Content-Type: text/tab-separated-values<BR>
<BR>
http://www.purl.org/W3C/Dublin/Author<I>&lt;TAB&gt;</I>Jim Whitehead<BR>
DAV:/LINK<I>&lt;TAB&gt;</I>Type = &quot;DAV:/VERSIONING/HISTORY&quot;<BR>
<I>&lt;TAB&gt;</I> Source = &quot;http://ics.uci.edu/foo.html&quot;<BR>
<I>&lt;TAB&gt;</I> Dest = &quot;http://ics.uci.edu/foo.html/version_history&quot;</P>

      <H4>Response Codes</H4>

      <P>200 OK indicates the server successfully created all of the
	name/value pairs described in the request body.</P>
      
      <P>A server may reject entries because they are not consistent
      with the definition of the attribute. In that case a 406 Not
      Acceptable should be returned.</P>

      <P>Error conditions: empty body? Partial success/failure
	-- could not create one of the name/value pairs.</P>

      <P>TBD: A response message body indicating which name/value
	pairs the server was unable to create.</P>

      <h3>DELMETA</h3>

      <h4>Body</h4>

      <P>The body may either be of content type
      text/tab-separated-values, using the syntax defined for the
      ADDMETA body, or of content type application/dav-meta-search,
      using the syntax defined for the GETMETA body. </P>

      <h4>Explanation</h4>

      <P>The DELMETA method is used to remove a name/value pair from
      the resource specified by the Request-URI.  When the message
      body is of content type text/tab-separated-values, the server
      MUST remove any attribute name/value pair defined on the
      resource which exactly matches a name/value pair specified in
      the message body.</P>

      <P>When the message body is of content type
      application/dav-meta-search, the server MUST remove any
      attribute name/value pair defined on the resource which
      satisfies the search specification in the message body. If a
      server implements the GETMETA and the DELMETA methods, it MUST
      provide support for search specifications of content type
      application/dav-meta-search, and MAY accept search
      specifications in other formats and/or content types for the
      DELMETA method.  All search formats accepted by GETMETA SHOULD
      be accepted by DELMETA.</P>

      <h4>Response Codes</h4>

      <P>TBD -- need to reuse the response format from ADDMETA to
	return the name/value pairs which were removed.</P>

      <P>Error conditions: Syntax error in search syntax.</P>

      <h3>GETMETA Method</h3>

      <h4>Body</h4>

<PRE>Search = &quot;(&quot; &quot;OR&quot; *And-Expr&quot;)&quot;
And-Expr = &quot;(&quot; &quot;AND&quot; Name Value &quot;)&quot;
Name = &quot;(&quot; &quot;name&quot; search-pattern &quot;)&quot;
Value = &quot;(&quot; &quot;value&quot; search-pattern &quot;)&quot;
search-pattern = &lt;&quot;&gt;*(&quot;*&quot; | &quot;?&quot;
         | SpecialOctet | escaped-octet) &lt;&quot;&gt;
SpecialOctet = &lt;OCTET without &lt;&quot;&gt; or &quot;*&quot;
        or &quot;?&quot;  or &quot;\&quot;&gt;
escaped-octet  = &quot;\&quot; OCTET
</PRE>

      <h4>Explanation</h4>

      <P>The GETMETA method returns all attribute name/value pairs
      defined on the resource specified by the Request-URI which match
      the search syntax specified in the message body. If a server
      implements the GETMETA method, it MUST provide support for
      search specifications of content type
      application/dav-meta-search, and MAY accept search
      specifications in other formats and/or content types.</P>

      <h4>application/dav-meta-search media type</h4>

      <P>The application/dav-meta-search media type uses a subset of
      the s-expression syntax to specify an attribute search syntax.
      Searches are a logical or of limited regular expression matching
      of attribute name/value pairs.  Each name/value pair search is a
      logical and of regular expression matching on the name and the
      value of the attribute.  The &quot;*&quot; operator, which
      matches any sequence of zero or more octets, and the
      &quot;?&quot; operator, which matches a single octet, are the
      only regular expression operators allowed.  If a search needs to
      specify a literal &quot;*&quot; or &quot;?&quot;, these
      characters are escaped using the slash &quot;/&quot; convention,
      hence literal &quot;*&quot; is represented as &quot;/*&quot; and
      literal &quot;?&quot; is represented as &quot;/?&quot;.</P>

      <h4>Examples</h4>

<PRE>GETMETA /foo.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Content-Type: application/DAV-meta-search

(OR (AND (name &quot;http://ydfh&quot;) (value &quot;*&quot;))
    (AND (name &quot;foo:blah&quot;)(value &quot;*&quot;)))
</PRE>

<PRE>GETMETA /foo.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Content-Type: application/DAV-meta-search

(OR (AND (name &quot;*y?f*&quot;)(value &quot;*&quot;))
    (AND (name &quot;f*?h&quot;)(value &quot;*&quot;))
</PRE>

      <P>Assuming that the metadata available on
      http://www.ics.uci.edu/foo.html did not change between the requests,
      the response to the second GETMETA request should, at a minimum,
      include all the responses from the first GETMETA request.</P>

<PRE>GETMETA /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Content-Type: application/DAV-meta-search

(OR (AND (name &quot;*&quot;)(value &quot;*&quot;)))
</PRE>

      <P>The server will return a list of all attribute name/value
	pairs defined on the resource http://www.ics.uci.edu/index.html.</P>
      
<PRE>GETMETA /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Content-Type: application/DAV-meta-search

(OR (AND (name &quot;DAV:/LINK&quot;)(value &quot;*&quot;)))
</PRE>

      <P>The server will return a list of all links defined on the
	resource http://www.ics.uci.edu/index.html.</P>

      <h4>Response Codes</h4>

      <P>The response format for matching name/value pairs is TBD.</P>

      <P>Error conditions: syntax error in search syntax.  No matching
      name/value pairs?</P>

      <h2>Link Metadata Type</H2>

<PRE>Link := linkname HT linkvalue
linkname := &quot;DAV:/Link&quot;
linkvalue := Type SP Source SP Destination *(SP link-extension)
Source := &quot;Source&quot; &quot;=&quot; &lt;&quot;&gt; URI &lt;&quot;&gt;
Destination := &quot;Dest&quot; &quot;=&quot; &lt;&quot;&gt; URI &lt;&quot;&gt;
Type := &quot;Type&quot; &quot;=&quot; &lt;&quot;&gt; URI &lt;&quot;&gt;

link-extension = token [&quot;=&quot; (token | quoted-string)]
</PRE>

      <P>A link can be viewed as a piece of metadata stored on a
      resource, which can be stored in an attribute name/value pair.
      The Link predefined metadata type provides a standard syntax for
      expressing typed links with two endpoints.  By definition, the
      name of a link attribute is &quot;DAV:/Link&quot; and the value
      of the attribute is a triple consisting describes the link's
      type, source, and destination, and potentially some extra
      descriptive information.</P>
	
      <P>When recoding a DAV:/Link attribute, a server is only
      required to record the Source, Destination, and Type. It may
      drop all other information in the attribute value field if it so
      chooses. In addition a server MUST not record two links which
      have the same source, destination, and type but differ on other
      attributes.  A link is uniquely identified by the
      source/destination/type triple.</P>

      <P>Please note the use of &quot;:=&quot; in the BNF productions
      above.  This means that white space is never implicit,
