Abstract:
The authors explore novel aspects of visibility for stationary and moving
points inside a simple polygon P. They provide a mechanism for expressing
the visibility polygon from a point as the disjoint union of
logarithmically many canonical pieces using a quadratic-space data
structure. This results in a query time proportional to the size of
visibility polygon but without cubic space overhead of earlier methods.
<p>
By exploring the connection between visibility polygons and shortest-path
trees, the authors obtained a kinetic algorithm that can track the visibility
polygon as the viewpoint moves along polygonal paths inside a simple
polygon. The combination of the static and kinetic algorithms leads to a
new static algorithm in which the authors trade off space for increased
overhead in the query time.
