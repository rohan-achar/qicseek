tools would make them even more valuable. This paper describes our prototype
software, KLIMT (Classification - Interactive Methods for Trees), for interactive
graphical analysis of trees. The research is work in progress and there

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
This paper presents some graphical templates for constructing, describing,
and studying recursive partitioning trees. Some of the templates have multiple
applications. For example, the layout approaches for showing random trees
are generally applicable to the display of clusters. Thus the paper may
be of interest to those who make little use of recursive partitioning.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>The paper provides some perspective by raising a few general issues.
One issue concerns the limits of human sensory input and the resulting
conscious awareness. The limits are cause for humility in the face of overwhelming
quantities of data. For example one paper indicates using a recursive partitioning
algorithm on a problem with over two million variables. Analysts that would
look at the data on much smaller problems inevitably end up looking at
caricatures of the data. After making the assumption that it is still beneficial
to have analysts involved in the analysis process, it seems that thought
and computational power could be devoted to producing and prioritizing
caricatures that exploit analysts' visual processing strengths.
<p>In terms for constructing trees, a dynamic example shows the approach
of using grand tour, brushing, alphablending and graphical partitioning
to build trees. The visual approach uses linear combinations of predictor
variables. When the data view allows partitioning on more than one predictor
variable the approach includes a type of look ahead compared to a one variable
at a time algorithm. More generally the views can be smoothed regression
surfaces and various approaches can be used to graphically define multivariate
partitions. The view used for partitioning may not be well chosen. Thus
projection pursuit or related algorithms can help the analysts to select
views. Trees displays can use graphical representations to show the partition
boundaries. This can be done for traditional as well as graphically defined
partitions.
<p>The paper emphasizes graphical possibilities and does not evaluate the
quality of analyst defined trees. Adjusting the significance tests of human
defined partitions for multiple comparison is an open research question
with some algorithm emulation possibilities. More generally graphics can
be also be used in the evaluation process. One evaluation process generates
different trees by weighted random selection of prioritized variables at
each partitioning step. The paper closes by describing an approach to laying
out trees based on their similarities.</dl>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Predicting future outcomes based on past observational data is a common
application in data mining. The primary goal is usually predictive accuracy,
with secondary goals being speed, ease of use, and interpretability of
the resulting predictive model. New automated procedures for predictive
data mining, based on ``boosting'' (CART) regression trees, are described.
The goal is a class of fast ``off-the-shelf'' procedures for regression
and classification that are competitive in accuracy with more customized
approaches, while being fairly automatic to use (little tuning), and highly
robust especially when applied to less than clean data. Tools are presented
for interpreting and visualizing these multiple additive regression tree
(MART) models.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Boosting is a very effective computational procedure to improve upon an
initial estimator/classifier (weak learner). It comes from machine learning
and has had impressive successes on large real data sets.This talk takes
the recent gradient descent point of view of boosting to understand L2Boost
in regression and classification, especially its overfitting resistance.
In particular, we derive L2Boost's interesting exponential bias and variance
trade-off in regression, and approximate the 0-1 generalization error by
its smoothed version to argue for the importance of the bias-reduction
in classification, for the overfitting-resistance of the 0-1 loss function
through tapering, and for the failure of attempts to decompose the 0-1
loss as a sum of bias and variance. Moreover, we put forward the thesis
that the (proper) L2Boost in classification is not worse, or maybe even
better, than LogitBoost or AdaBoost. We conclude that the exponentially-diminishing
variance (and centered higher moments) plus the overfitting-resistance
of the 0-1 loss are responsible for the overfitting resistance of L2Boosting
(and possibly other forms of boosting) in classification.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

The last few years have seen an increased interest in model averaging techniques
such as bagging and boosting. To the statistician, the most interesting
aspect of these techniques is their resistance to over-fitting. I will
describe two theoretical explanations to this phenomenon. One explanation
applies to boosting (and other margin-based methods such as SVM). The other
applies to bagging (and other pseudo-Bayesian techniques).</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>These explanations differ from common statistical analysis in that they
are both based on ``non-generative'' models of the world. I will explain
how generative and non-generative models differ and why the difference
is important.</dl>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
In this work we develop a complete methodology for document classification
and clustering. Documents can be represented by high-dimensional vectors
of term/word frequencies. We study in depth the effect of dimensionality
reduction (via Principal Components Analysis), term weighting and frequency
transformation on both classification and clustering tasks. We conclude
that increasing the feature space dimension beyond a certain critical value
depending on the complexity and size of the data does not improve performance,
but worsens it; and applying a logarithm or square-root transformation
to the term frequencies reduces error rates. We used these findings to
construct a model based document clustering (MBDC) algorithm. This explicitly
models the data as being drawn from a Gaussian mixture. This is used to
construct clusters based on the likelihood of the data, and to classify
documents according to the Bayes rule. One main advantage of our approach
is the ability to automatically select the number of clusters present in
the document collection via Bayes factors. Our experiments with the Topic
Detection and Tracking Corpus demonstrates the ability of MBDC to choose
a sensible number of clusters as well as meaningful partitions of the data.
Moreover, motivated by the document clustering problem, we introduce a
novel algorithm to cluster high dimensional large data sets. This algorithm
uses model based clustering in the context of splitting the data into more
manageable subsets by way of fractionation. An extension to this method
(model based re-fractionation) is also proposed.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Many biologists are excited about emerging DNA microarray technologies,
since they make it possible for the first time to study the simultaneous
variations in activities of thousands of genes. There is a great need to
develop analytical methodologies to extract the information contained in
these rapidly growing data sets. Because of the large number of genes and
the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory
technique for analysis of such data. Among the many clustering algorithms
that have been proposed, model-based clustering stands out as one of the
few with rigorous probabilistic underpinnings. Namely, it assumes that
the data is generated by a mixture of underlying probability distributions
such as multivariate normal distributions. This Gaussian mixture model
has been shown to be a powerful tool for many applications. We will present
our experiences in applying model-based clustering algorithms to gene expression
data, compare it to some of the many other clustering approaches that have
been tried, and discuss challenges remaining in this field.</dd>

Multidimensional scaling is widely used to handle data which consists of
similarity or dissimilarity measures between pairs of objects. Major problems
in multidimensional scaling are object configuration, choice of dimension,
and clustering of objects. We propose a Bayesian approach to deal with
these problems, using a mixture of multivariate normal distributions as
a prior distribution of the object coordinates. A Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm is used to estimate the object configuration and group membership
simultaneously. A simple criterion to determine the dimension of object
configuration and the number of groups is proposed.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

We introduce a class of multi-scale models for time series. The novel framework
couples ``simple'' standard Markov models for the time series stochastic
process at different levels of aggregation, and links them via ``error''
models to induce a new and rich class of structured linear models reconciling
modelling and information at different levels of resolution. Jeffrey's
rule of conditioning is used to revise the implied distributions and ensure
that the probability distributions at different levels are strictly compatible.
Our construction has several interesting characteristics: a variety of
autocorrelation functions resulting from just a few parameters, the ability
to combine information from different scales, and the capacity to emulate
long memory processes. There are at least three uses for our multi-scale
framework: to integrate the information from data observed at different
scales; to induce a particular process when the data is observed only at
the finest scale; as a prior for an underlying multi-scale process. Bayesian
estimation based in MCMC analysis is developed, and issues of forecasting
are discussed. Two interesting applications are presented. In the first
application, we illustrate some basic concepts of our multiscale class
of models through the analysis of the flow of a river. In the second application
we use our multiscale framework to model daily and monthly log-volatilities
of exchange rates.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

We outline a novel unsupervised sequence segmentation algorithm motivated
by information theoretic principles. The algorithm, which segments the
sequences into alternating Variable Memory Markov sources, is based on
competitive learning between the Markov models, implemented as Prediction
Suffix Trees using the minimum description length principle. By applying
a model clustering procedure, based on rate distortion theory combined
with deterministic annealing, we obtain a hierarchical segmentation of
sequences between alternating Markov sources. The algorithm seems to be
self regulated and automatically avoids over segmentation. The method is
applied successfully to unsupervised segmentation of texts into languages
where it is able to infer both the number of languages and the language
switching points. When applied to protein sequence families, we demonstrate
the method's ability to identify biologically meaningful sub-sequences
within the proteins, which correspond to important functional sub-units,
known as protein domains.</dd>

We propose computation methods for sequential tests for a class of stochastic
processes for which the probability density of test statistic can be factorized
into a product of a known likelihood function that is independent of stopping
rule and a conditional probability that is independent of parameters. The
proposed methods improve accuracy and efficiency of computation and enable
us to valuate properties of special interests in sequential tests such
as the probability of discordance between a sequential test and the nonsequential
test at the last stage of the sequential test. We give examples for evaluating
sequential tests on information time with normal outcomes.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Optimizing communication network performance and detecting attacks and
intrusions requires knowledge of loss rates and queueing delays at different
points in the network. However, it is impractical to directly monitor packet
losses and delays at each and every router. Measurements at the edge of
the network (sources and receivers) are relatively easy and inexpensive
in comparison. Consequently, it is natural to consider the following inverse
problem: from edge-based measurements can we infer the loss rates and delays
experienced at internal points in the network ? This paper presents a unified
formulation of the problems of internal loss and delay estimation, and
describes an expectation-maximization algorithm for computing maximum likelihood
estimates. We also propose a new method for jointly visualizing network
connectivity and network performance parameters.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Stochastic models are well suited for the modeling of natural texture images.
The wavelet transform has also been useful in analyzing texture data. While
previous work has supported this, a factor limiting the widespread use
of such models is the high number of parameters necessary to describe the
model. Recent work has shown that the number of these parameters can be
reduced by making assumptions about the data, such as self-similarity of
the wavelet coefficients and other assumptions. We make further assumptions
about the wavelet transform (WT) coefficients in this work to include stationarity
of the WT coefficients as well as dependence within and across scales of
the WT coefficients. This is done by fitting an empirical version of a
stationary partially ordered Markov model (POMM) in the transform domain
both within and across scales. The POMM assume dependence of the WT coefficient
values in a local neighborhood in scale, and dependence of the parent node
in the adjacent scale with coarser resolution. An empirical pdf for the
POMM is found that is based on a quantized version of the WT coefficients.
The quantization into K states is performed by modeling the WT coefficients
with a mixture of two Gaussians and then estimating the parameters of the
Gaussians (the variance only, as we assume a zero mean). We use an expectation-maximization
algorithm to find the variances, as the states are considered unobserved
data. Maximum likelihood is used to determine the K states. Once the states
are found, the empirical POMM pdf is calculated, and this is the model
used to represent the data. Synthesis is straightforward and real-time
since the POMMs have an algorithm that produces a sample of its distribution
with a single visit to each of the pixel locations in the image. Examples
are shown of the synthesis technique for varying values of K and neighborhood
size for the POMM. Other applications are also being pursued, including
classification of texture data and encoding for storage and transmission.</dd>

our routine movements through and interactions with our physical surroundings
(automobile and air traffic, large-scale land use). In computer-mediated
settings, our activities either depend crucially on or consist entirely
of complex digital data (financial transactions, accesses to global information
systems, web site and internet usage). As a reflection of the diversity
and variety of the systems under study, these data-based descriptions of
our daily lives tend to be massive in size, dynamic in character, and replete
with rich structures. The advent of these enormous repositories of digital
information presents us with an interesting challenge: how can we represent
and interpret such complex, abstract and socially important data? In a
new collaboration, we have begun to give voice to a variety of internet-related
data streams. In our initial work, we studied traffic across the web site
www.lucent.com. Recently, our focus has been on capturing large-scale ``chatter''
on the web. We have built monitoring agents that allow us to collect streams
from thousands of public forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms. The incorporation
of textual components in our audio displays presents new and interesting
challenges. In this talk, we will try to put our work in context by presenting
a brief (and biased) review of the use of data in music compositions, as
well as previous attempts to incorporate sound directly into the process
of data analysis. This work is part of a Lucent program sponsoring collaborations
between researchers at Bell Laboratories and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
This talk will provide a conceptual introduction to causal inference, aimed
at assisting researchers gain access to recent advances in this area. The
talk will stress the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving
from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate
data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal
inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, and the
conditional nature of causal claims inferred from nonexperimental studies.
These emphases will be illustrated through a brief survey of recent results,
including the control of confounding, corrections for noncompliance, and
a symbiosis between counterfactual and graphical methods of analysis. Background

<b>The Defining Role of ``Principal Effects" in Comparing Treatments Using

<dt>
<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
We study the general and demanding problem of how to make treatment comparisons
that adjust for a post-treatment variable, because standard methods can
create post-treatment selection bias precisely in situations where there
is a scientific reason for the adjustment. We propose a general framework
for comparing treatments adjusting for post-treatment variables that yields
``principal effects'' based on ``principal stratification''. Principal
stratification with respect to a post-treatment variable is a cross-classification
of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that variable under
each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are defined as
causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal
strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and, therefore,
can be used as a pre-treatment covariate in defining any covariate-based
estimand. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is
that they are always causal effects, and do not suffer from post-treatment
selection bias. We discuss briefly that principal causal effects are the
link between two recently worked applications with post-treatment variables
on: (i) treatment noncompliance; and (ii) missingness of outcomes (dropout)
following treatment noncompliance. We then discuss the open problem with
surrogate endpoints, where we show, using principal effects, that all current
definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, cannot generally have
interpretation as causal effects attributable to the surrogate. We also
formulate a new approach based on principal stratification and principal
effects, and show that it has better properties than the standard methods.</dd>

Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world
learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are
generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in
advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based
active learning. Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the
learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can guide the sampling
process by querying for the labels of certain pool instances based upon
the data that it has seen so far. We introduce a new algorithm for performing
active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing
which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for
the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental
results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly
reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive
and transductive settings.</dd>

We present a framework for building probabilistic models to segment and
label sequence data using random fields that are globally conditioned on
the input sequence. Conditional random fields offer several advantages
over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including
the ability to relax the strong independence assumptions made in those
models, and to incorporate hierarchical and overlapping features into the
model. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of
maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models
based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states
with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms
for conditional random fields and compare their performance to HMMs and
MEMMs on synthetic and natural language data.</dd>

We introduce a general information theoretic method for extracting relevant
information from one set of variables about another, relevant, set. The
mutual information between two random variables answers the question: `what
is the minimal number of yes/no questions (bits) that are needed to be
asked about the variable X in order to learn all we can about the variable
Y?' This value does not tell you anything, however, on the content of these
questions. What is it that we need to know about the variable X that provides
information about the variable Y? We call (the answers to) these questions
the relevant components (information) in X about Y, and propose a general
method for generating such questions - relevant encoding of X with respect
to Y. We introduce both top-down and bottom-up algorithms for this task
and discuss their applications for data clustering, text categorization
and classification, word-sense disambiguation, and Bioinformatics. Based

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

We propose a split-merge Markov chain algorithm to address the problem
of inefficient sampling for conjugate Dirichlet process mixture models.
Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian mixture models,
such as Gibbs sampling, can become trapped in isolated modes corresponding
to an inappropriate clustering of data points. This article describes a
Metropolis-Hastings procedure that can escape such local modes by splitting
or merging mixture components. Our Metropolis-Hastings algorithm employs
a new technique in which an appropriate proposal for splitting or merging
components is obtained by using a restricted Gibbs sampling scan. We demonstrate
empirically that our method outperforms the Gibbs sampler in situations
where two or more components are similar in structure.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
In recent years, Neural Networks (NN) have become a popular data-analytic
tool in Statistics, Computer Science and many other fields. NNs can be
used as universal approximators, that is, a tool for regressing a dependent
variable on a possibly complicated function of the explanatory variables.
The NN parameters, unfortunately, are notoriously hard to interpret. Under
the Bayesian view, we propose and discuss prior distributions for some
of the network parameters which encourage parsimony and reduce overfit,
by eliminating redundancy, promoting orthogonality, linearity or additivity.
Thus we consider more senses of parsimony than are discussed in the existing
literature. We investigate the predictive performance of networks fit under
these various priors.</dd>

There are complex relative contributions of genetic and shared environmental
factors to an increased risk in melanoma. Data from the Queensland Familial
Melanoma Project comprising 15,907 persons from the 1,912 families of 2,118
melanoma cases were analyzed to estimate the additive genetic, common and
unique environmental contributions to variation in the age at onset of
melanoma. Two complementary approaches for analyzing correlated time-to-onset
family data were considered: the generalized estimating equations (GEE)
method in which one can estimate relationship-specific dependence simultaneously
with regression coefficients that describe the average population response
to changing covariates; and a subject-specific Bayesian mixed model in
which heterogeneity in regression parameters is explicitly modeled and
the different components of variation may be estimated directly. The proportional
hazards and Weibull models were utilized, as both produce natural frameworks
for estimating relative risks while adjusting for simultaneous effects
of other covariates. A simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for covariate
imputation of missing data was used and the actual implementation of the
Bayesian model was based on Gibbs sampling using the free ware package
BUGS. In addition, we also used a Bayesian model to investigate the relative
contribution of genetic and environmental effects on the expression of
naevi and freckles, which are known risk factors for melanoma.</dd>

Massive data sets challenge the limits of both computability and visualization.
It is therefore desirable to compress data sets; approximately $10^6$ to
$10^7$ Bytes seems desirable. This can be done by sampling (thinning) or
quantization (binning). Binning essentially maps the original sample space
into a new discrete sample space. It is commonly thought that data is sparse
(lumpy) in high dimensions. Binning therefore consists of identifying clusters
and determining statistical properties within clusters. Our proposal is
to identify statistical properties within bins and replace original data
with statistically equivalent data of a much smaller scale. This paper
explores these ideas.</dd>

This paper considers statistical issues in the analysis of a designed experiment
to investigate differential gene expression in colon cancer and normal
colon tissue. In this experiment gene expression is measured using radiolabeling--based
array filters. Specific statistical issues arise in connection with radiolabeling
technology, because of the absence of direct control, which are replaced
by empty spots on the filter, and with designed experiments, because of
the opportunity to systematically quantify important sources of random
variation. Here we consider three aspects in detail: normalization of expression
intensities; shrinkage estimates of intensity ratios between cancer and
normal tissue; and ranking of genes by the strength of the evidence that
they are differentially expressed. We propose a robust and simple--to--implement
procedures for normalization and shrinkage, that addresses in a technology--specific
way the problem of estimating ratios in presence of small and noisy denominators.
We also discuss a graphical display to rank genes using a metric based
on quantiles of a null distribution obtained by replicating the array experiment
in normal tissue.</dd>

In its most simple sense, a DNA microarray is defined as an orderly arrangement
of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of unique DNA molecules (probes) of
known sequence. There are two basic sources for the DNA probes on an array.
Either each unique probe is individually synthesized {\it in situ\/} on
a rigid surface, or pre-synthesized probes (oligonucleotides or PCR products)
are attached to the array platform (usually glass or nylon membranes).
Prior to the studies reported here, it was not clear whether comparable
data could be obtained by these different DNA microarray formats. Here
we report the use of rigorous statistical methods to compare data obtained
from {\it in situ\/} synthesized and pre-synthesized DNA microarrays, the
Affymetrix GeneChip${}^{\scriptstyle\rm TM}$, and Sigma Genosys${}^{\scriptstyle\rm

the necessity of replication and appropriate statistical analysis for the

The recent development of DNA microarray (DNA ``chip'') technologies for
parallel monitoring expression levels of a large number of genes holds
a promise of taking our understanding of molecular processes underlying
normal functions of living organisms as well as underlying mechanisms of
human diseases to a new level. The ability of the DNA microarray technology
to produce expression data on a large number of genes in a parallel fashion
has resulted in new approaches to identifying individual genes as well
as whole pathways involved in performing different biologic functions.
One commonly used approach in making conclusions from microarray data is
to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns across different
experimental conditions through a cluster analysis. Biologic significance
of results of such analyses have been demonstrated in numerous studies.
Various clustering procedures, ranging from simple agglomerative hierarchical
methods to optimization based global procedures and Self Organizing Maps,
have been used for clustering gene expression profiles. In identifying
patterns of expression, such procedures depend on either a visual identification
of patterns (hierarchical clustering) in a color-coded display or on the
correct specification of the number of patterns present in data prior to
the analysis (k-means and Self Organizing Maps). We developed a statistical
procedure based on the Bayesian Infinite Mixture model in which conclusions
about the probability of a set of gene expression profiles being generated
by the same pattern are based on the posterior probability distribution
of clusterings given the data. In contrast to the Finite Mixture approach,
this model does not require specifying the number of mixture components
and resulting clustering is a result of averaging over all possible number
of mixture components. We implemented a Gibbs sampling based algorithm
for generating sample from the posterior distribution of clusterings and
used it to identify groups of genes with similar expression profiles in
a publicly available dataset.</dd>

These calculations are based on a statistical mechanical approach in which
the governing partition function and other quantities of interest are evaluated
to a high degree of precision. Further computations to determine the positions
of all of the SIDD sites on the chromosome at the superhelical densities
encountered in topoisomerase mutant strains are currently underway. We
are using Hidden Markov Models to predict the location of all the high
affinity IHF binding sites on the {\it E. coli\/} chromosome.&nbsp; To
determine the {\it in vivio\/} occupancy of IHF at each of its chromosomal
binding sites, we are developing a procedure using {\it in vivio\/} IHF-DNA
crosslinking, immunoprecipitation and DNA microarrays that we call (CLIP-on-a-CHIP).
For these experiments, cells in log phase are treated with formaldehyde

Sampling methods have typically been used to counter the often prohibitive
cost of exact Bayesian calculations. I will discuss an alternative deterministic
approach to this problem based on variational methods. Variational methods
either generate adjustable simplifying transforms of the likelihood function
or operate in the space of distributions and find the best posterior approximation
within a simpler family of tractable distributions. The resulting variational
transforms are fast and lead to closed form posterior approximations over
the parameters and thereby provide an approximate posterior predictive
model. The methods can be readily extended to graphical models with complete
or incomplete observations with the help of additional variational transforms.
I will present the fundamentals of this approach and discuss its limitations
and relation to other approaches.</dd>

Mean field (MF) methods provide tractable approximations for the computation
of high dimensional sums and integrals in probabilistic models. By neglecting
certain dependencies between random variables, a closed set of equations
for the expected values of these variables is derived which often can be
solved in a time that only grows polynomially in the number of variables.
This talk deals with principled and general approaches for correcting the
deficiencies of simple MF methods which have their origin in Statistical
Physics. We also discuss the relation of these methods to belief propagation

The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method is a standard method that
searches for the distribution that maximizes entropy under a
given set of constraints. Roughly spoken, it selects the distribution
that satisfies the given constraints without introducing any
additional information. This talk will discuss MaxEnt applied
to graphical models. Here, the optimal model has not only to satisfy
a given set of constraints,  but also a given  set of independency
to graphical models. Here, the optimal model has not only to satisfy
a given set of constraints,  but also a given  set of independency
statements.
<p>
As an application, we show how MaxEnt in graphical models
can provide a practical tool for the assessment of model parameters
in graphical models that are build in collaboration with domain
experts.

A key issue in the consolidation process of the nuclear fuel cycle is the
safe disposal of radioactive waste. Deep geological disposal based on a
multibarrier concept is at present the most actively investigated option
(visualize a deep underground facility within which radioactive materials
such as spent fuel rods or reprocessed waste, previously encapsulated,
are placed, surrounded by other man-made barriers). While the safety of
this concept ultimately relies on the safety of the mechanical, chemical
and physical barriers offered by the geological formation itself, the physico-chemical
behavior of such a disposal system over geological time scales (hundreds
or thousands of years) is far from known with certainty. From 1996 to 1999,
with partners in Italy, Spain, and Sweden, we were involved in a project
for the European Commission, GESAMAC, which aimed in part to capture all
relevant sources of uncertainty in predicting what would happen if the
disposal barriers were compromised in the future by processes such as geological
faulting, human intrusion, and/or climatic change. One major goal of the
project was the development of a methodology to predict the radiologic
dose for people in the biosphere as a function of time, how far the disposal
facility and the other components of the multibarrier system are underground,
and other factors likely to be related to dose. For this purpose we developed
a complex computer simulation environment called GTMCHEM which ``deterministically''
models the one-dimensional migration of radionuclides through the geosphere
up to the biosphere. In this talk I will describe the application of methods
of functional data analysis (FDA) to explore the dependence of predicted
radiologic dose curves as a function of time on inputs to the computer
simulations. FDA includes extensions of traditional statistical methods
such as principal components analysis and the analysis of variance (ANOVA)
to the case where the outcome, instead of a single real number, is a curve,
in our case the logarithm of radiologic dose as a function of the logarithm
of time. Previous work in this field was limited to methods such as ANOVA
applied to the maximum of such curves; FDA thus permits a much more complete
investigation of the relationship between dose and time, and how this relationship
depends on the computer simulation inputs.</dd>

The evaluation of the costs and benefits of drinking water regulations
in the United States involves multiple disciplines, diverse datasets, and
widely differing expectations and beliefs among interested parties. The
debate over the EPA's recent proposal (and subsequent withdrawal) of a
new maximum contaminant level (MCL) for arsenic highlights the high degree
of uncertainty and importance of such an assessment. We present the results
of an integrated, Bayesian statistical assessment framework for evaluating
the costs and benefits of alternative MCL's for drinking water in the United
States. The framework includes: statistical models for the national distribution
of contaminant concentrations in (raw) source waters for the $\approx 56,000$
community water suppliers in the US; models for current treatment systems
in-place and their pollutant removal efficiencies; and resulting finished-water
concentrations, population exposures and health risks. The model also predicts
new treatments or other management options that will be adopted in response
to new MCL's, their costs, and exposure- and risk-reduction benefits. A
full uncertainty analysis is conducted, informed with available data sets
for raw-water concentrations, treatments-in-place, finished-water concentrations,
and health-risk data. The model is identified and estimated using Bayesian,
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The framework is illustrated for a single
contaminant (arsenic); and methods are discussed for evaluating multiple
MCL's for a suite of contaminants.</dd>

The problem of assessing uncertainties in complex computer simulation codes
is of increasing importance in many fields. This is particularly true in
environmental applications, where large and highly complex codes are used,
where the relevant science is not always clear, and where the implications
of errors can be enormous. Although the codes themselves are generally
deterministic, statistical methods provide powerful tools for quantifying
uncertainties. This talk concerns a range of Bayesian techniques that offer
an integrated framework for addressing problems in the use of such models.
One major source of uncertainty for the user of a model is often in specifying
values for relevant inputs. Running the model may typically mean assigning
values to physical parameters which are either unobservable or at least
cannot be measured on the scale assumed by the model. Uncertainty in these
inputs induces uncertainty on the model outputs, and the objectives of
sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are first to quantify this uncertainty
and then to explore the role of each uncertain input in the overall output
uncertainty. The standard techniques for such analysis involve Monte Carlo
methods, which make random draws from the distributions of the inputs,
run the code for each sampled input configuration, and thereby obtain a
sample of outputs. When the code may take some minutes, hours or even days
for a single run, the thousands of runs demanded by Monte Carlo methods
become impracticable. The Bayesian tools described in this talk can be
applied effectively with far fewer code runs.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

Complex ecosystem models are useful for investigating dynamics of systems
where multiple variables are interacting in a non-linear manner. Quantitatively
assessing the importance of input variables becomes more difficult as the
dimensionality of the model increases. Sensitivity analysis deals with
assigning influence measures to input variables for a given model. Local
sensitivity analysis deals with the modification of input parameters one
at a time. Although local sensitivity analysis is useful in some applications,
the region of possible realizations for the model of interest is left largely
unexplored. Global sensitivity analysis attempts to explore the possible
realizations of the model more completely. The space of possible realizations
for the model can be explored through the use of search curves or evaluation
of multi-dimensional integrals using Monte Carlo methods. Sensitivity measures
computed by these methods estimate the portion of the total variation of
the response that can be attributed to the input variable of interest through
an ANOVA-like decomposition of main and interaction effects. Methods of
sensitivity analysis such as Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
and the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST), provide tools that can
be used in global sensitivity analysis. To enhance the interpretability
of model output by providing a quantitative measure of the importance of
input parameters, application of such global sensitivity analysis tools
will be demonstrated through an modeling example of involving the performance
of buried radioactive waste.</dd>

I present new methods for optimizing portfolios, asset allocations and
trading systems based on Direct Reinforcement. In this approach, investment
decision making is viewed as a stochastic control problem, and strategies
are discovered directly. The need to build forecasting models is eliminated,
and better trading performance is obtained. The Direct Reinforcement approach
differs from dynamic programming and reinforcement algorithms such as TD-learning
and Q-learning, which attempt to estimate a value function for the control
problem. I present an adaptive algorithm called Recurrent Reinforcement
Learning (RRL) that enables a simpler problem representation, avoids Bellman's
curse of dimensionality, and offers compelling advantages in efficiency.
I demonstrate how Direct Reinforcement can be used to directly optimize
risk-adjusted investment returns (including the differential Sharpe ratio),
while accounting for the effects of transaction costs. In extensive simulation
work, we find that our approach based on RRL produces better trading strategies
than systems utilizing Q-Learning (a value function method) or trading
based on forecasts. Real world applications include a monthly asset allocation
system and an intra-daily currency trader.</dd>

In this paper we propose tests for individual and joint irrelevance of
network inputs. Such tests can be used to determine whether an input or
group of inputs ``belong'' in a particular model, thus permitting valid
statistical inference based on estimated feedforward neural network models.
The approaches employ well known statistical resampling techniques. We
conduct a small Monte Carlo Experiment showing that our tests have reasonable
level and power behavior, and we apply our methods to examine whether there
are predictable regularities in foreign exchange rates. We find that exchange
rates do appear to contain information that is exploitable for enhanced
point prediction, but the nature of the predictive relations evolves through

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Over the years, statistical problems given to the NSASAG have often been
considered through a Bayesian approach. This invariably raises the question
of ``How do you choose the prior?'' Ideally, one would want to know posterior
distributions for a wide variety of priors. If the posterior does not change
much when one changes the prior then one gets a feeling of reassurance---a
different investigator with a slightly different prior may not even bother
to recompute the posterior for his prior. On the other hand, if the posterior
changes significantly when one changes the prior, then it is important
to record that fact, so that for example more time is spent on prior elicitation.
Therefore, in almost any problem in which one carries out a serious data
analysis, one wants to calculate the posterior distribution for a large
number of prior distributions, especially in the exploratory stages of
the analysis. In many problems, the posterior is estimated through Markov
chain Monte Carlo, which may require non-negligible computer time, and
unfortunately this precludes consideration of a large number of priors
and an interactive analysis. To deal with this problem, we present a computing
environment within which one can interactively change the prior and immediately
see the corresponding changes in the posterior. The environment is based
on the object-oriented programming language LISP-STAT and an importance
sampling procedure which enables one to use the output of one or a small
number of Markov chains to obtain estimates of the posterior for a large
class of priors. The environment is very general and handles a wide range
of standard models, including for example GLM's and hierarchical models.</dd>

The use of density estimation to find clusters in data is supplementing
ad hoc hierarchical methodology. Examples include finding high-density
regions, finding modes in a kernel density estimator, and the mode tree.
Alternatively, a mixture model may be fit and the mixture components associated
with individual clusters. Fitting a high-dimensional mixture model with
many components is difficult to estimate in practice. Here, we survey mode
and level set methods for finding clusters. We describe a new algorithm
that estimates a subset of a mixture model. In particular, we demonstrate
how to fit one component at a time and how the fits may be organized to
reveal the complete clustering model.</dd>

several finite-state approaches to information extraction, culminating

probabilistic modeling of sequence data. CRFs offer several advantages
over hidden Markov models, including the ability to relax strong independence
assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid
a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other
discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which
can be biased towards states with few successor states. I will present
parameter estimation algorithms several models, as well as experiments

Hierarchical statistical models provide a flexible approach to the analysis
of gene expression data. They enable robust and efficient inference concerning
patterns of differential expression among cell types. One rationale for
these models is that with thousands of gene-specific questions, it is meaningful
to treat the gene-specific parameters as arising from array-specific or
cell-type-specific distributions, rather than treating them as fixed effects.
Two parametric formulations have proven to be effective: Gamma-Gamma-Multinomial
(GGM) and LogNormal-Normal-Multinomial (LNNM) characterize both fluctuations
in gene-specific expected expression and fluctuations in measured expression
given these underlying means. A nonparametric version of the model provides
further insight. I will discuss hierarchical statistical modeling in the
context of several experiments involving oligonucleotide chip sets. I will
try to demonstrate the utility of reporting the probability of various
forms of differential expression, and I will discuss model fitting, model
checking, and the role of an interesting arithmetic-geometric mean ratio.</dd>

John Tukey spoke and wrote concerning the uses and limitations of correlation

The two concepts have random process analogs and this paper considers the
case of stationary point processes and their use in a setup that is reasonably
well understood physically. The situation is that of the passage of the
extreme water flows through a series of locks along the Mississippi River.
The focus is on an investigation of the validity of partial coherency analysis,
an analog of partial correlation analysis. A maximum likelihood analysis

In this paper we propose Bayesian and frequentist approaches to ecological
inference, based on $R \times C$ contingency tables, including a covariate.
The proposed Bayesian model extends the binomial-beta hierarchical model
developed by King, Rosen and Tanner (1999) from the $2 \times 2$ case to
the $R \times C$ case. As in the $2 \times 2$ case, the inferential procedure
employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. As such, the resulting
MCMC analysis is rich but computationally intensive. The frequentist approach,
based on first moments rather than on the entire likelihood, provides quick
inference via nonlinear least-squares, while retaining good frequentist
properties. The two approaches are illustrated with simulated data, as
well as with real data on voting patterns in Weimar Germany. In the final
section of the paper we provide an overview of a range of alternative inferential
approaches which trade-off computational intensity for statistical efficiency.</dd>

In the environmental sciences, receptor models are used to evaluate the

Using pollution source profiles, profile uncertainties, and measurement
error variances, the chemical mass balance (CMB) model can be fit in order
to partition the ambient pollutants measured at the receptor into a collection
of source contributions. We discuss the use of the CMB model for the analysis
of a multivariate time series of air quality measurements, and we consider
estimation and inference procedures which account for the multiple sources

This talk concerns the application of statistical classification rules
for constructing land cover maps from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite
imagery. These maps are widely used for large-scale management by the USDA
Forest Service and other agencies for tasks such as prioritizing fire fighting
efforts. The classification problem begins with a Landsat TM scene (approximately
$170 \times 170$ km) that has been partitioned as a set of approximately
800,000 polygons. A training set (2000 to 5000 observations) is collected
by ground visitation, and a classifier is constructed from the training
set to assign land cover type (15-20 types) to the unsampled polygons using
the satellite imagery. Good map accuracy is difficult to achieve in mountainous
and forested landscapes because land cover type transitions are sometimes
indistinct, and because of satellite measurement error. This talk addresses
the application of ensemble methods (boosting and bagging), and combination
methods for improving classifier accuracy. Two classifiers are of particular
interest. I discuss a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier which estimates
group membership probabilities using the exact analytic bootstrap expectations
of a k-NN probability estimator. In other words, this classifier amounts
to the classifier that would be obtained from averaging all possible bagging
versions of a k-NN classifier. The second classifier is a simple spatial
classifier that uses the distance from polygons to training observations
to classify polygons. While the accuracy of this classifier is quite poor,
combinations of spatial and k-NN or tree classifiers are substantially
better than any of the constituent classifiers. The method of combining
classifiers is not particularly important; in fact, for these data, a very
simple method works nearly as well as any.</dd>

Sediment surface samples containing ostracodes from twenty-one locations

pertaining to the depositional variability of the Tecolutla River delta,
Mexico (Chen, Stanley, and Wright, 2000). Aquatic habitats such as an estuary,
offshore, a mangrove, tidal ponds, a marsh, and the river were surveyed.
The surface samples were analyzed for organic matter and grain size distributions.
The ostracodes were identified to their lowest taxonomic level. This paper
shows the results of several approaches to the analysis and interpretation
of this multivariate study. The methods of this paper provide different
approaches to the analysis and the interpretation of the interdependent
structures that exists in the aquatic habitats found in this riverine environment.
This paper discusses these findings from a traditional taxonomic viewpoint

Data mining is the search for patterns in (large) databases. In the last
couple of years I've been involved in the development of two data mining
systems and I'm about to start the development of a third system (geared
towards bioinformatics). In this talk I will tell you some of my experiences
and how they influence the design of the new system. I will especially
address efficiency issues related to the interrogation of large databases.
For example, what data structures in the database speed-up the query processing
and what type of query operators are necessary.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

Association rules are amongst the most important patterns that can be discovered
using data mining. Their discovery is supported by most, if not all, data
mining tools. The analysis and the interpretation of the discovered rules
is more difficult or almost impossible, given the huge number of generated
rules. In this paper we propose graphical aids and statistical tests to
overcome the main drawbacks of mining association rules: arbitrary thresholds
for support and confidence, huge number of association rules, meaningless
associations due to the presence of frequent itemsets and empirical evaluation
of the implications strength. We show how Double Decker plots can be used
to visualize association rules. These plots visualize the contingency table
that yields the association rule as well as the other potential rules in
that table, whether they meet the thresholds or not. This gives a deeper
understanding on the nature of the correlation between the left-hand side
of the rule and the right-hand side.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
The World Wide Web continues to revolutionize communication and information
systems. Measurements of its size and content provide us with insights
into the Web's future and suggestions for new Web tools. Our sampling of
the web found that the web though large is not as large as some industrial
databases. Our sampling of search engines found that search engines index
only a fraction of the web, do not index sites equally, and may not index
new pages for months. This talk discusses the impact of these results on
future Web search and makes suggestions for future Web tools and research.
We illustrate new techniques for information access on the Web, by describing
two approaches, metasearch illustrated by Inquirus, a content-based metasearch
engine, and by researchindex, a niche search engine, which is the largest
free full-text index of computer science literature. This is joint work
with Steve Lawrence, Kurt Bollacker and Eric Glover.</dd>

Considerable efforts have been dedicated to the development of sound procedures
for assessing the size of the World Wide Web. The problem is compounded
by the fact that sampling directly from the Web is not possible. Several
groups of researchers have found sampling schemes which consist of running
a number of queries on several major search engines. We present a new approach
to analyze datasets collected by query-based sampling, founded on a hierarchical
Bayes formulation of the Rasch model for multiple capture-recapture methodology.
We illustrate the approach using data gathered by Giles and Lawrence in
1997.</dd>

This work is in collaboration with Alfred Lin, Jing Huang, Neil Risch,

Curb, Beatriz Rodriguez, Victor Dzau, and many others. Part of the talk
will be a description of two ongoing projects in which I am involved, both
with many other individuals. Each is a search for genes that predispose
to what seems to be a polygenic disease. The first project is SAPPHIRe
(Stanford, Asian, and Pacific Program in Hypertension and Insulin Resistance),
a network of the NHLBI's Family Blood Pressure Program. The other is supported
by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation and is concerned with cardiovascular
diseases, in particular with genes expressed in vessel walls. Most of the
talk will be about defining phenotypes in general and so-called ``intermediate
phenotypes'' in particular. With SAPPHIRe we have applied k-means clustering
on variables, none marginally Gaussian, that quantify levels of plasma
lipids and the metabolism of insulin and glucose. Some technologies for
choosing ``how many clusters'' firmly choose two for the 597 women and
somewhat less certainly two for the 535 men. However, others insist upon
three clusters. The differences seem of interest, as statistics and as
biology. In each case, one cluster is clearly the ``not insulin resistant''
cluster. Cluster membership is significantly associated with hypertension
in women, much less so in men. We devised various permutation tests for
making inferences about these data, tests that respect family structures.<br>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Many businesses now use univariate statistical process control (USPC) in
both their manufacturing and service operations. Automated data collection,
low-cost computation, product design to facilitate measurement, and demands
for higher quality, lower cost, and increased reliability have accelerated
the use of USPC. However, in many situations the widespread use of USPC
has caused a backlash as processes are frequently adjusted or shut down
when nothing is really wrong because the probability of false positives
(Type I error) is calculated based on USPC and takes little or no account
of the multiple tests that are being performed or the correlation structure
that may exist in the data. Attempts to deal with these issues focus on
Bonferroni adjustments, Hotelling's T-squared statistics, and the generalized
variance. The problem of high dimensionality is commonly addressed by using
some form of dimension reduction such as principal component analysis (PCA).
Often these methods indicate that some sort of change has taken place,
but provide little information about the real nature of that change. In
this paper, we develop a multivariate detection method called eigenfactor
analysis which combines information contained in the matrix of eigenvectors
and the eigenvalues, and is capable of detecting new events and subtle
changes in the covariance structure of the process. Information regarding
covariance structure in the process can be crucial for feedback, tuning,
and control purposes. Unlike univariate cases where the distributions of
the null and alternative hypotheses are aligned on the same axis, the orientations
of two multivariate distributions can be much more complicated. Multivariate
PCA and T-squared techniques project the test samples on a distribution
model based on the training data; hence, such techniques assume alignment
in the distributions. Consequently, detection strategies that are capable
of differentiating directional drifts become very desirable. The paper
concludes with an example from semiconductor manufacturing where the goal
is to detect the end point in plasma etch using optical emission spectra.
Results using the new procedures are then compared with existing univariate
and multivariate process control techniques.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Data sharpening is a method of applying carefully chosen transformations
to data to obtain superior properties with simple methods of analysis.
For the case of kernel density estimation, we show that transformations
based on pilot estimates of the density and its derivatives can lead to
arbitrarily high orders of bias reduction in density estimation with second-order
(positive) kernels. Although the transformation is bandwidth-dependent,
it requires neither subsidiary smoothing parameters nor back-transformation.
Unlike estimates generated using traditional higher-order kernels, ours
are constrained to be nonnegative. Numerical studies demonstrate that they
also have improved mean square error properties and have fewer arbitrary
wiggles.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Detection of multivariate outliers using classical statistical measures
such as the mean and standard deviation is made difficult by the masking
effect, where the influence of multiple outliers on these measures limits
their identification. Robust methods have been developed which do not use
classical measures, but they tend to be computationally prohibitive and
are not feasible for use in very large data sets. Building on ideas of
Pe{\~n}a and Prieto (2001) and Rocke and Woodruff (2001), we investigate
the success of a variety of methods in detecting outliers with particular
interest in a mixture of algorithms - using a combination of classical
and robust methods to utilize the advantages of each method and thereby
achieve greater success than when utilizing the methods separately. We
thus investigate the performance of these algorithms on various types of
outliers and outlier clusters. We find that different algorithms perform
better for different types of outliers and therefore recommend a combination
of methods to achieve the highest possible outlier identification rate
when confronted with a data set containing unknown outlier types.<br>

In modern statistics the robust estimation of parameters is a central problem.
The Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), see, e.g.,~[Rous84], is probably
the most important robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter.
Its algorithmic complexity, however, was unknown and generally thought
to be exponential even if the dimensionality of the data is fixed. A number
of heuristics for solving the problem have been developed, e.g., Fast-MCD~[Rous99]
and Feasible Solution~[HaOl99]. Here we present a polynomial time algorithm
for MCD for fixed dimension of the data. In contrast we show that the MCD
problem is $NP$-hard if the dimension varies, hence one cannot expect to
find efficient algorithms in this case.<br>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

Forming a committee is an approach for integrating several opinions or
functions instead of favoring a single one. Selecting and weighting the
committee members is done in several ways by different algorithms. Possible
solutions to this problem is still the topic of current research. Our starting
point is the decomposition of the committee error into a bias- and variance-like
term. Two requests can be derived from this equation: Models should on
the one hand be regularized properly to reduce the average error. On the
other hand they should be as independent as possible (in the mathematical
sense) to decrease the committee error. The first request of regularization
can be handled by a Bayesian learning framework. For the second request
I want to suggest a new selection method for committee members based on
the pairwise stochastic dependence of their output functions, which maximizes
the overall independence. Given these pairwise similarity values the models
can be separated in classes by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. From
the error decomposition of committees I derive a criterion that allows
me to find the optimal number of classes, i.e. the optimal stop criteria
for the clustering algorithm. The benefits of the approach are demonstrated
for committees of neural networks on a noisy benchmark problem as well
as on some problems from the UCI repository.<br>

<b>Detection of Novel Samples in Mass Spectral Data Using Cluster Analysis</b></li>

We present an application of cluster analysis to the detection of novel
(unusual, outlying) samples in mass spectral data. These samples, unlike
the majority of the others, may represent novel chemical structures that
are of most interest to the scientists. Details of our specific application
are presented in [1]. A typical N by p data set consists of, N, nearly
a thousand mass spectral measurements, with intensities measured at p equal
to hundreds of mass-to-charge ratios. Since each sample can be represented
as a point in the p-dimensional space, search for unusual samples can be
considered as a search for the ``abnormal'' (outlier) points in this space.
While it is well known that outlier identification and clustering in such
high dimensions is extremely difficult, it will be argued that the nature
of the mass spectral data does not lend itself to dimension reduction.
There is significant attention in the data mining community to the outlier
detection problem in large, multidimensional data sets, see for example
[2-4]. Similar to [4], our approach utilizes hierarchical clustering to
solve this problem. Advantages of this approach are that, unlike many other
methods, it places fewer assumptions on the data, and can be used with
various distance (similarity) measures. Based on the clustering algorithm,
we developed a complete procedure for outlier identification. We start
from the working definition of outliers as those samples that are members
of clusters with ``small'' cardinalities, and are far away from clusters
with ``large'' cardinalities. A parameter, U, which depends on the expected
number of novel samples in the data, is used to define ``small'' clusters.
We note one monotonic feature of the hierarchical clustering algorithm:
the cardinalities of clusters that a sample belongs to is non-decreasing
with respect to the number of clusters. This feature of the algorithm allows
us to calculate a measure of outlyingness for each sample, kmin, which
is the smallest number of clusters at which the sample belongs to an outlying
cluster (a cluster with cardinality smaller than the threshold UN). Samples
are then ranked by their kmin values, and the top few are submitted for
further investigation by scientists. The use of the lowly populated clusters
is consistent with the hypothesis that novel samples should represent only
a small fraction of the data. We discuss the use of different similarity
measures in our method. In particular, we focus on those measures that
are traditionally used in the analysis of mass spectral data. We also present
a bootstrap procedure that is used to assess the ``confidence'' one should
have about the outlyingness of the samples identified by this method.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

Widely used parametric generalized linear models are, unfortunately, a
somewhat limited class of specifications. Nonparametric aspects are often
introduced to enrich this class, resulting in semiparametric models. Focusing
on single or k-sample problems, many classical nonparametric approaches
are limited to hypothesis testing. Those that allow estimation are limited
to certain functionals of the underlying distributions. Moreover, the associated
inference often relies upon asymptotics when nonparametric specifications
are often most appealing for smaller sample sizes. Bayesian nonparametric
approaches avoid asymptotics but have, to date, been limited in the range
of inference. Working with Dirichlet process priors, we extend the effort
of Gelfand and Mukhopadhyay (1995). In that paper inference was confined
to posterior moments of linear functionals of the population distribution.
Here, we provide a computational approach to obtain the entire posterior
distribution for more general functionals. We illustrate with three applications:
investigation of extreme value distributions associated with a single population,
comparison of medians in a k-sample problem, and comparison of survival
times from different populations under fairly heavy censoring.<br>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

In recent years, hierarchical model-based clustering has provided promising
results in a variety of applications. However, its use with large datasets
has been hindered by a time and memory complexity that are at least quadratic
in the number of observations. To overcome this difficulty, we propose
to start the hierarchical agglomeration from an efficient classification
of the data in many classes rather than from the usual set of singleton
clusters. This initial partition is derived from a subgraph of the minimum
spanning tree associated with the data. To this end, we develop graphical
tools that assess the presence of clusters in the data and uncover observations
difficult to classify. Using this approach, we analyze two large, real
datasets: a multi-band MRI image of the human brain and data on global
precipitation climatology. In the last case, we discuss ways of integrating
the spatial information in the clustering analysis. We focus on two-stage
methods, in which a second stage of processing using established methods
is applied to the output from the algorithm presented in this paper, viewed
as a first stage.</dd>

Bayesian computing should be more than the application of standard Bayesian

important to have a platform that encourages the development of new Bayesian
methodology and helps us extend the functionality of existing tools. There
are relatively few computing environments available for Bayesian computing.
In this talk I will discuss some of the functionality that is needed for
Bayesian computing and some of the implementations that are available.

Bayesian analysis systems typically have some input language for describing
probabilistic models upon which exact or approximate inference is to be
performed by one or more algorithmic engines. Here it is proposed that
many useful generative probabilistic models can appropriately be expressed
in the form of stochastic grammars, which recursively generate sets of
words with numerical parameters attached. The rules in these stochastic
parameterized grammars (SPG�s) each have the power of a Boltzmann probability
distribution, suggesting the use of mean field theory and other methods
for model inversion. Model composition arises at the level of multiple
rules in a grammar, and also at the level of entire grammars called as
subroutines to implement a rule in other grammars. This SPG viewpoint raises
new possibilities for interacting with subject domain experts to create
statistical models and data analysis algorithms, but raises new challenges
for the language or system implementor in the areas of mathematical notation,
algorithm composition (e.g. using clocked objective functions), and software
synthesis.<br>

One of the chief obstacles to effective data mining is the clumsiness of
managing and analyzing data in very large files. The process of model search
and model fitting often require many passes over a large dataset, or random
access to the elements of a large dataset. Many statistical fitting algorithms
assume that the entire dataset being analyzed fits into computer memory,
restricting the number of feasible analyses. Here we define ``large dataset''
as one that cannot be analyzed using some particular desired combination
of hardware and software because of computer memory constraints. There
are two basic approaches to this problem: either switch to a different
hardware/software/analysis strategy or else substitute a smaller dataset
for the large one. Here we assume that the former strategy is unavailable
or undesirable and consider ways of constructing a smaller substitute dataset.
This latter approach was named data squashing by DuMouchel, Volinsky, Johnson,
Cortes and Pregibon (1999) ``Squashing flat files flatter'' [KDD'99 Proceedings].
Formally, data squashing is a form of lossy compression that attempts to
preserve statistical information. Suppose that the original or ``mother''
dataset is a matrix $Y$ having $N$ rows or entities and $n$ columns or
variables. The squashed dataset is a matrix $X$ having $M$ rows and $n+1$
columns, where $M \ll N$. The extra column in $X$ is a column of weights,
$w_i$, $i = 1, \ldots, M$, where $w_i > 0$ and $\sum_i w_i = N$. It is
assumed that $M$ is small enough so that $X$ can be processed by the desired
hardware/software, and that the software can make appropriate use of the
weight variable. The $n$-dimensional distribution of the rows of $X$ weighted
by the $w_i$ is intended to approximate the distribution of the rows of
$Y$ well enough that statistical analysis of $X$ is an acceptable substitute
for the desired analysis of $Y$. A squashing procedure is evaluated by
how much more closely modeling of the squashed pseudo-data approximates
results from the full data than do the results from a random sample of
the same size. Methods for data squashing will be presented and compared.<br>

etc. together with identifying information such as the particular checkout
scanner and, for some transactions, customer identification. The total
data set contains billions of items which can be aggregated into hundreds
of millions of transactions for millions of repeat customers. This talk
will describe a number of analyses we have undertaken. Some of these have
simply focused on ascertaining the ``quality'' of the data while others
have been more narrowly focussed on simple questions like ``which pairs
of items are most frequently purchased together'' or ``what is the relationship
between basket size and number of baskets.'' The sheer size of the data
set has forced us to go beyond simple ``data mining'' methods and become
involved in ``meta-mining:'' the post processing of the results of basic
analyses.<br>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
The success of the 2000 census was due, in part, to the application of
new technologies such as image capture, Internet and laptop computers for
some data collection activities. In the coming decade the Census Bureau
is planning a program which integrates three components: collecting long
form data in a national survey, the American Community Survey (ACS); enhancing
the Master Address File and TIGER, a geographic database to bring into
compliance with GPS coordinates; and a re-engineered 2010 short form census.
By the next census in 2010 advances in technology will provide opportunities
for further successes. Research and testing will involve handheld computers
equipped with GPS for the creation of an initial address list and for use
in nonresponse and other field followup activities, enabling field workers
to enter responses directly into a computer file. The short form data collection
holds promise for expanding the Internet and other electronic reporting
options as modes for data collection. This paper describes the opportunities,
the benefits, and the challenges the Census Bureau faces using technology
in the 2010 census. The expanded use of technology in 2010 will greatly
reduce the Census Bureau's reliance on paper questionnaires.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
The U.S. Census Bureau's overall mission is to be the preeminent collector
and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and
economy of the United States. To accomplish this mission, the Census Bureau
has been using the Master Address File and the Topologically Integrated
Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) system for more than fifteen
years to support its various census and sample survey activities. In addition,
the MAF/TIGER database has been used as the foundation of the burgeoning
geographic information system (GIS) industry in the United States to support
the analytical programs and GIS activities managed by other federal agencies,
numerous state, local, and tribal governments, the private sector, and
academic organizations. The MAF/TIGER system is an aging national resource.
The Census Bureau needs to prepare for significantly more automation in
the 21st Century, including: improvement to street and other map feature
locations; addition of accurate housing unit locations, and enhanced feature
change detection methodology to provide more timely updates; and modernizing
the processing environment from ``home grown'' systems to one based on
COTS and GIS software. Accomplishing the needed improvements will increase
the effectiveness of the sponsoring and participating organizations that
depend on the Census Bureau's statistical data and its geographic infrastructure.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
High dimensional data sets from microarray experiments where the number
of variables (genes) $p$ far exceed the number of samples $N$ render most
traditional statistical tools of little direct use. However, some of these
statistical tools when used in conjunction with an appropriate dimension
reduction method can be effective. In this paper we introduce the use the
proportional hazard (PH) regression (Cox 1972) in conjunction with dimension
reduction by partial least squares (PLS), since the number of covariates
$p$ exceeds the number of samples $N$. This setting is typical of gene
expression data from DNA microarrays. Specifically, for a given vector
of response values which are times to event (death or censored times) and
$p$ gene expressions (covariates) we address the issue of how to assess
(estimate) the survival experience (curve) when $N \ll p$. The approach
taken to cope with the high dimensionality is to reduce the dimension via
some dimension reduction (component extraction) method in the first stage
and then estimate the survival distribution using a PH regression model
in the second stage. The primary method of component extraction considered
is PLS. PLS achieves dimension reduction by constructing components to
maximize the covariance between the response (survival times) and the linear
combination of the covariates (gene expressions) sequentially. This is
analogous to principal components analysis (PCA) but the optimization criterion
in PCA is variance rather than covariance in PLS. We demonstrate the use
of the methodology to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) textit{complementary}
DNA (cDNA) data set.<br>

<dd>
Gene expression in head and neck cancer patients was assessed by using
the Research Genetics cDNA membranes GF200 and GF211. The major objective
is to identify differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor
tissues. In the presentation, we will share many lessons we have learned
in acquiring, displaying, and analyzing the microarray data. Before the
data analysis, experimental condition need to be carefully documented.
For example, information on patient characteristics, tissue extraction
method, choice of primer, lot number and strip number of the membrane,
hybridization procedure, exposure time, and other parameters of image acquisition
all needs to be recorded. We performed duplicate experiments and, in some
cases, aligned the images multiple times to estimate the alignment variability,
experiment variability, and patient variability. The effect due to multiple
stripping of the membrane was also inspected. Standardization by background
correction and by the nonparametric regression based LOESS method was examined.
The differential expressed genes were identified by computing the raw folds
of change, the t-statistics, and change with respect to the interquartile
range. Exploratory graphical methods using the hexbin plot and brushing
methods were applied. Results of data analysis using various tools were
compared. The conclusion of the data analysis and its biological interpretation
will be reported.<br>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

Microarray technology, such as the Gene-Chip expression analysis probe
array (Affymetrix), generates expression levels for thousands of genes
from a single specimen. The array data are used to characterize genetic
differences between individuals or between types of tissue. However, statistical
properties of the data produced present challenges in the interpretation
of statistical analyses and identification of true outliers associated
with causal genes. The data deviate �wildly� from classical statistical
assumptions: normality, homoscedasticity, and additivity. In a well-known,
publicly available leukemia patients data set published by Gollub, et al.,
means and standard deviations varied over several orders of magnitude and
the cost-constrained, modest sample size precludes using asymptotic approximations.
A simple data transformation �tamed� the data to come reasonably close
to satisfying those assumptions by several ad hoc criteria. While the number
of genes measured exceeded the number of sample specimens 100-fold, a simple
dimensionality-reduction strategy ameliorated the multiplicity problem
and facilitated evaluation of group differences and covariate effects --
yielding more focused results for the transformed data than for the raw
data. Conclusion: The proposed paradigm for analyzing microarray gene expression
data yielded more precise, concise and reliable results.<br>

Evaluation of entropy is important in biological processes in order to
predict the stability of a molecular conformation. The entropy evaluation
requires probabilistic modeling of conformations in the internal coordinates.
Since fluctuations in the rotational angle (torsional) coordinates make
a pivotal contribution to the overall configurational entropy of the molecule,
we review circular probability modeling approaches for modeling the torsional
angles. Since macromolecules such as proteins have a very large number
of interdependent torsional angles and the distributions of many of them
could be multimodal and even skewed, we discuss theoretically and computationally
challenging problems that arise in the simultaneous modeling of these angles
based on data from molecular dynamics simulations.</dd>

A new method for computing the gamma cumulative distribution functions
and their inverses is presented in this paper. This method uses two continued
fractions for computation, one for the incomplete gamma function and the
other for the complement of the incomplete gamma function. An improved
interval method for computation and implemented as C++ language classes
is used. This is a self-validated computation. We developed programming
techniques to speed up the increment in the iterative loops for finding
the inverse of the gamma cumulative distribution function for a given probability.
In fact, the inverses can be considered random gamma variates if a uniform
random number generator is used to generate the probabilities over the
interval [0, 1). The entire computation only involves two simple algebraic
functions. There is no use of transcendental functions, auxiliary functions,
power series, or Newton's method in the computation. Therefore, one can
expect it is easy to implement.</dd>

<b>Smooth Quadratures of Volterra Integral Equations with Applications

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
Many scientific research problems arise as solutions to Volterra integral
equations of the first kind in which the given function $\mu(t)$ is expressed
as the integral over $(0,t]$ of the product of the known kernel $K(t,u)$
and the unknown function $\lambda(u)$ with respect to $u$, where $\mu(t)$
and $\lambda(t)$ are positive for $0 \leq t \leq \tau$, for some positive
$\tau$, $K(t,u)$ is positive for $t \geq u$ and is 0 for $t&lt;u$ and is
square integrable on ${(t,u)| 0 \leq t \leq \tau,0 \leq u \leq \tau}$.
In biomedical research problems, data for $\mu(t)$ and $K(t,u)$ often come
as step functions of time and so the method of quadratures may be employed
to solve the equation to estimate $\lambda(t)$ as a step function of time.
However, this method tends to yield negative and/or erratic values as solutions
of $\lambda(t)$. To obtain non-negative and smooth estimates of $\lambda(t)$,
we shall treat $\lambda(t)$ as the mean of a linear (non-homogeneous) Poisson
process and $\mu(t)$ as the mean of the translated planar (non-homogeneous)
Poisson process with $K(t,u)$ as the probability distribution of the translation
from the linear Poisson at u to the planar Poisson at t. We then construct
the likelihood function for $\lambda(t)$ in terms of the planar Poisson
point process at t and the probability distribution $K(t,u)$. An EM (expectation-maximization)
formula is derived for iterative estimation of $\lambda(t)$. Smooth nonparametric
maximum likelihood estimates of $\lambda(t)$ are then obtained by applying
the EM algorithm coupled with a smoothing step at each iteration. Accuracy
of the estimates of $\lambda(t)$ can then be checked by comparing the estimates
of $\mu(t)$, calculated from the Volterra equation using the estimated
solution of $\lambda(t)$ and the known distribution $K(t,u)$, with the
observed planar Poisson process via statistical goodness of fit tests.
Furthermore, by extrapolating the estimates of $\lambda(t)$ into the future,
the Volterra integral equation can be used to project the future course
of the $\mu(t)$ function. In this paper we have employed various parametric
and nonparametric distributions for $K(t,u)$ and applied the above method
to estimate the HIV infection rates and to make short term projections
of AIDS incidence using HIV/AIDS diagnosis data. The parametric distributions
(such as Weibull and gamma distributions and several new functions) and
non-parametric distributions (such as linear and cubic spline functions)
for $K(t,u)$ are so chosen as to take into account the fact that the HIV
screening test was available only since 1985 and the treatment made available
to the HIV positive patients only after 1987. Our method has produced results
that fit the observed AIDS incidence better than those produced by other
existing methods based on data from U.S., Canada and Australia.</dd>

Causal networks are generalizations of Ishikawa diagrams. Emphasizing tolerance
design applications, this work presents an optimal design algorithm when
the variables are organized as a causal network. The causal network is
transformed into a causal map, which represents all factors and responses
as points in a common D-dimensional metric space. The design approach is
algorithmic, optimizing Wynn�s entropy criterion. This criterion maximizes
dispersion among multiple responses, using a distance-in-space coefficients
(DiSCo) model. A key constraint is block self-containment--the blocks are
analyzable without reference to one another--complemented by all-block
analyses. Criteria are response dispersion, efficiency, and column rank.
Skewing blocks with off-target factors is explored.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

Data with high dimensional hierarchical structures often occur in longitudinal
studies, geographical studies or family studies. A usual approach is the
multi-level random-effects models. The situation of interest here is the
case when the number of clusters is small but the number of hierarchical
levels in each cluster is large. Particular interests focus on the heterogeneous
and unbalanced clustering. Multi-level models might have difficulty in
fitting data with unbalanced clusters. We propose designing correlation
with multi-layer structures, in which, each layer represents a unique parameterization
for correlation with a type chosen from generic structures such as AR,
exchangeable, stationary etc.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>In nested designs, a factor is nested in another and each factor has
multiple levels. In these cases, a layer of correlation corresponds to
modeling the correlation structure within a factor in the hierarchical
structures. A layer may consist of multiple blocks, and blocks of the same
layer have the same parameterization. These blocks represent the levels
of the factor associated with the layer. This approach can be easily extended
to unbalanced hierarchical structures and heterogeneous clusters. Algorithms
based on the approach are embedded in GEE methods. A case study from prostate
cancer and simulation studies show this approach is more efficient than
the existing GEE methods and multivariate methods.</dl>

The spectacular growth and acceptance of the Web has made it a very attractive
medium for interactive documents. Web-based reporting in industry, ``live''
documents in research, and interactive worksheets in education material
are in many ways ideal uses of the Web. These types of documents frequently
display dynamic, statistical output both in the form of text and plots.
Unfortunately, much of the effort in creating these types of documents
has focussed on re-inventing existing statistical software, and often with
inferior results. The reason is that systems such as S and SAS cannot be
integrated into the reader's browser.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>A better approach is to allow the author to create a document using
the common authoring tools (e.g. {\LaTeX}, MS Word or HTML editors) and
to conveniently insert dynamic and interactive components from other languages.
The author focuses on the presentation and display of these components,
including the usual multi-media elements such as text, images and sounds.
She uses HTML form elements and Java components to provide interactive
controls with which the reader can manipulate the contents of the document.
And finally she performs statistical computations and renders visual displays
using the statistical software that is embedded within the reader's browser.
<p>In this presentation, we describe how we have created an environment
for interactive statistical documents. It allows the author to use HTML,
JavaScript and R to create the content and the interactivity. The reader
accesses the interactive and dynamic functionality of the document via
a plug-in for Netscape that embeds R within it. The different languages
are all reasonably standard tools and each is used for the purposes for
which it was designed. This makes it a reasonably straightforward environment
in which to quickly and simply create interfaces for various different
applications and audiences.</dl>

We present a suite of user friendly S-Plus functions for fitting, among
others, (a) smoothing spline models for independent and correlated Gaussian
data, and for independent binomial, Poisson and Gamma data; (b) semi-parametric
regression models; (c) non-parametric mixed effects models; and (d) semi-parametric
nonlinear mixed effects models. The general form of smoothing splines based
on reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to model non-parametric functions.
Thus these S-Plus functions deal with many different situations in a unified
fashion. Some well known special cases are polynomial splines including
the popular cubic splines, periodic splines, spherical splines, thin-plate
splines, l-splines, generalized additive models, smoothing spline ANOVA
models, and self-modeling nonlinear regression models. These fixed/mixed
non-parametric/semi-parametric models are widely used in practice to analyze
data arise in many areas of investigation such as medicine, epidemiology,
pharmacokinetics and social science. One goal of this software development
is to collect existing programs and make them user friendly so that more
researchers can use them with ease. We have also written some new programs

Physicians typically compare a laboratory result for an individual patient
with previous values and population-based reference ranges to determine
the significance of any change. To provide a statistical basis for this
process, we previously developed an approach to sequentially analyze laboratory
test results and identify departures from past values. The statistical
methods include hierarchical multiple regression modeling with a weighted
minimum risk criteria for model selection to choose models indicating changes
in mean values over time. The �optimal� model was chosen as the one with
the smallest, statistically significant, weighted estimated risk as compared
to the null (no-change) model. For routine use in clinical settings, we
now describe the improved design and implementation of these numerical
algorithms for sequential change detection of the mean. Algorithms were
enhanced with analytical versions of matrices and were implemented using
the JAVA programming language. Input to the computer program included a
vector of sequential readings and desired statistical significance level.
Positive weight factors used in model evaluation were read from a stored
table. Efficient techniques were developed for computation of the Gasser,
Sroka, and Jenner-Steinmetz (GSJS) variance estimate and associated unbiased
risk (i.e. expected loss function), subset regression of indicator variables
on the input vector, regression residuals, and estimated auto-correlation
of model residuals. A GUI was constructed to support the numerical and
graphical input/output structure. Simulations were used to assess the speed
and portability of the JAVA implementation, termed Change Detector. We
analyzed data from patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens
($n=60$) to determine significant changes in hematocrit values. Compared
to the original S-plus implementation, we found the new JAVA program to
be as accurate, easier to use, and faster. We conclude that Change Detector
provides an improved statistical program for automated review of laboratory
data in the clinical setting.</dd>

Under two cost growth indices, annual absolute and relative cost growth,
probability-based models were constructed for basis functions of NASA's
technology readiness levels through the use of Johnson's four parameter
system of bounded, unbounded, or lognormal distributions. In addition,
statistical prediction models were built for the programs. The result of
this research shows that the program's initial cost estimate is the only
significant predictor for the program's annual absolute cost growth, while
the weighted average of technology readiness level from the program's components
is the only significant predictor for the program's annual relative cost
growth.</dd>

Several asymptotic approximation methods for computing the distribution
of a multiplicative risk model are discussed. We consider the asymptotic
expansion of $R=\prod_{i=1}^p x_i^{a_i}$ where $x_i$ are positive random
variables, which are independent but not identically distributed. The Generalized
Central Limit Theorem is used to provide an approximation for the distribution
of R and study conditions under which this approximation is valid. The
Edgeworth expansion of the distribution of R is discussed for the independent
and not identically distributed case. We will also discuss a saddlepoint
approximation to the distribution and quantile functions of the model.
The accuracy of the above approximations are illustrate in several examples
and the results are compared to the exact, when available, or Monte Carlo
results.</dd>

In the problem of estimating the parameter of the underlying probability
distribution, a sufficient statistic should be one that summarizes and
exhausts in itself all the relevant information on the parameter that is
contained in the sample. A similar basic problem of statistics is that
of predicting a future (that is, not yet observed) random variable on the
basis of some existing observable random variables when the parameter of
the underlying probability distribution does not concern us directly. Likewise,
we are looking for a statistic as one that is exhaustive of all the relevant
information on the future random variable that is available in the current
observable random variables. The notion of adequate statistics initiated
by Fisher and Skibinsky would deal with this concern. Subsequently, it
has been extensively investigated in literatures. In this article, we make
a comprehensive study of finding an adequate statistic for the total time
on test when the data is assumed to be exponentially distributed and censored
after the r-th failure.</dd>

There is much literature available on methods for comparing two measurement
systems that are supposed to be equivalent. These methods are briefly reviewed
in the context of comparing two in-vitro assays for measuring clotting
times where a new method is intended to replace an old method. The basic
study is a comparison of results run in both assays. With this study it
is possible to determine the relative performance of both assays with respect
to bias and variability (standard deviation) using techniques described
in Bland and Altman (1981) and Lin (1989) to determine if they are ``in
agreement''. But it is not possible for such a study to describe the bias
or variability of either assay. Usually there is much historical information
available for the ``old'' method. By incorporating that information it
is then straightforward to obtain point estimates of the bias and variability
of the new assay. Using distributional assumptions or bootstrap estimates
one can then obtain confidence interval estimates and conduct hypothesis
tests about the absolute and relative performance of the two assays. The
performance of various bootstrap and exact-distribution estimates is compared,
first in the context of ``demonstrating agreement'', and in the context
examining if the new assay has actually improved performance over the old
assay.</dd>

This paper considers the problem of Bayesian modelling and forecasting
for multivariate financial time series. For example, prices of related
stocks exhibit dependencies between series, as well as the usual dependencies
over time. The multivariate dynamic linear state space models of West and
Harrison (1997) are often appropriate for explaining log-price behaviour.
The problem of Bayesian inference for the underlying states and covariance
matrices has been examined by a variety of algorithms in the literature.
In order for some of these algorithms to work efficiently, a variety of
Kalman filtering, smoothing and simulation-smoothing techniques are required,
as na{\"\i}ve implementations suffer from problems associated with slow

We establish the relationship between the support vector machine and the
Bayes rule. The Bayes rule is the optimal classification rule if the underlying
distribution of the data is known. Therefore the Bayes rule is not directly
available in practice, but can be used as an ideal benchmark of any classification
procedure. We show that the support vector machine approaches the Bayes
rule in an asymptotic sense. The results are established under very mild
condition, allowing arbitrary number of discontinuities in the underlying
conditional probability function. This is in contrast with most other asymptotic
results in the statistical literature, where the underlying conditional
probability functions are assumed to be smooth to a given order. The results
clarify the mechanism beneath the support vector machine, and highlight
the advantage and limitation of the support vector machine methodology.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
For many practical applications one would rather have learning algorithms
compute accurate values of probabilities for each possible class, instead
of a single class label. Unfortunately, most of the existing classification
algorithms give poor class probability estimates because they were specifically
designed to maximize the classification accuracy and, as a result, the
learned models will output probability values that are more extreme (i.e.,
close to 0 and 1).</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This paper introduces a new lazy learning algorithm --- the Lazy Option
Trees --- based on which we derive a method for computing good class probability
estimates.
<p>Our algorithm builds on the basic ideas of the lazy decision tree classification
algorithm introduced by Friedman et al. (1996). In order to compute good
probability estimates, multiple tests are performed in each node on the
query instance. The algorithm also allows tests on continuous attributes,
and performs local smoothing in the leaf nodes. The class probability estimates
are improved using Breiman's Bagging.
<p>One of the most important uses of accurate class probability estimates
in machine learning and data mining is prediction in the presence of arbitrarily
large costs associated with the different kinds of errors. We tested our
method for different cost models and application domains from the UCI ML
repository and, for the majority of the tasks, its probability estimates
improve over the probability estimates of both decision trees and bagged
Probability Estimation Trees (unpruned, uncollapsed, and smoothed decision
trees; B-PETs) - one of the best existing class probability estimators.
For evaluating the quality of the predictions in a cost-sensitive context,
we employed the paired BDeltaCost procedure introduced by Margineantu \&amp;
Dietterich (2000).</dl>

Ensemble classifiers are some of the most accurate general-purpose classifiers

of perfectly-fit random trees. Compared to other ensemble methods, PERT
is very fast to fit. Considering the random nature of the trees, PERT is
surprisingly accurate. Calculations suggest that one reason why PERT performs
so well is that although the trees are extremely weak, they are also almost

Support Vector Machine (SVM) has shown great performance in practice as
a classification methodology recently. Even though SVM implements the optimal
classification rule asymptotically in binary case, one-versus-rest approach
to solve multicategory case using SVM is not optimal. We have proposed
Multicategory SVMs, which extend binary SVM to multicategory case, and
encompass binary SVM as a special case. Multicategory SVM implements the
optimal classification rule as sample size gets large, overcoming the suboptimality
of conventional one-versus-rest approaches. The proposed method deals with

We consider an iterative procedure to improve the misclassification error
rate of an initial classification rule. The proposed procedure involves
two steps: (i) an iterative method for generating a sequence of classifiers
from the initial one, and (ii) a combining procedure that ``pools together''
the sequence of constructed classifiers in order to produce a new classifier
which is far more effective (in an asymptotic sense) than the initial one.
The sequence of classifiers in step (i) are generated based on repeated
augmentation of the feature vector with some carefully constructed pseudo-predictors.
Both the mechanics and the asymptotic validity of the proposed procedure
are discussed. We will also discuss methods for selecting the number of
iterations.</dd>

In many longitudinal studies, the response can be modeled as a (discretely
sampled) curve over time for each subject. Often these curves have a common
shape function and individual subjects differ from the common shape by
a transformation of the time and response scales. Lindstrom (1995) represented
the common shape by a free-knot regression spline, and used a parametric
random effects model to represent the differences between curves. We extend
Lindstrom's work by representing the common shape by a penalized regression
spline, and use a parametric random effects model to represent the differences
between curves. The use of penalized regression splines allows for a generalization
in the modeling, estimation, and testing of parameters and is easily implemented.
An iterative two-step algorithm is proposed for fitting the model.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Conditional on the fitted common shape model, it is possible to fit
and test nonlinear mixed effects using standard methods. While the sieve
parametric form of the model suggests that a conditional likelihood ratio
test should be available for testing whether the shape varies with a time
invariant covariate, the null distribution of the likelihood ratio test
may not be chi-squared.</dl>

Predicting the biological activity of a compound from its chemical structure
is a fundamental problem in drug design. The ability exists to generate
vast amounts of potential pharmecutical compounds. Statistical and machine
learning methods can provide an efficient means of estimating the bioreponses
of these compounds in order to expedite drug design. In this paper we develop
a Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) methodology for estimating the
bioresponse of molecules based on the large sets of descriptors. Since
the concerned data is characterized by large numbers of descriptors and
very few data points, we adapt SVMr model selection and bagging strategies
in order to avoid overfitting. The proposed approach compares very favorably
with Partial Least Squares (PLS), a well-known and commonly used method
in chemometrics, on the performance of Quantitative Structure-Activity
Relationships (QSAR) analysis based on real chemistry data.</dd>

Backfitting is still the most popular numerical technique for generalized
additive models (GAM). Its implementation in S-Plus is stable and sufficient
for a large number of fitting problems. Here we take interest in GAM fitting
of rather complicated data showing patterns of correlation. As a result
we have to account for rank deficiency of the system matrix due to spatial
or temporal correlation of some variables. We illustrate this on an example
from human brain research. To cope with such situations we introduce the
idea of relaxed iterative projection generalized additive models (RIP-GAM).
What backfitting GAM and RIP-GAM have in common is the use of the same
S-Plus functions provided for generalized additive modelling such as s(),
the spline smoother, and other features. Main results from our example:
While RIP does not seem to run into numerical troubles, backfitting has
slow or no convergence in some instances. In standard situations, however,
both procedures produce the same estimation results).</dd>

We present a temporal Radial Basis Function (RBF) network for recursive

of two sub-RBF networks. One sub-network models the relationship between
the current network output and the past ones, and the other sub-network
describes the relationship between the current network output and the inputs.
In each sub-network, the kernel parameters of the hidden layer and those
in the output layer are all adaptively determined globally by using an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Xu 1998). The performance of our
proposed network is also demonstrated with a comparison to a classic one.</dd>

Several recent efforts have focused on adding exploratory data analysis
functionality to geographic information systems by means of various coupling
mechanisms between established statistical software packages and a GIS.
In this paper, we outline an alternative approach where the functionality
is built from scratch, using a combination of small libraries of dedicated
functions, rather than relying on the full scope of existing software suites.
The suggested approach is modular and completely freestanding, allowing
the use of data formats from different vendors. It combines within an overall
framework of fully dynamically linked windows a cartographic representation
of data on a map with traditional statistical graphics, such as histograms,
box plots, and scatterplots. In addition, it includes several devices to
visualize spatial autocorrelation in lattice (or regional) data, such as
the Moran Scatterplot and LISA maps. Apart from being freestanding, this
new program (DynESDA2) implements a number of other advances, such as the
capability to brush polygon coverages, simultaneous linking of multiple
maps with multiple statistical graphics, and interactive LISA maps.</dd>

As remote sensing instruments evolve, the size of imagery data sets derived
from remote sensing continues to increase. Several satellites currently
offer resolution of 1 meter per pixel or better. At this resolution, even
a small geographic area leads to a very large data set; 1 square mile,
for example, is represented by approximately $2.6 \times 10^6$ pixels.
Many sensors are now multispectral or even hyperspectral, increasing the
size of the data set by up to $10^2$. Processing images for classification
or mapping purposes thus poses an increasing computational challenge.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This paper describes the use of spatial statistics to compress the size
of large 1-meter imagery data sets. The images were taken over locations
in the United States using a CAMIS (Computerized Airborne Multispectral
Imaging System) instrument flown in an airplane and registered by trained
image analysts. Models of spatial variation are first computed on an entire
image, then on subsampled sets of the image. Parameters of the models are
used to compress the original image. Image analysis operations are then
performed on the original and compressed images and performance is compared.
In some cases it is possible to compress data several orders of magnitude
without substantially degrading results of subsequent analysis.</dl>

Statistical analyses of large-scale data can often be hard to interpret.
Many times several pages of numbers must be used to describe the data,
which makes finding the numerical output that is of interest tedious or
difficult. Converting these numbers into information that is understandable
and useful to someone without an extensive statistical background is also
a task that is not easily accomplished. Visual representations such as
maps, graphs, and charts can aid in this process. They help create a better
understanding through visual representation of the information and processes
the data is explaining. A recent improvement in visual statistics has been
the use of the Internet. The new Illumitek software tool, nViZn, the follow
up to the Graphics Production Library, is an interactive tool that allows
a user to expand or narrow the focus of a visual representation and to
order, overlay, and rearrange the format of the data, as fast as the user�s
connection can process without needing a statistical computing background.
The software also utilizes the Internet to give opportunities for easy
access to anyone with an Internet connection and a graphical user interface
without having to purchase a personal statistical computing package at
an impractical price. I will be using this new software by creating hierarchical
visual images, such as maps and charts, of data modeling concentration
estimates of 148 hazardous air pollutants for the 60,803 census tracts

Many databases exist by which it is possible to study the relationship
between health events and various potential risk factors. Among these databases,
some have variables that naturally form a hierarchical tree structure,
such as pharmaceutical drugs or occupations. For example, Ecotrin is a
brand of aspirin, which belongs to the class of nonsteoridal anti-inflammatory
drug, which in turn belongs to the larger class of analgesic drugs. As
another example, in the occupational classification system of the Census,
`statisticians' are a subset of `mathematical and computer scientists',
which are a subset `professional specialty occupations', which in turn
are a subset of `managerial and professional specialty occupations'.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;

<p>In this paper we propose a tree-based scan statistic for database surveillance
use, to be used when the independent variable can be defined in the form
of a hierarchical tree. The proposed method is illustrated by looking at
whether death from silicosis is particularly common among specific occupations
as classified by the Census Bureau, without preconceived idea of what specific
occupation or group of occupations may be related to increased risk, if
any at all. While the method can be used for many different types of databases,
the proposed method will be described in terms of `occupation' and `mortality'.</dl>

Recent work in classification indicates that significant improvements in
accuracy can be obtained by growing an ensemble of classifiers and having
them vote for the most popular class. This paper focuses on ensembles of
decision trees that are created with a randomized procedure based on sampling.
Randomization can be introduced by using random samples of the training
data (as in bagging or arcing) and running a conventional tree-building
algorithm, or by randomizing the induction algorithm itself. The objective
of this paper is to describe our first experiences with a novel randomized
tree induction method that uses a subset of samples at a node to determine
the split. Our empirical results show that ensembles generated using this
approach yield results that are competitive in accuracy and superior in
computational cost.</dd>

to see their accuracy in predicting diabetic status from the 8 variables
given. Looking at the 392 complete cases, guessing all are non-diabetic
gives an accuracy of 65.1\%. Since 1988, many dozens of publications using
various algorithms have resulted in accuracy rates of 66\% to 81\%. Rough
sets as a data mining predictive tool has been used in medical areas since

Radial basis function (RBF) models, a particular class of neural networks,
have recently become popular for pattern recognition tasks because of their
fast learning capability and good mathematical properties (best and universal
approximation). However, current algorithms for learning the model parameters
tend to produce inconsistent designs due to their {\it ad-hoc\/} and trial-and-error
nature. In this paper we develop a new mathematical framework for RBF design.
Specifically, we use singular value decomposition to study the complexity
of the interpolation ($G$) and design ($S$) matrices which form the foundation
of the SG algorithm proposed here. This algorithm provides a consistent
approach for determining the RBF parameters, viz. the number of basis functions
($m$), their widths ($s$) centers ($c$) and weights ($w$). It is shown
that $m$ can be obtained as the effective rank of $G$. For this purpose
a new model complexity measure ($D$) is introduced and its relationship
to singular values is derived. The centers, $c$, are determined by QR factorization
with column pivoting of right singular vectors of $G$. It is shown that
the selected $c$'s reflect the best compromise between structural stability
and residual minimization. Finally, the weights are computed by the usual
pseudo inverse method.</dd>

Tree ensemble or voting methods using re-sampling technique have been highlighted
recently in Statistical classification and Data mining. In this paper,
we propose a new ensemble method in decision trees that utilizes systematic
patterns of classifications. The new method improved the prediction accuracy
of a single decision tree algorithm. It is also expected that this method
performs reasonably well with fewer number of re-samples compared to the
popular Bagging or Boosting methods. An experiment with real dataset is
carried out to see the performance of the new method.</dd>

In the case of time series with a seasonal component, the well-known block
bootstrap procedure is not directly applicable. We propose a modification
of the block bootstrap that successfully addresses the issue of seasonalities,
and show some of its properties.</dd>

Sampling is central to evaluating inductive learning algorithms. Sampling
in relational data is far more challenging and error-prone than sampling
in non-relational contexts. We examine a class of algorithms for sampling
relational data, analyze the characteristics of the samples they produce,
and show that all have important pitfalls for unwary researchers.</dd>

We consider data from an infinite order moving average time series model
with inputs in a stable domain of attraction. The sample maximum of the
data is of interest in settings such as insurance and finance; we produce
a normalization of this statistic, which, in conjunction with subsampling
methods, will allow for asymptotically correct estimation of its cumulative
distribution function.</dd>

Control charts are widely used as effective online monitoring tools in
statistical quality control. Most of the existing methods for constructing
control charts are parametric in nature, and their applicability is much
restricted by the requirement of predetermined models such as normal distributions.
A nonparametric alternative based on bootstrap methods was proposed in
Liu and Tang (1996). Using both the standard bootstrap and the moving block
bootstrap, these new bootstrap control charts are valid for monitoring
independent data as well as dependent data. Assigning proper false alarm
rates to these bootstrap control charts, this paper develops a meaningful
threshold system for regulating and monitoring aviation safety data. The
threshold system can serve as a set of standards for evaluating the performance
of aviation entities, and provide guidelines for identifying unexpected
performances and assigning appropriate corrective measures. Consequently,
this threshold system can help achieve more effective regulation of air
traffic and safety. Both bootstrap control charts and threshold systems
are demonstrated in an analysis of aviation surveillance data collected
by the FAA from several air carriers. The demonstration uses the software
BootQC (Liu and Teng (2000)). BootQC is a Microsoft Excel Add-In file written
in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and its graphical user interfaces
can provide an easy access to online data analysis by applying bootstrap
methods to generating statistical quality control charts and threshold
charts.</dd>

<tt>Abstract:</tt></dt>

<dd>
In this paper, a new methodology based on the likelihood of bootstrap samples
is introduced for improving the efficiency of the two stage shrinkage testimator
of Waikar {\it et al\/} (2001) for estimation of a normal mean. In particular,
this method is useful for selecting the shrinkage factor for the two stage
testimator in view of increasing the efficiency of such testimator. The
method is useful for number of other estimation problems. However, in this
presentation only the estimation of the normal mean is considered for related
simulation studies and the discussion of results.</dd>
