<H1><CENTER>Chimera's Architecture</CENTER></H1>

<P>The architecture of Chimera 2.0 is conceptually separated into two distinct
environments. The first is the user's computing environment while the second
is a Chimera-enhanced website. Each environment contains a set of Chimera-related
components. The user's environment contains, for instance, a set of Chimera
clients, a Chimera server, and a Java-enabled WWW browser. This latter element
is able to host Java applets which can also be Chimera clients. A Chimera-enhanced
website contains a WWW server, its associated set of documents, CGI scripts,
and Java Applets, a hyperweb manager, a hyperweb server, a set of Chimera
2.0 hyperwebs, and a set of Chimera servers. This architecture is displayed
below.</P>

<P>The rest of this section is devoted to explaining in detail Chimera 2.0's
architectural elements. There are also sections available which display
the interactions of the elements in support of <A HREF="clientInteraction.html">clients</A>
and <A HREF="appletInteraction.html">applets</A>.</P>

<H2>User's Environment</H2>

<P>The user's environment refers to the tools and information located in
the user's local computing environment. This environment may be constrained
to one machine or it may be distributed across a local-area network. The
diagram above makes no attempt to display the possible configurations of
the environment, however the key requirement is that the applications located
within the environment have access to a shared file system. It is also assumed
that the applications are generating output on a display connected to the
user's physical machine. The idea behind this assumption is that the user
must be able to supply input to these applications. This latter assumption
also has the implication that a link traversal initiated by the end-user
always ends within an application the user can manipulate. We now discuss
the principle Chimera components found in a user's environment.</P>

<H3>Chimera clients</H3>

<P>As discussed in the <A HREF="../concepts/clients.html">client overview</A>,
Chimera clients are applications which provide users with hypermedia services.
These applications allow users to conduct work augmented by the authoring
and navigational services of Chimera. Some clients may not interact directly
with the user but instead provide services such as automatic link generation.
For instance, a client may be designed to process source code and automatically
link it back to its design documents. Other clients may provide Chimera-specific
services, for instance generating maps of Chimera hyperwebs. Typically,
users will invoke Chimera clients as needed through the course of their
work. However, on occasion, they may traverse a link which leads to an application
which is not executing. In this case, the Chimera server will invoke the
relevant client automatically.</P>

<P>Chimera clients contact Chimera-enhanced websites (where hypermedia information
is stored) via the Chimera server. Chimera clients can automatically detect
the presence of a local Chimera server and will connect to it when they
are first invoked. If a client is invoked with no Chimera server present,
the client will function as normal except that its hypermedia services will
be unavailable. If a Chimera server comes on-line subsequently, a well-implemented
client will allow the user to inform the client of this situation, e.g.,
via a menu item. The client can then connect to the server and, once again,
provide hypermedia services.</P>

<H3>Chimera server</H3>

<P>The Chimera server is an application the user invokes to interact with
the Chimera open hypermedia system. Its primary responsibility is to act
as a conduit between Chimera clients and the hyperwebs stored on Chimera-enhanced
websites. However, its secondary responsibility is to provide a user-interface
for the user to choose Chimera websites and hyperwebs, manipulate links,
and configure Chimera's behavior. Finally, the Chimera server also implements
link traversal and invokes clients needed as a result of a traversal. The
Chimera server, thus, plays a very similar role as a Web browser does for
the WWW. It is a single application which enables hypermedia services and
utilizes URLs to specify the location of websites and hyperwebs. The primary
difference is that the Chimera server does not display or retrieve hypermedia
content. Rather, it hands the responsibility of manipulating content to
Chimera clients while providing them access to the anchor and link information
stored in a remote Chimera hyperweb.</P>

<H3>WWW browser</H3>

<P>Most users are familiar with the services of Web browsers. Within the
Chimera context, Web browsers can be used in several different ways. First,
they can browse the information stored in Chimera hyperwebs with the use
of URLs. For instance the URL <CODE>&lt;http://www.some.domain/chimera/web1/links/&gt;</CODE>
would retrieve information about all of the links stored in the hyperweb
named <CODE>web1</CODE> located on the Chimera-enhanced website at <CODE>www.some.domain</CODE>.
(For more information, see the <A HREF="../../dev/docs/index.html">on-line
documentation</A>.) Second, the Hyperweb manager (discussed below) of a
Chimera-enhanced website supports a subset of the HTTP protocol. This enables
it to handle simple URL requests. For instance, the URL <CODE>&lt;http://www.some.domain:4009/hyperwebs/&gt;</CODE>
causes the Hyperweb manager to generate information about the hyperwebs
located on its site. Other URLs are available to query for other site-related
information, and all of this can be done from a standard Web browser. Finally,
a Java-enabled Web browser can execute Chimera clients which take the form
of a Java applet.</P>

<H3>Java applet</H3>

<P>A powerful feature of Chimera is the ability to provide hypermedia services
to Java applets. This allows a user to effortlessly link information stored
in the Web with information stored in their environment. It also enables
users to abandon the embedded links of HTML and to create links which are
stored separate from the Web yet enable traversal between information in
the Web. This change will ultimately lead to the integration into the WWW
of more sophisticated hypermedia services.</P>

<P>Java applets can be Chimera clients however they face obstacles not experienced
by normal clients. For example, applets face restrictions imposed by Java
itself. They cannot access the local file system, they can not determine
the identity of their user, and they can only access information and servers
located on the machine from which they were downloaded. These restrictions
translate into two requirements on the applet in order to be a Chimera client.
First, the applet and the information it provides must be located on a Chimera-enhanced
website. This enables the applet to contact the Chimera-related servers
executing at that site. Second, the applet must query the user for his or
her username, since Chimera needs to know the identity of the user accessing
its services. These two requirements are in addition to the <A HREF="../concepts/viewers.html#obligations">obligations</A>
placed on all Chimera viewers and <A HREF="../concepts/clients.html#obligations">clients</A>.</P>

<H2>Chimera-enhanced website</H2>

<P>A Chimera-enhanced website is a standard WWW site augmented with the
services of Chimera 2.0 servers. In addition to HTML documents and other
standard Web media, the website will contain Chimera 2.0 CGI scripts, Java
applets, and hyperwebs. The CGI scripts will enable the user to query and
configure Chimera via a standard WWW browser. The applets are Chimera clients
stored on the site to enable their communication with the Chimera 2.0 servers.
Finally, the hyperwebs are databases which contain hypermedia information
such as the anchors and links created on the views of hypermedia content.
Each of these components are discussed in further detail.</P>

<H3>WWW server</H3>

<P>The WWW server is a critical component of any website. It enables the
retrieval of documents, media, and applets from the site into a user's local
Web browser. With respect to Chimera, the WWW server provides a namespace
for Chimera hyperwebs. Each Chimera website and hyperweb has an associated
URL. CGI scripts are used to enable access to the contents of hyperwebs
from within a Web browser. Applets provide access to Chimera's services
and offer the ability to link web information with external entities. The
hierarchical nature of the WWW server's namespace nicely supports the hierarchical
nature of Chimera hyperwebs. The Web server thus provides Chimera 2.0 with
an operational context.</P>

<H3>Hyperweb manager</H3>

<P>The hyperweb manager is the high-level monitor of a Chimera-enhanced
website. The hyperweb manager has a dedicated port number (4009) like a
WWW server, easing a client's task of locating and connecting to it. It
has two responsibilities. First, it provides operations to create, delete,
and manipulate hyperwebs on its site. These operations are available via
its application program interface or direct HTTP requests. Second, it tracks
the connection information (hostname and port) for the other Chimera 2.0
servers running on its site. In order to connect to these servers, clients
first contact the hyperweb manager with a request for the connection information.
Once retrieved, they can initiate a connection to the desired server. In
this fashion, only the hyperweb manager need be in a pre-defined location,
all other servers can run on different machines with dynamic port numbers
for increased flexibility and efficiency yet be located easily by their
clients.</P>

<H3>Hyperweb server</H3>

<P>The hyperweb server manages access to Chimera 2.0 hyperwebs. It is directly
responsible for their persistence as well as their consistency in the face
of change. The latter responsibility is twofold. First, it enforces all
of the rules inherent in Chimera's hypermedia concepts. For instance, it
is illegal for a <A HREF="../concepts/viewers.html">viewer</A> to create
a <A HREF="../concepts/views.html">view</A> of an <A HREF="../concepts/objects.html">object</A>
whose type it does not support. Another example is that when an anchor is
deleted it must be removed from all links which contain it. Second, the
hyperweb server must ensure that the updates of one client do not overwrite
the updates of another. A simple locking mechanism is used to facilitate
this responsibility.</P>

<P>Chimera servers connect to hyperweb servers to provide their clients
with access to Chimera hyperwebs. All operations which manipulate the structure
of a hyperweb get forwarded from the Chimera server to the hyperweb server
for processing. Any results from the hyperweb server in turn get passed
back to the appropriate Chimera clients. In this fashion, a hyperweb server
focuses solely on the management of hyperwebs while Chimera servers are
free to focus on supporting and tracking the clients in their user's environment.</P>

<H3>Chimera server</H3>

<P>The Chimera server appears once again in the architecture due to the
Java restriction that an applet can only connect to a server on the machine
from which it was downloaded. Since applets can be Chimera clients and since
Chimera clients must connect to Chimera servers, there must be a set of
chimera servers running on the website to service applet requests. Note
that once an applet is connected to a Chimera server it is not restricted
to accessing the hyperwebs located on the site from which it was downloaded.
This is because the Chimera server is the entity which connects to the Hyperweb
server and being an application it has no connection restrictions. Thus
an applet is not cut off from the rest of the Chimera world and can participate
fully just as any other client due to the design of the architecture.</P>

<H3>Chimera hyperwebs</H3>

<P>A Chimera hyperweb is simply a database file located under a WWW server's
namespace which is manipulated by the Hyperweb server. It consists of instances
of Chimera's <A HREF="../concepts/index.html">hypermedia concepts</A> along
with their attributes. A website can have one or more hyperwebs and each
web can consist of a set of hierarchically composed subwebs.</P>
