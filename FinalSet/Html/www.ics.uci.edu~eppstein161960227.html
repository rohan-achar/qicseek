<h1>Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching</h1>

The problem: given a (short) pattern and a (long) text, both
strings, determine whether the pattern appears somewhere in the
text. <a href="960222.html">Last time</a> we saw how to do this
with finite automata. This time we'll go through the <a href= 
"people.html#knuth">Knuth</a>-<a href=
"people.html#morris">Morris</a>-<a href=
"people.html#pratt">Pratt</a> (KMP) algorithm, which can be thought
of as an efficient way to build these automata. I also have some <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/kmp/">working C++ source
code</a> which might help you understand the algorithm better. 

<p>First let's look at a naive solution.<br>
suppose the text is in an array: char T[n]<br>
and the pattern is in another array: char P[m].</p>

<p>One simple method is just to try each possible position the
pattern could appear in the text.</p>

<p><b>Naive string matching</b>:</p>

<pre>
    for (i=0; T[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
    for (j=0; T[i+j] != '\0' &amp;&amp; P[j] != '\0' &amp;&amp; T[i+j]==P[j]; j++) ;
    if (P[j] == '\0') found a match
    }
</pre>

There are two nested loops; the inner one takes O(m) iterations and
the outer one takes O(n) iterations so the total time is the
product, O(mn). This is slow; we'd like to speed it up. 

<p>In practice this works pretty well -- not usually as bad as this
O(mn) worst case analysis. This is because the inner loop usually
finds a mismatch quickly and move on to the next position without
going through all m steps. But this method still can take O(mn) for
some inputs. In one bad example, all characters in T[] are "a"s,
and P[] is all "a"'s except for one "b" at the end. Then it takes m
comparisons each time to discover that you don't have a match, so
mn overall.</p>

<p>Here's a more typical example. Each row represents an iteration
of the outer loop, with each character in the row representing the
result of a comparison (X if the comparison was unequal). Suppose
we're looking for pattern "nano" in text "banananobano".</p>

<pre>
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
      T: b  a  n  a  n  a  n  o  b  a  n  o

    i=0: X
    i=1:    X
    i=2:       n  a  n  X
    i=3:          X
    i=4:             n  a  n  o
    i=5:                X
    i=6:                   n  X
    i=7:                         X
    i=8:                            X
    i=9:                               n  X
    i=10:                                 X
</pre>

Some of these comparisons are wasted work! For instance, after
iteration i=2, we know from the comparisons we've done that
T[3]="a", so there is no point comparing it to "n" in iteration
i=3. And we also know that T[4]="n", so there is no point making
the same comparison in iteration i=4. 

<h2>Skipping outer iterations</h2>

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt idea is, in this sort of situation, after
you've invested a lot of work making comparisons in the inner loop
of the code, you know a lot about what's in the text. Specifically,
if you've found a partial match of j characters starting at
position i, you know what's in positions T[i]...T[i+j-1]. 

<p>You can use this knowledge to save work in two ways. First, you
can skip some iterations for which no match is possible. Try
overlapping the partial match you've found with the new match you
want to find:</p>

<pre>
    i=2: n  a  n
    i=3:    n  a  n  o
</pre>

Here the two placements of the pattern conflict with each other --
we know from the i=2 iteration that T[3] and T[4] are "a" and "n",
so they can't be the "n" and "a" that the i=3 iteration is looking
for. We can keep skipping positions until we find one that doesn't
conflict: 

<pre>
    i=2: n  a  n
    i=4:       n  a  n  o
</pre>

Here the two "n"'s coincide. Define the <i>overlap</i> of two
strings x and y to be the longest word that's a suffix of x and a
prefix of y. Here the overlap of "nan" and "nano" is just "n". (We
don't allow the overlap to be all of x or y, so it's not "nan"). In
general the value of i we want to skip to is the one corresponding
to the largest overlap with the current partial match: 

<p><b>String matching with skipped iterations</b>:</p>

<pre>
    i=0;
    while (i&lt;n)
    {
    for (j=0; T[i+j] != '\0' &amp;&amp; P[j] != '\0' &amp;&amp; T[i+j]==P[j]; j++) ;
    if (P[j] == '\0') found a match;
    i = i + max(1, j-overlap(P[0..j-1],P[0..m]));
    }
</pre>

<h2>Skipping inner iterations</h2>

The other optimization that can be done is to skip some iterations
in the inner loop. Let's look at the same example, in which we
skipped from i=2 to i=4: 

<pre>
    i=2: n  a  n
    i=4:       n  a  n  o
</pre>

In this example, the "n" that overlaps has already been tested by
the i=2 iteration. There's no need to test it again in the i=4
iteration. In general, if we have a nontrivial overlap with the
last partial match, we can avoid testing a number of characters
equal to the length of the overlap. 

<p>This change produces (a version of) the KMP algorithm:</p>

<p><b><a name="nest">KMP, version 1</a></b>:</p>

<pre>
    i=0;
    o=0;
    while (i&lt;n)
    {
    for (j=o; T[i+j] != '\0' &amp;&amp; P[j] != '\0' &amp;&amp; T[i+j]==P[j]; j++) ;
    if (P[j] == '\0') found a match;
    o = overlap(P[0..j-1],P[0..m]);
    i = i + max(1, j-o);
    }
</pre>

The only remaining detail is how to compute the overlap function.
This is a function only of j, and not of the characters in T[], so
we can compute it once in a <i>preprocessing</i> stage before we
get to this part of the algorithm. First let's see how fast this
algorithm is. 

<h2>KMP time analysis</h2>

We still have an outer loop and an inner loop, so it looks like the
time might still be O(mn). But we can count it a different way to
see that it's actually always less than that. The idea is that
every time through the inner loop, we do one comparison
T[i+j]==P[j]. We can count the total time of the algorithm by
counting how many comparisons we perform. 

<p>We split the comparisons into two groups: those that return
true, and those that return false. If a comparison returns true,
we've determined the value of T[i+j]. Then in future iterations, as
long as there is a nontrivial overlap involving T[i+j], we'll skip
past that overlap and not make a comparison with that position
again. So each position of T[] is only involved in one true
comparison, and there can be n such comparisons total. On the other
hand, there is at most one false comparison per iteration of the
outer loop, so there can also only be n of those. As a result we
see that this part of the KMP algorithm makes at most 2n
comparisons and takes time O(n).</p>

<h2>KMP and finite automata</h2>

If we look just at what happens to j during the algorithm above,
it's sort of like a finite automaton. At each step j is set either
to j+1 (in the inner loop, after a match) or to the overlap o
(after a mismatch). At each step the value of o is just a function
of j and doesn't depend on other information like the characters in
T[]. So we can draw something like an automaton, with arrows
connecting values of j and labeled with matches and mismatches. 

<p><img src="kmp.gif" width="580" height="197"></p>

<p> The difference between this and the automata we are used to is
that it has only two arrows out of each circle, instead of one per
character. But we can still simulate it just like any other
automaton, by placing a marker on the start state (j=0) and moving
it around the arrows. Whenever we get a matching character in T[]
we move on to the next character of the text. But whenever we get a
mismatch we look at the same character in the next step, except for
the case of a mismatch in the state j=0.</p>

<p>So in this example (the same as the one above) the automaton
goes through the sequence of states:</p>

<pre>
    j=0
            mismatch T[0] != "n"
    j=0
            mismatch T[1] != "n"
    j=0
            match T[2] == "n"
    j=1
            match T[3] == "a"
    j=2
            match T[4] == "n"
    j=3
            mismatch T[5] != "o"
    j=1
            match T[5] == "a"
    j=2
            match T[6] == "n"
    j=3
            match T[7] == "o"
    j=4
            found match
    j=0
            mismatch T[8] != "n"
    j=0
            mismatch T[9] != "n"
    j=0
            match T[10] == "n"
    j=1
            mismatch T[11] != "a"
    j=0
            mismatch T[11] != "n"
</pre>

This is essentially the same sequence of comparisons done by the <a
href="#nest">KMP pseudocode</a> above. So this automaton provides
an equivalent definition of the KMP algorithm. 

<p> As one student pointed out in lecture, the one transition in
this automaton that may not be clear is the one from j=4 to j=0. In
general, there should be a transition from j=m to some smaller
value of j, which should happen on any character (there are no more
matches to test before making this transition). If we want to find
all occurrences of the pattern, we should be able to find an
occurrence even if it overlaps another one. So for instance if the
pattern were "nana", we should find both occurrences of it in the
text "nanana". So the transition from j=m should go to the next
longest position that can match, which is simply
j=overlap(pattern,pattern). In this case overlap("nano","nano") is
empty (all suffixes of "nano" use the letter "o", and no prefix
does) so we go to j=0.</p>

<h2>Alternate version of KMP</h2>

The automaton above can be translated back into pseudo-code,
looking a little different from the pseudo-code we saw before but
performing the same comparisons. 

<p><b>KMP, version 2</b>:</p>

<pre>
    j = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
    for (;;) {      // loop until break
        if (T[i] == P[j]) { // matches?
        j++;        // yes, move on to next state
        if (j == m) {   // maybe that was the last state
            found a match;
            j = overlap[j];
        }
        break;
        } else if (j == 0) break;   // no match in state j=0, give up
        else j = overlap[j];    // try shorter partial match
    }
</pre>

The code inside each iteration of the outer loop is essentially the
same as the function <tt>match</tt> from the <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/kmp/">C++ implementation</a>
I've made available. One advantage of this version of the code is
that it tests characters one by one, rather than performing random
access in the T[] array, so (as in the implementation) it can be
made to work for stream-based input rather than having to read the
whole text into memory first. 

<p>The overlap[j] array stores the values of
overlap(pattern[0..j-1],pattern), which we still need to show how
to compute.</p>

<p>Since this algorithm performs the same comparisons as the other
version of KMP, it takes the same amount of time, O(n). One way of
proving this bound directly is to note, first, that there is one
true comparison (in which T[i]==P[j]) per iteration of the outer
loop, since we break out of the inner loop when this happens. So
there are n of these total. Each of these comparisons results in
increasing j by one. Each iteration of the inner loop in which we
don't break out of the loop results in executing the statement
j=overlap[j], which decreases j. Since j can only decrease as many
times as it's increased, the total number of times this happens is
also O(n).</p>

<h2>Computing the overlap function</h2>

Recall that we defined the <i>overlap</i> of two strings x and y to
be the longest word that's a suffix of x and a prefix of y. The
missing component of the KMP algorithm is a computation of this
overlap function: we need to know overlap(P[0..j-1],P) for each
value of j&gt;0. Once we've computed these values we can store them
in an array and look them up when we need them. 

<p>To compute these overlap functions, we need to know for strings
x and y not just the longest word that's a suffix of x and a prefix
of y, but all such words. The key fact to notice here is that if w
is a suffix of x and a prefix of y, and it's not the longest such
word, then it's also a suffix of overlap(x,y). (This follows simply
from the fact that it's a suffix of x that is shorter than
overlap(x,y) itself.) So we can list all words that are suffixes of
x and prefixes of y by the following loop:</p>

<pre>
    while (x != empty) {
    x = overlap(x,y);
    output x;
    }
</pre>

Now let's make another definition: say that shorten(x) is the
prefix of x with one fewer character. The next simple observation
to make is that shorten(overlap(x,y)) is still a prefix of y, but
is also a suffix of shorten(x). 

<p>So we can find overlap(x,y) by adding one more character to some
word that's a suffix of shorten(x) and a prefix of y. We can just
find all such words using the loop above, and return the first one
for which adding one more character produces a valid overlap:</p>

<p><b>Overlap computation</b>:</p>

<pre>
    z = overlap(shorten(x),y)
    while (last char of x != y[length(z)])
    {
    if (z = empty) return overlap(x,y) = empty
    else z = overlap(z,y)
    }
    return overlap(x,y) = z
</pre>

So this gives us a recursive algorithm for computing the overlap
function in general. If we apply this algorithm for x=some prefix
of the pattern, and y=the pattern itself, we see that all recursive
calls have similar arguments. So if we store each value as we
compute it, we can look it up instead of computing it again. (This
simple idea of storing results instead of recomputing them is known
as <i>dynamic programming</i>; we discussed it somewhat in <a href= 
"960109.html#dynprog">the first lecture</a> and will see it in more
detail <a href="960229.html">next time</a>.) 

<p>So replacing x by P[0..j-1] and y by P[0..m-1] in the pseudocode
above and replacing recursive calls by lookups of previously
computed values gives us a routine for the problem we're trying to
solve, of computing these particular overlap values. The following
pseudocode is taken (with some names changed) from the
initialization code of the <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/kmp/">C++ implementation</a>
I've made available. The value in overlap[0] is just a flag to make
the rest of the loop simpler. The code inside the for loop is the
part that computes each overlap value.</p>

<p><b>KMP overlap computation</b>:</p>

<pre>
    overlap[0] = -1;
    for (int i = 0; pattern[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    overlap[i + 1] = overlap[i] + 1;
    while (overlap[i + 1] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp;
           pattern[i] != pattern[overlap[i + 1] - 1])
        overlap[i + 1] = overlap[overlap[i + 1] - 1] + 1;
    }
    return overlap;
</pre>

Let's finish by analyzing the time taken by this part of the KMP
algorithm. The outer loop executes m times. Each iteration of the
inner loop decreases the value of the formula overlap[i+1], and
this formula's value only increases by one when we move from one
iteration of the outer loop to the next. Since the number of
decreases is at most the number of increases, the inner loop also
has at most m iterations, and the total time for the algorithm is
O(m). 

<p>The entire KMP algorithm consists of this overlap computation
followed by the main part of the algorithm in which we scan the
text (using the overlap values to speed up the scan). The first
part takes O(m) and the second part takes O(n) time, so the total
time is O(m+n).</p>
