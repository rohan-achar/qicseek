<H2> Abstract </H2>

The testing process is typically systematic in test data selection and 
test execution. For the most part, however, the effective use of 
test oracles has been neglected, even though they are a critical 
component of the testing process. Test oracles prescribe acceptable 
behavior for test execution. In the absence of judging test results 
with oracles, testing does not achieve its goal of revealing failures 
or assuring correct behavior in a practical manner; manual result checking is
neither reliable nor cost-effective. We argue that test oracles should be 
derived from specifications and in conjunction with testing criteria, 
represented in a common form, and their use made integral to the testing 
process. For complex, reactive systems, oracles must reflect the 
multiparadigm nature of the required behavior. Such systems are often 
specified using multiple languages, each selected for its utility in 
specifying a particular computational paradigm. Thus, we are developing 
an approach for deriving and using oracles based on multiparadigm and
multilingual specifications to enable the verification of test results 
for reactive systems as well as less complex systems.
