<H1> Overview, Prerequisites, and Frequently Asked Questions </H1>

<h3>
UCI Catalog Description:</h3>

<blockquote> Students work in teams to specify, design, construct, test, and document 
  a complete software system in a specialized application domain using application/domain-specific 
  techniques. Each offering's topic is announced the preceding spring.</blockquote>

<p>This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creating software 
  systems for which there was not adequate time or opportunity in ICS 125 or 126A. 
  A variety of advanced techniques are discussed, depending on the particular 
  applications targeted.
<p>All students are expected to attend all lecture sections. In general, there 
  will not be much lecturing in the class. Instead, class time will be highly 
  interactive, and all students are expected to participate. About half of the 
  time will be spent performing reviews of the artifacts developed. These reviews 
  will take up all lecture and discussion periods the week following the due date 
  for each deliverable. 
<h3>
Prerequisites:</h3>  
ICS 125 or 126A; Mathematics 2A-B-C.
<h3> Is the Lab Section required? </h3>

<p> Yes! The discussion section is essential: You will need to meet with your 
  teammates REGULARLY. EVERYONE needs to be in attendance at team meetings. The 
  discussion section time period is the guaranteed time period for you team to 
  meet. 
<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>

<p> We'll decide this the first week of classes. Some candidates:
<ul>
  <li> A replacement for the Jargo editor</li>
  <li>An enhancement to the ArchStudio 2.0 environment (see</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Embergman/ICS125/ICS125_WFUI.htm">A general 
    workflow editor</a></li>
  <li>A hand<a href="WAP%20Email%20Project.html">-held email device</a></li>
  <li>A follow on to one of the ICS125 FQ99 projects (e.g. IMPP, DAV posties, 
    ...) </li>
</ul>
<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>

<p> Same as ICS 125, and for the same reasons: Since ICS 127 has a strong team 
  project orientation, it is essential that the drop/add process be terminated 
  early. Therefore <em> NO drops or adds </em> will be permitted after the end 
  of the SECOND week of class. 
<hr>
<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>

<p> Topics will depend upon the interests of the students and the projects chosen. 
  The following list is representative of the topics that might be discussed in 
  class.
<ul>
  <li>Software architectures
  <li>Event-based systems
  <li>Application-layer Internet protocols
  <li>Inspections
  <li>Configuration management and version control
  <li>Web site usage for project management
  <li>Testing tools
  <li>Development environments
  <li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping 
  <li> Distributed software engineering 
  <li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology 
</ul>
Specific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects
chosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, are
concerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols and
Web technologies will be included.  Similarly if most projects will be
using some particular kind of infrastructure, such as CORBA or ActiveX,
then there will be lectures on that.

<h1> Assignments and Assessment </h1>
<P>
The project is the focus of this course and will be assessed
accordingly.  It will account for 80% of your grade; this is broken
down between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations.  The
remaining 20% will be divided among individual course logs, teamwork,
individual leadership demonstrated, and the final.

<h2>
Deliverables</h2>
<div align="left">The project nominally consists of five major assignments. Their 
  relative weighting (as a percentage of your final grade) of each deliverable 
  is indicated in the table below along with the due date. The on-line versions 
  of the assignments may still be under construction (watch the what's new section 
  to see when they are available). <br>

</table></center>

<p> The deliverables are weighted according to the relative amount of time and 
  effort we expect you will spend on each (and not necessarily on their importance 
  with respect to software development). Variations to this may be made to accommodate 
  the particular needs of a given project or a given team. Also, note that the 
  grade for a deliverable will consist not only of the document/specification, 
  developed during that phase but also the test plan developed along side it as 
  well as the review conducted in class. 
<h3>Deliverable Due Dates</h3>
<p>
Deliverables are due at 12:50 PM on the date indicated in the table above.
NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.
This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.
Since you are working in this class
as part of team, it is the team's responsibility to ensure that assignments
are turned in on time.  Normal excuses for late assignments, such as
illness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the
team is ill  :-)

<p> Unless directed otherwise, deliverables must be turned in directly to the 
  instructor or placed in the instructors's mailbox before that time. 
<h3>
Deliverable Reviews</h3>
Each deliverable will be reviewed in class. Each team will be given 15-20
minutes to present their project.  You will be given guidance in class on
how to conduct these presentations.

<p>
Your customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements review
as well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code
reviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is
your team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from
all relevant parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course
staff and clients as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is
a formality, however, and each team should have presented and negotiated
both relevant documents to the customer prior to the review (if you haven't,
it may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time).

<h3> Document Requirements</h3>
<P>
All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral
parts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date
existence is necessary for successful system development.
<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.  They must
reside permanently on your team's website.

<P>
All deliverable documents must be prepared on-line and be available as part
of your project home page either as either HTML or .pdf files.  NO MS Word files.
In general, the following should be observed.
<DL ><DT>Cover "page".
<DD> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving
<DL ><DT><DD> Project title
<DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable
<DT><DD> Date
<DT><DD> Team name/number
<DT><DD> Team members
<DT><DD> Phase manager
<DT><DD> Phase clerical person
<DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)
<P>
</DL>

<P>
<DT>Table of Contents.
<DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents
<DT>Specification.
<DD> The system specification (requirements, design,
module specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and
content to the outline provided for that phase.
Sections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked
``N/A''.
<DT>Minutes.
<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of
team meetings held during the associated period of time.


<DT>Performance Appraisals.
  <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by performance appraisals. Performance 
    appraisals shall NOT be maintained as part of the project's web page. A form 
    is available at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf"> 
    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf </a>. 
    A <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.ps"> 
    .ps file </a> is also available. I know that form is for ICS 125, but it will 
    work here too.
  <DT>Project WebPage.
<DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,  shall be maintained
in a project homepage.  
</DL>


<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>
<P>
For all deliverables, except for the last, you will also have the opportunity
to ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved
version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been
graded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial
version.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to
use the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a
bad design or specification.  You should keep the
same responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new
responsibilities for the next phase.


<H3> Course Log</H3>
<P> Throughout this course, just as in ICS 125, you will keep a course log recording 
  the time you spend on all activities related to this course. At the beginning 
  of each week you must email the previous week's log to the instructor. A sheet 
  showing what should be on the log is available at: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//logform.html"> 
  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/logform.html </a>. 
<p>
Keep a copy of your logs:  you will need them at the end of the quarter for the final
review.  

<P>
Each entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,
and text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:
<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;
<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;
<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.
</UL>

<p>
Most entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should
reflect and think about what is going on.
The time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records the
amount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter hour.

<P>
You will be marked down only for failing to email logs each week,
giving too little detail, or failing to keep track of time spent.  

<P>
You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors
you make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording
these errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the
kinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you
can improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention
to those areas in which you've had problems in the past.

<hr>
<a name="apportionment"></a>
<H1> Team Composition, Activities,  and Peer Apportionment of Credit</H1>
<P> At the end of the term project you will be asked to divide 100 points among 
  the members of your project team, corresponding to how you believe they contributed 
  to the project as a whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish). In addition, 
  each team member will be appraised for each phase. This ``peer apportionment 
  of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate individual grades for 
  the project component. 
<p> You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA about 
  your progress, problems, questions, etc. 
<HR>
<a name="touch"></a>
<H1> Keeping in Touch </H1>
Check the course syllabus page regularly<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Etaylor/ics127/syllabus.html"> 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics127/syllabus.html</a>. Announcements concerning 
assignments will be made there, changes to the lecture schedule will be announced 
there, and so on. 
<hr>
<a name="Teams"></a>
<h1> Teams and Meetings </h1>
<p> Meetings are an important part of a team project. A successful meeting requires 
  that the meeting have a definite purpose and associated agenda (these are the 
  responsibility of the phase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes 
  (the responsibility of the phase clerical person). 
<p> The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made and to be available for 
  updating any team member who misses a meeting. Each deliverable must be accompanied 
  by agendas and minutes for the team meetings held during the associated period 
  of time. I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project 
  web page. The minutes should outline 
<ol>
  <li> agenda for the meeting 
  <li> team members present and reason for any member's absence 
  <li> major design decisions discussed 
  <li> task assignments made 
  <li> future meetings scheduled 
</ol>
<p>As noted earlier, teams will use (at least) the discussion sections for team 
  meetings. <a name="teams"></a>

<H1> Computing </H1>

To facilitate sharing of files among team members, each team will have
an account on a Unix (Sun Solaris 2) machine, where the team web site
and project documents must be maintained.

<p>The primary computing facilities will be the <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab">ICS Labs</a>, which provide Sun
Solaris and Windows/NT machines.&nbsp; The <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/about/hardware.html">hardware

environment</a> is posted on the lab's web site as well as the <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/hours.html">lab hours</a> and
availability for Fall 1999.

<p>The system specification for each deliverable may be done on Suns, Macintoshes,
PCs, or any other available platform. Choice of computing platform for
implementation will depend on the projects chosen. Where possible and reasonable,
Java will be the implementation language used. (Scads of Java information
is available on-line, including a <a href="http://java.sun.com/tutorial/index.html">tutorial,
</a><a href="ftp://ftp.javasoft.com/docs/javaspec.ps.zip">reference
