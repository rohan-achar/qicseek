<ul>
<li><b>Course description.</b> 
Algorithms and data structures for geometric computation and graphics
programming. Fundamental problems of computational geometry such as
convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, polygon
partitioning, arrangements, geometric searching, hidden surface
elimination, motion planning.
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of homeworks,
a midterm, and a final exam. The overall grade
will be determined 40% from homework, 30% from the midterm, and
30% from the final.
Group work on homeworks is permitted, but each
student must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
Late homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>
</li>

<li><b>Exam policy.</b>
Exam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration
is allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams 
will be considered cheating.
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a 
failing grade in the class.
