<EM><strong><font size=+2>Automating the Web with WebL
</font></strong></EM><br>

The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), 
and off-the-shelf tools like web servers and web browsers are enabling 
technologies for cheap and efficient inter-business E-commerce. A side-effect 
of this development is that the web is turning into a large and semi-
structured database. However, in contrast to traditional relational 
databases, which can be accessed via SQL, the web has no query and 
manipulation language for performing tasks in an automated manner. We are 
specifically interested in automating tasks that require reliably filling 
in forms, retrieving and processing web pages, manipulating web pages, etc.

<P>

In this talk I will present a programming language called WebL, which was 
engineered for information processing on the Web. In contrast to other 
languages, WebL incorporates two novel features: service combinators and a 
markup algebra. Service combinators are language constructs that provide 
reliable access to web services by mimicking a web surfer's behavior when 
a failure occurs while retrieving a page. The markup algebra extracts 
structured and unstructured values from pages for computation, and is 
based on algebraic operations on sets of markup elements. WebL can be used 
to quickly build and experiment with custom web crawlers, meta-search 
engines, page transducers, shopping robots, supply chain integration 
systems, data aggregators, web mining, etc.

<EM><strong><font size=+2>Does Java Have Alternatives?</font></strong></EM><br>

At first sight, Java's position as the defacto standard for portable 
software distributed across the Internet seems virtually unassailable. 
Interestingly enough, however, it is surprisingly simple to provide 
alternatives to the Java platform, using the plug-in mechanism supported 
by the major commercial World Wide Web browsers.We are currently developing 
a comprehensive infrastructure for mobile software components. This is a 
long-term research activity and not directly related to Java and the World 
Wide Web. However, purely as a technology demonstration, we have started a 
small spin-off project called "Juice" with the intent of extending our 
experimental mobile-code platform into the realm of the commercial Internet.

<p>

Juice is implemented in the form of a browser plug-in that generates native 
code on-the-fly. Although our software distribution format and run-time a
rchitecture are fundamentally different from Java's, once the appropriate 
Juice plug-in has been installed on a Windows PC or a Macintosh computer, 
end-users can no longer distinguish between applets based on Java and those 
based on Juice. The two kinds of applets can even coexist on the same web-page.

<p>

This, however, means that Java can in principle be complemented by 
alternative technologies (or even gradually be displaced by something better) 
with far fewer complications than most people seem to assume. As dynamic code 
generation technology matures further, it will become less important which 
code-distribution format has the largest "market share"; many such formats 
can be supported concurrently. Future executable-content developers may well 
be able to choose from a wide range of platforms, probably including several 
dialects of Java itself.
