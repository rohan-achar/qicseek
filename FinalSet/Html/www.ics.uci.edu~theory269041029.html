Minimum Dilation Stars<br>
David Eppstein and Kevin Wortman
</h2>
The dilation of a Euclidean graph is defined as the ratio of distance
in the graph divided by distance in <I>R<sup>d</sup></I>.  We consider
the problem of positioning the root of a star such that the dilation
of the resulting graph is minimal.  We present a deterministic
<I>O</I>(<I>n</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)-time solution
to the decision problem, as well as a randomized
<I>O</I>(<I>n</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)
expected-time solution to the optimization problem.
<P>
The talk will cover selected results from a paper currently under 
preparation.
