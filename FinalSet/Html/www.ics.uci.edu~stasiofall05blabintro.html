		<h2>Handing in Lab Assignments</h2>
		<p>
			Each new lab assignment will be made available by&nbsp;Wednesday morning 
			through the class home page. An electronic copy of the lab will be due the 
			following&nbsp;Wednesday at midnight. To turn in the lab, log in to the <A href="http://eee.uci.edu/">
				UCI Electronic Educational Environment</A>, and upload the requested files 
			following the link you should have for the ICS.H22 class.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each .java file must include a comment template at the top. This comment should 
			have the following form:
		</p>
		<pre>// NAME: Your full name
// STUDENT ID: Your UCI student ID
</pre>
		Use the following ID for each submission: your UCI ID number '_HW' homework 
		number '_S' submission number (starting with 1). E.G., 12345678_HW3_S1. Only 
		your highest numbered submission will be considered for grading although all 
		copies will be checked for plagerism. Please only submit the .java source code 
		files (not your .class files or .vep files or any other files generated by the 
		compiler).
		<p>
		</p>
		<h2>Grading of Lab Assignments</h2>
		No late lab or homework assignments will be accepted. For this reason, I 
		strongly recommend that you get started on your homework assignment early in 
		order to avoid unexpected delays. In particular, you should read through the 
		lab assignment on the day that it is given and make sure that you understand 
		the instructions.
		<p></p>
		<p>
			Each program you submit (on homework, quiz, or the final exam) will be graded 
			on the following components: Program Design, Algorithmic Correctness, Coding 
			Style, Efficiency. You should review each assignment after it is returned to 
			make sure that you understand the reason for any deducted points and can 
			improve your performance accordingly.
		</p>
		<h2>Programming Environment</h2>
		You are free to select any programming environment of your choice. Many people 
		like to use the command-line compiler <strong>javac </strong>and virutal 
		machine <strong>java </strong>. This is what Minh will use in grading and 
		testing your code. The machines in the lab all come equipped with TextPad and 
		by default, use the compiler that comes with Sun Java 2 Standard Edition SDK.
		<p>
			Working in the lab is a good idea since help is more readily available there. 
			However, many of you may want to work on your programming assignments from 
			home. You are responisble for installing the necessary software on your own 
			machines. It is not realistic to expect us to provide support for your home 
			installations. Here is the software you will need to get started:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>A Text Editor. </strong>There are many to choose from. You can purchase 
				TextPad at <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">www.textpad.com </a>
			.<li>
				<strong>Sun Java 2 Standard Edition SDK </strong>. This is available for free 
				at <a href="http://www.java.sun.com/">www.java.sun.com </a>. It contains the 
				java compiler <strong>javac </strong>and the virtual machine java and all the 
				libraries you will need for programming in Java for this course. We will be 
				using version 1.5. The following link is to the Java API for version 1.5 and 
				will be invaluable in using Java's wealth of pre-defined classes <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/">
					Java API </a>. If you are interested in some documentation on the new 
				version of Java, an over view can be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15/">
					http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15/ </a>. More 
				details can be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/relnotes/features.html">
					http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/relnotes/features.html </a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		For more on setting up Java on your home machine, see Prof. Alex Thorntons web 
		page <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ethornton/ics22/LabManual/SettingUpJava.html">
			Setting Up Java On Your Home Machine </a>.
		<p>
			Many people also like to use an integrated development environment (IDE). These 
			provide an editor, compiler, virtual machine and usually other tools, such as a 
			debugger. A relatively easy one to get started with is BlueJ. BlueJ is 
			available on all the machines in the labs and can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">
				www.bluej.org </a>. There is a very good tutorial available at that web 
			site as well. I will be using BlueJ when presenting and writing code in class.

		<h2>
			Java Coding Style Rules
		</h2>
		The following are the coding style rules that we will be using for this class. 
		You may lose some points in your lab assignments if your code does not adhere 
		to these rules.
		<ul>
			<li>
			Align all curly braces vertically to allow easy visual matching.<li>
			Use four (4) spaces for each indentation.<li>
			Indent all statements contained within compound statements (if, for, while, {}, 
			etc).<li>
			Use meaningful names for variables, parameters, subprograms, and classes. (You 
			may use simple names like i, c, s, or f for general integers, characters, 
			strings, or floats respectively.)<li>
			Define and use names for all constants, e.g., PI instead of 3.14159, and 
			BUF_SIZE instead of 1024.<li>
				Use the following conventions for letter-case of identifiers:
				<table border="3">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<th>
								Identifier
							</th>
							<th>
								Convention
							</th>
							<th>
								Examples
							</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								class names
							</td>
							<td>
								capitalize first word, capitalize all other words (no underscores)</td>
							<td>
								Circle, FilledCircle, ShadedFilledCircle
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								class member names
							</td>
							<td>
								lowercase first word, capitalize all other words (no underscores)
							</td>
							<td>
								draw(), drawLine(), centerX, centerY, radius
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								function names
							</td>
							<td>
								lowercase first word, capitalize all other words (no underscores)
							</td>
							<td>
								findIndex(), factorial(), toLowerCase(), isUpperCase()
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								named constants
							</td>
							<td>
								all caps, use underscores to separate words
							</td>
							<td>
								PI, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE
							</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody></table>
			<li>
			Use whitespace around every binary operator (e.g, x + y instead of x+y) and 
			around function arguments (e.g, put( x, y ) instead of put(x,y)).<li>
			Comment each class, each method, and each class variable (describing it's 
			purpose) using a form similar to the example at the very end. (Note I only 
			commented a few members to avoid cluttering up the Class example.)<li>
				Comments should convey some additional information not immediate from the code. 
				They should not simply reiterate what is obvious from the code.
			</li>
		</ul>

			Examples of Class Definitions
		</h3>
		<pre>
     import java.awt.*;

     /*
         class Triangle defines a two dimmensional Triangle
     */

     class Triangle
     {

         // the x,y coordinates of the origin of this Triangle

         private int x, y;

         // draws this Triangle on the display

         public void draw()
         {
            // ...
         }

         // inverts this Triangle along a horizontal line

         public void flip()
         {
            // ...
         }

         // rotates this Triangle by number of degrees specified by angle

         public void rotate( int angle )
         {
            // ...
         }

     }
