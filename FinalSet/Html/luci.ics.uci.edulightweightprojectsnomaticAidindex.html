<span><b>Nomatic*Aid: Overview</b>

<p> Nomatic*Aid consists of a handheld geo-tagging photo device that enables coordination between human relief workers during, as well in the weeks and months after, crises. For an effective crisis response, spatial and temporal information about the resources (e.g. water, arable land, vaccines) and displaced people has to be collected and collated by the team of responders working on the field. The information garnered needs to be disseminated and collated by a central server, for example the headquarters of the relief agency.</p>
<p>Since a network infrastructure may not be available after a crisis, the handheld devices are expected to form a mobile ad hoc network. In practice, however, the network will be characterized by:</p> 
<li>intermittent connectivity : an end-to-end path between the source and the destination cannot be guaranteed, hence end-to-end communication protocols such as TCP will not work.</li>
<li>long or variable delays : long propagation delays between the devices or varying queuing delays on the devices lead to end-to-end path delays that frustrate protocols requiring prompt acknowledgement or data returns.</li>
<p>In light of these network characteristics, our mobile network will be built on a delay-tolerant network architecture because it provides ways of dealing with both intermittent connectivity and network delays. Such a system uses the idea of parasitic data transport by encouraging nodes to physically carry data for others when network connectivity is not available.</p> 
<p>We intend to use camera cell phones equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) to tag, store, and communicate "capsules" of context-based data. The handheld devices will serve both as data collection and storage devices as well as communication nodes. Since the devices have limited transmission range, unpredictable mobility, and limited battery power, routing algorithms that exploit these unique challenges will be designed.</p> 
<p>In addition to system design and implementation, another component of our research involves studying the impact of our system on inter-agency coordination and the ability of relief agencies to respond promptly to crises. Anecdotal evidence suggests that relief agencies are independent and averse to coordinating with other agencies. Our study will also investigate the impact of this system on field operations.</p></span>
