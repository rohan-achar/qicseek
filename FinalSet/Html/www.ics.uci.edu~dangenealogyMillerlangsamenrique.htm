Hi,

I am also researching the LANGSAM family. Have you had a chance to view my site at
www.langsam.com

I would be happy to hear from you and assist in your research in any way possible.

Thanks!

Well, you know, last June I got a name and email address for Enrique Langsam
in Buenos Aires from David Thaler.  If you can get him to respond, he may be
able to help with H2 and several other branches in that fair city.  David
said that Enrique's father and uncles (unnamed) immigrated from Galicia and
that Enrique was willing to share what he knew.  David said that there were
16 Langsams in the phone directory.  I tried reaching Enrique and he already
had my email address but no reply.  I don't know if he does English and that
may have been the problem.  His phone number is +54 11 4832-8649 and his
email address in June 2001 was quico@movi.com.ar.
