Title: A Survey of Variable-Length Integer Coding Techniques
<br>
Speaker: Kevin Wortman</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
The need often arises to encode a sequence of arbitrary integers.  It
is possible to map such a sequence to a stream of bytes and present
the result to a general purpose compression algorithm, such as gzip,
but the results are disappointing.
<p>
However, if we introduce the assumption that an integer's frequency is
approximately inversely proportional to its magnitude, it becomes
possible to encode integers efficiently.  This talk will introduce one
motivation for integer coding: the lossless compression of digitized
audio.  Then it will proceed to paraphrase a 1996 paper by Peter
Fenwick that summarizes several methods of integer coding, and
presents an experimental comparison of their effectiveness.
