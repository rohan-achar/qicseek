<h1>
Algorithms for Privacy-Preserving Data Publication
</h1>

<h2>Michael Nelson, UCI</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Many organizations publish sensitive data for the purpose of finding
trends in areas such as public health or product consumption.  In the
interest of privacy, attributes that clearly identify individuals,
such as name and Social Security number, are removed.  Nevertheless,
it has been shown that such de-identified tables can often be used to
uniquely identify individuals using a combination of attributes such
as gender, zipcode, and date of birth.
<p>
Proposed methods for preventing this type of privacy breech give rise
to many interesting theoretical problems.  This talk will survey some
of these  privacy-preserving techniques, with an emphasis on the
algorithms and analysis that they require.  This will include some
known results as well as several open problems.
