<H2> Abstract </H2>

Many software testing and analysis tools manipulate graph representations of
programs, such as abstract syntax trees or abstract semantics graphs.
Hand-crafting such tools in conventional programming languages can be
difficult, error prone, and time consuming.  Our approach is to use
application generators targeted for the domain of graph-representation-based
testing and analysis tools.  Moreover, we generate the generators themselves,
so that the development of tools based on different languages and/or
representations can also be supported better.  In this paper we report on our
experiences in developing a system called Aria that generates testing and
analysis tools based on an abstract semantics graph representation for C and
C++ called Reprise.  Aria itself was generated by the Genoa system.  We
demonstrate the utility of Aria and, thereby, the power of our approach, by
showing Aria's use in the development of a tool that derives control
dependence graphs directly from Reprise abstract semantics graphs.
