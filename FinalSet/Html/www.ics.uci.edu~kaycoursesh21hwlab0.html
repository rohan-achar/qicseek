<p><font size="2" face="Garamond">ICS H21 &bull; UC IRVINE &bull; DAVID G. KAY &bull; FALL 2009</font></p>
<p><font face="Garamond" size="6"><b>Lab Assignment 0</b></font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">This lab assignment is due at the end of lab on
  Friday, September 25.  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">The next lab assignment (Lab Assignment 1) will be available on
  the web by Friday and will be due the following Friday at the end of lab; we&#39;ll follow
  that pattern all quarter.  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(a) </b>Choose a partner for this assignment and make sure the TA knows who your partner is. Remember that you'll choose a different partner for each lab assignment, so you'll work with this partner only this Friday. All your computer-based work on this (and every) lab assignment must follow the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/pair.html">pair programming guidelines</a>. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(b)</b> It&#39;s especially important that
  you be able to receive electronic mail sent to your UCInet ID (</font><font face="Courier New"><code>you@uci.edu</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">).
    You may redirect this mail to another account of your choosing (see the
    course reference sheet), but don&#39;t let that mail go unread.  Also, be
    sure your UCInet account doesn&#39;t exceed its disk quota.  When it does, you
    won&#39;t receive official Email.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">With your partner, test this out by sending
  each other Email at your UCI addresses. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(c)</b> Locate and launch the DrScheme
  software. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Each DrScheme window has two panes:  The bottom
  half is the interactions (or transcript) window, where you can type Scheme
  expressions and see the interpreter evaluate them immediately.  To type expressions or programs you
  wish to save, you will use the top pane (the definitions window) and click &quot;Run&quot; (at the top right) to evaluate the code (this makes the code
available for use in the interactions window below).</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">The DrScheme system actually includes many
  different versions of Scheme.  We&#39;ll be using the <i>How to Design Programs</i> teaching languages, a graduated series of languages that build up to full
  Scheme step by step.  (One might wonder why it&#39;s necessary to take these
  &quot;baby steps&quot;; the answer is that by restricting the language features
  to those that a student needs at the moment, DrScheme can provide error
  messages that describe the actual problem more clearly.  Programming language
  error messages are notoriously inaccurate. The compiler is just a computer
  program, so it can&#39;t know for sure what the programmer intended when
  it finds something wrong. But with these different language levels, DrScheme
  does better than most.)  We will start with the &quot;Beginning Student&quot;
  language; if it&#39;s not the level currently installed (look for &quot;Programming language&quot;
  in the lower pane), change it in the Language menu and click Run again.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(d)</b> Experiment with DrScheme to get
  familiar with it. One person &quot;drives&quot; (types); the other &quot;navigates&quot; (observes, questions, suggests); if you don't know what this is about, go back and read the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/pair.html">pair programming guidelines</a>.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Try evaluating some expressions, like </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(*
  3 4 5)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4"> and </font><font face="Courier New">(<code>expt&#160;2
    5)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4"> and </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(gcd
      15 230)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">.  (In
        DrScheme, calculating greatest common divisors is predefined (built in)). </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Type in some definitions of symbols in the
  interactions window, like </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(define number-of-students
    31)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4"> and </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(define
      number-of-staff 2)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4"> and then try </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(+
        number-of-students number-of-staff)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">.
          </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(e)</b> The &quot;driver&quot; and &quot;navigator&quot; should switch roles now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Garamond" size="4">The factorial function (written
  in mathematical notation with an exclamation point, so &quot;<i>n</i> factorial&quot; would be <i>n</i>!)
  is used in calculating how many ways there are to arrange things (like the number of different ways to arrange five students in a row).  The value
  of <i>n</i>! is <i>n</i> * (<i>n</i>-1) * (<i>n</i>-2) * ... * 1, so 5!
  = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Type the following function definition into
  the definitions window.  Actually do the typing so you can get used to the
  way it works; don&#39;t just copy and paste.  (We&#39;ll go over the details
  of this code in class some time soon; for now, this is just a typing exercise
and you shouldn&#39;t try too hard to understand how it works. If you're not used to typing programs, be careful to type accurately.)</font></p>

<pre class="style8">
;; fact: number -&gt; number
;; Compute n! (n factorial).
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (cond
      ((&lt;= n 0)  1 )   ; 0! is 1 by definition
      (else (* n (fact (- n 1)))))))

<font face="Garamond" size="4">Notice how the environment indents and highlights blocks of code so you don&#39;t get the parentheses confused.</font></pre>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Don&#39;t forget to click Run.  Now try evaluating
  expressions like </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(fact 5)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">, </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(fact 50)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">, </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(fact 120)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">, and </font><font face="Courier New"><code>(fact 500)</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">.
      Next, evaluate</font> <font face="Courier New"><code>(fact (fact
        5))</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">.  Scheme can handle long numbers
          effortlessly, but any computer is finite; what do you think might happen
          if you evaluate</font> <font face="Courier New"><code>(fact (fact
            50))</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">?  You can try it, but you&#39;ll
              have to stop the evaluation if you don&#39;t want to wait until the machine
              finally runs out of memory.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Save a copy of the interactions window that
  shows your work for this part (using Save Other and Save Interactions as
  Text from the File menu).  A good name for the file would be <code>lab1e.scm</code>; stick with a naming pattern like this for the rest of the quarter.  It&#39;s fine if your interactions show false starts and mistakes; it&#39;s
  also fine if you just produce a short, clean copy.  Edit the file to make
  sure it includes your name and your partner&#39;s; submit this file via
  Checkmate.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(f)</b> Switch roles again.  Follow this pattern in all your lab work this quarter; we won't keep mentioning it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Garamond" size="4">Scheme represents and manipulates numbers more flexibly than most programming languages, in part because it doesn't tie what the user sees to the way the hardware stores the number.</font></p>
<p><font face="Garamond" size="4">What is the value produced by </font><tt><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><code>(/ pi 2)</code></font></tt><font face="Garamond" size="4">?
  The result is prefixed by </font><font face="Courier New"><code>#i</code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">,
    which signals &quot;inexact representation&quot;; this means that the decimal
    number may be rounded off (as the value of pi would have to be). </font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Enter this definition (you can copy and paste
it into the definitions window):</font></p>

<pre class="style8">
(define decimal-format
  (lambda (num)
    (string-&gt;number (number-&gt;string (exact-&gt;inexact num)))))
</pre>

<p><font face="Garamond" size="4">Then evaluate </font><code>(decimal-format
  (/ pi 2))</code><font face="Garamond" size="4">.  This gives you a more human-readable number, in case you need to produce polished
    results.  (There are also ways to specify the precise number of digits, but
  that&#39;s for another time.) Next,  evaluate </font><code>(/ 4 3)</code><font face="Garamond" size="4"> and </font><code>(+ 125 (/ 22 7))</code><font face="Garamond" size="4">; DrScheme indicates that the results are repeating decimals with a bar over the repeating digits. Evaluate </font><font face="Courier"><tt><code>(/
  (fact 5) (expt 7 2))</code></tt></font><font face="Garamond" size="4">; this result repeats, too, but not in a discernible pattern. Save a copy of the interactions window that shows your work for this part so far.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Now, go to the Language menu, select Choose
  Language, and click Show Details.  Then select Mixed Fraction</font><font face="Garamond"><span class="style6">s.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Garamond" size="4">  Next, evaluate again the four expressions above. These results, in fractional form, are not what we expect
    to see on a computer, but they're useful in further calculations because
    nothing is lost by rounding off to a decimal representation.  Try some other
    divisions.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4">Save a copy of the interactions window that
  shows your work for this second part, following the instructions in part <b>(e)</b> above.  Notice that the fractions in the file are saved in a slightly different form than the one DrScheme uses in the interactions window. Combine both files for this part into one, remembering to include both partners' names, and submit the file via Checkmate.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>(g)</b> Remember that each partner must
  complete a partner evaluation form and submit it individually.  Do this
  by connecting to </font><font face="Courier New"><code><a href="http://eee.uci.edu/">eee.uci.edu</a></code></font><font face="Garamond" size="4"> and choosing the Survey tool for ICS H21. Make sure you know your partner's name, first and last, so you can evaluate the right person. Please complete your evaluation
    by the end of the day on Friday, or Saturday morning at the latest.  It
    only takes a couple of minutes and not doing it hurts your participation score.</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="4" face="Garamond">What to turn in:</font></strong><font size="4" face="Garamond"> Submit via <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">Checkmate</a> the interactions (transcripts) for parts <strong>(e)</strong> and  <strong>(f)</strong> above. It would be an excellent idea to go back and re-read parts <strong>(e)</strong> and <strong>(f)</strong> carefully now, to make sure you've completed all the steps specified. Also remember that each student must complete a partner evaluation form by logging in to </font><font face="Garamond"><a href="http://eee.uci.edu/"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><code>eee.uci.edu</code></font></a></font><font size="4" face="Garamond"> and selecting the Survey tool; these evaluations contribute to your class participation score. </font></p>
