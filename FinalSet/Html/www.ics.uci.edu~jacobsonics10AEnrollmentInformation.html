<p>It takes many different resources to teach ICS 10A, including instructors, teaching assistants, classroom seats and computers. The limitation on enrollment this quarter is the number of seats is lab section; they allow for a total enrollment of 90 students. We have 43 folks enrolled as of this writing, so there is plenty of room to add students into the course.</p>

<p>We discuss below how to get in to ICS 10A, stay in, make changes, and get out; follow the directions here to minimize your hassles.</p>

<div class="section">

<h3>  To maintain your seat in lab </h3>
</div>

<p> If you are currently enrolled, you must attend your priority lab section at least once during the first two weeks of the quarter; if you do not, in the rare event your lab sections gets full and others want to add in to that section, we may give your seat to a waiting student.</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3> To add the course, or change your lab section </h3>
</div>

<p>We will add students into ICS10A through the end of the third week, that is, April 21, 2006. Simply see the TA during the lab section in which you wish to enroll; bring an Enrollment (Add/Drop/Change) card with you; the TA will enroll you. He will also drop you out of your other lab section (if you are changing sections) or add you into the lecture and discussion (if you are adding the course). If, by some strange chance, the lab section you want to add has filled up, contact the instructor.</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3> To change your grading status</h3>
</div>

<p>...to pass/not pass or back again: Obtain the instructor&#146;s signature on a change card no later than May 12, 2006. 
</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3>To drop the course</h3>
</div>
	
<p>Through April 14 ("the end of the second week"), just have your TA sign a drop card. Be sure to drop lecture, discussion and lab.</p>

<p>If you wish to drop the course after May 12 ("the end of the sixth week"), you must see the instructor and obtain the instructor&#146;s signature on a drop card; be prepared to give solid reasons why you must drop the course. Dropping the course after May 12 requires a "Dean's signature," which is provided only if you must drop because of major circumstances beyond your control. Note that doing poorly in the course, by itself, is not a sufficient reason.</p>

<p>For more information about ICS&#146; add, drop and change policies, see

<h3>Registrar Deadlines</h3>
</div>

<p>For the Registrar's Office to accept your add/drop/change card without a Dean's signature, it must be turned in to the Office no later than 5 pm on the last day it can be processed without that signature. So, an add card must be turned in by 5pm April 21, and drop and change cards by 5 pm May 12. The Registrar will typically refuse to accept your card even seconds after these deadlines! if you miss the deadline, you'll have to complete another card and obtain both the instructor's and Dean's signatures.</p>
