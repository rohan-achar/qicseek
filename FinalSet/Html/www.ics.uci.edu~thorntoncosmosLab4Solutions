<p class="title">Solutions</p>

<p>I've written the solutions to these programs using functions, similarly to how we did in lecture on Friday, July 21.  The comments in the program are written in such a way that they assume that you've read the programs in the order that they're presented here; in other words, the comments in Version 2 of Program 2 assume that you've read the comments in both versions of Program 1 and in the first version of Program 2.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Program 1: Finding candidate genes on the given strand of DNA sequences
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Program1-1.py">Version 1: Reads DNA sequences typed in by the user</a></li>
      <li><a href="Program1-2.py">Version 2: Reads DNA sequences from an AlexDNA file</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Program 2: Finding candidate genes on the given and reverse strands of DNA sequences
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Program2-1.py">Version 1: Reads DNA sequences typed in by the user</a></li>
      <li><a href="Program2-2.py">Version 2: Reads DNA sequences from an AlexDNA file</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Program 3: Finding candidate genes on the given and reverse strands of DNA sequences, including the amino acid translation of each
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Program3-1.py">Version 1: Reads DNA sequences typed in by the user</a></li>
      <li><a href="Program3-2.py">Version 2: Reads DNA sequences from an AlexDNA file</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I've provided a fixed version of the AlexDNA file from Lab 4:</p>
