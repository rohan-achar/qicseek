<h1>Three Dynamic Programs</h1>

As we saw last time, the basic idea of dynamic programming is
simple: 

<ul>
<li>Start with an inefficient recursive algorithm.</li>

<li>Speed it up by only solving each subproblem once and
remembering the solution for later use.</li>

<li>Maybe rearrange the order of subproblem computation to be more
convenient (a loop instead of a recursion).</li>
</ul>

I promised you I'd talk about regular expression matching, so we'll
start with that. I'll also describe algorithms for partitioning
sets into equal-size subsets, and for finding the optimal order of
multiplying matrices. 

<h2>Regular expressions</h2>

A regular expression is a string such as ba((na+bo)*)no. These
strings are interpreted as patterns that match longer strings,
using three basic operations: 

<ul>
<li><b>Concatenation</b>. If pattern p1 matches string s1, and p2
matches s2, then p1p2 matches s1s2. The pattern above concatenates
three subpatterns: ba, (na+bo)*, and no. In each of these patterns,
the two-letter combinations are concatenations of single
letters.</li>

<li><b>Iteration</b>. If pattern p matches string s, then pattern
p* matches any number of copies of s, all concatenated together.
"Any number" can be zero, so p* also matches the empty string.</li>

<li><b>Alternation</b>. If pattern p1 matches string s1, and p2
matches s2, then p1+p2 matches s1 or s2. In the pattern above,
(na+bo) matches either "na" or "bo", but not combinations such as
"nabo".</li>
</ul>

For instance, the pattern above matches strings bano, banano,
babono, banabobonano, etc. 

<p>The algorithms I'm going to describe test whether some string
matches a regular expression. Generally, we don't want to know that
so much as whether a substring matches. We can solve this problem
by introducing "wildcards", which I'll denote by a question mark.
So ?*ba((na+bo)*)no?*. would match any string having a substring
matching ba((na+bo)*)no.</p>

<h2>Graphs from regular expressions</h2>

Given any regular expression, there's a natural way of transforming
it into a certain kind of graph. We make a subgraph for each piece
of the expression, with one incoming and one outgoing edge. To form
the overall graph, we hook these subgraphs together in certain
ways: one after the other for concatenation, side by side for
alternation, or looping back on itself for iteration. Here's the
graph for our original pattern ba((na+bo)*)no: 

<center><img src="banabono.gif" width="509" height="167" alt=
"pattern matching graph"></center>

<p> The strings matched by the pattern then correspond exactly to
the sequences of letters you go through at the vertices of paths in
this graph. So we can think of the regular expression matching
problem as one of finding an appropriate path in the graph, one
that goes through the right vertices in the right order.</p>

<p>To apply dynamic programming, we'll start with a recursive
algorithm for this problem, that tests for a given vertex in the
graph, and a suffix of the input, whether there is a path from the
start to that vertex that matches that substring.</p>

<pre>
    recursive_match(graph,vertex,string,strlen)
    {
        for (each vertex w)
            if (recursive_match(graph, w, string, strlen-1) &amp;&amp;
                    (w -&gt; v matches string[strlen-1]))
                return TRUE;
        return FALSE;
    }
</pre>

To turn this into a dynamic program, we just remember the solutions
for each value of the vertex and strlen parameters. There are O(m)
choices of the vertex (where m denotes the length of the pattern)
and O(n) choices of strlen (where n is the length of the string to
be matched), so there are O(mn) subproblems. Each takes O(m) time
to compute (it involves a loop through each other vertex) so the
total time is O(m^2 n). 

<p>To think about how to speed this up, let's turn it into a graph
path problem as before. We'll make a new big graph; think of it as
being the cartesian product of the string with the smaller pattern
graph we already constructed. A vertex of the new graph will
correspond to pair (v,i) where v is vertex of the pattern graph and
i is index into string. We add an edge (v,i) -&gt; (w,i) if v can
get to w without processing any more characters, and an edge (v,i)
-&gt; (w,i+1) if you can get from v to w while matching the single
character string[i].</p>

<p>For instance, for the string "bano" this product graph looks
like four copies of the original pattern graph. Each copy keeps
only the edges that don't involve matching a character, and
different copies are connected by edges that depend on the
corresponding positions of the string "bano".</p>

<center><img src="bano.gif" width="487" height="731" alt=
"product of pattern graph and text"></center>

<p> The pattern matching problem then turns out to be equivalent to
reachability in this graph. Since the graph has O(mn) vertices and
edges, we can test reachability and solve the regular expression
matching problem in time O(mn).</p>

<h2>Partition problem</h2>

Suppose you have 20 files to store, with lengths measured in
megabytes. The total size is 200 MB, and you have two 100-MB
drives. 

<p>Can you fit them all onto the disks?</p>

<p>The answer is sometimes yes, sometimes no. E.g. if the file
sizes are 18x5, 1x47, 1x63 it's not possible. The two big files
can't be together because they're too big, and they can't be
separate because then neither side could be a multiple of ten. But
4x38, 16x3 is possible: put 2x38 and 8x3 on each side.</p>

<p>How to tell automatically when this problem can be solved?</p>

<p>As usual, let's start with a recursive algorithm. Given a
sequence x1,x2,x3,...xn of positive integers and a target sum T
(here n=20, T=100) then if some group of values adds to T, either
xn is in the group or it isn't. So the problem is solvable if
either the same sum is solvable for x1...x(n-1), or if T-xn is
solvable for x1...x(n-1).</p>

<pre>
    partition(X,n,T)
    {
        if (T=0) return true else
        return (partition(X,n-1,T) or partition(X,n-1,T-X[n])
    }
</pre>

As often happens, this simple recursive algorithm is very
inefficient. A problem with n values leads to two subproblems with
n-1 values, so there are 2^n recursive calls. We can make some
minor improvement if we test whether T&lt;0 and return false
immediately, but that still won't be enough to really speed up the
algorithm. 

<p>Now let's turn it into a dynamic program. As usual, we start
with the memoizing version, based on the same recursion, but
storing subproblem solutions. We store them in an array M[n,T]
contains three values: true, false, undefined. Initially all values
are assumed to be initialized to undefined.</p>

<pre>
    partition(X,n,T)
    {
        if T&lt;0 return false
        else if T=0 return true
        else if M[n,T] is undefined
            M[n,T] = partition(X,n-1,T) or partition(X,n-1,T-X[n])
        return M[n,T]
    }
</pre>

Analysis: each call takes constant time unless we fill in a new
array value. There are nT array values to fill in, each of which
involves constant time plus O(1) subroutine calls. So the total is
O(nT) time. 

<p>As usual, we can simplify this by reordering it and getting a
bottom up dynamic program:</p>

<pre>
    partition(X,n,T)
    {
        array M[n,T] of boolean values
        for i = 1 to n
        {
            M[i,0] = true
            for j = 1 to T
            {
                if (X[i] &gt; j) M[i,j] = M[i-1,j]
                else M[i,j] = M[i-1,j] or M[i-1,j-X[i]]
            }
        }
        return M[n,T]
    }
</pre>

And as in the longest common subsequence problem, reordering saves
space and simplifies the method even further: 

<pre>
    partition(X,n,T)
    {
        array M[T] of boolean
        M[0] = true
        for i = 1 to n
            for j = X[i] to T
                M[j] = M[j] or M[j-X[i]]
        return M[T]
    }
</pre>

Like the previous two dynamic programs, this can be turned into a
graph reachability problem by making one vertex per subproblems and
connecting two vertices by an edge when one depends on the other.
Let's finish by looking at a problem, matrix multiplication, that
is different: as far as I can tell it isn't related to paths in
graphs. It's also a good example of a dynamic program in which each
recursive call is more than constant time. 

<h2>Optimum matrix multiplication</h2>

Two facts you need to know about matrices: multiplying an i*j
matrix by a j*k matrix produces an i*j*k matrix and takes time
O(ijk). (Actually there are somewhat faster algorithms based on
complicated divide and conquer schemes but that doesn't affect the
rest of this section.) 

<p>Given a sequence of integers</p>

<pre>
    (x1,x2,x3,...xn)
</pre>

corresponding to matrices 

<pre>
    M[x1,x2], N[x2,x3], O[x3,x4] ...
</pre>

there are several ways to do the multiplication: 

<pre>
    (M N) O   or  M (N O)
</pre>

taking different total times: 

<pre>
    O(x1x2x3 + x1x3x4)  or  O(x1x2x4 + x2x3x4)
</pre>

What is the best way to multiply the matrices? how much time does
it take? 

<p>If there are only four integers in the sequence (and so only
three matrices) you can just compare both possibilities, but for
longer sequences there may be exponentially many different
multiplication orders to test. We'd like to find the best one
without testing them all.</p>

<p>The basic idea of the algorithm is to look at the last
multiplication you do:</p>

<pre>
    (M N O ... Q) (R S T ... Z)
</pre>

Note that the two groups should be optimally multiplied inside
themselves. So if you only knew where to split them, you could
solve the problem using two recursive subproblems. Fortunately, it
isn't allowed to reorder the matrices, so there are only O(n)
different possible splits. We simply try them all. 

<p>It's easier to understand the solution if we instead look at
list of dimensions. This is again splits into two groups,</p>

<pre>
    (x1 x2 ... xk)
    (xk x(k+1) ... xn)
</pre>

(note that the two overlap by one integer). We want to find the
optimal value of k; we can try all possible values and choose the
one that gives the best total matrix multiplication cost. 

<p>As usual, we start with a recursive procedure.</p>

<pre>
    mtime(X,i,j)
    {
        if (j&lt;=i+1) return 0;
        cost = +infinity;
        for (k = i+1; k &lt;= j-1; k++)
            cost = min(cost, mtime(X,i,k)+mtime(X,k,j)+X[i]X[j]X[k])
        return cost
    }
</pre>

This is inefficient (it takes exponential time). But there are only
O(n^2) subproblems being solved: that's how many ways there are of
choosing i and j. We can memoize by storing a solution T[i,j]: 

<pre>
    array T[n,n] = {-1, -1, ..., -1};

    mtime(X,i,j)
    {
        if (j&lt;=i+1) return 0;
        else if (T[i,j] &gt;=0) return T[i,j];
        cost = +infinity
        for (k = i+1; k &lt;= j-1; k++)
            cost = min(cost, mtime(X,i,k)+mtime(X,k,j)+X[i]X[j]X[k])
        T[i,j] = cost;
        return cost;
    }
</pre>

Each call takes constant time unless it fills in an entry. But in
that case it takes O(n) time. There are O(n^2) entries to fill in,
so the total time of this memoizing dynamic program is O(n^3). 

<p>Finally, let's write a bottom up version that computes the
answers in a simpler order. We have to be careful: it would not
work to do for(i=1 to n) for(j=1 to n). For one thing, the problem
only makes sense when j&gt;i. But also, if we did it in that order
we would need recursive values before they were computed. The whole
idea of the simpler order is not to have to test whether a value
has been computed, but instead to know because of the order that it
already has been and just look it up. Here one idea that works
pretty well is to compute in order of the difference d=j-i. So:</p>

<pre>
    mtime(X)
    {
        array T[n,n]
        for(d = 1; d &lt;= n-1; d++)
            for (i = 1; i &lt;= n-d; i++)
            {
                j=i+d
                if (j&lt;=i+1) T[i,j] = 0
                T[i,j] = +infinity
                for (k = i+1; k &lt;= j-1; k++) do
                    T[i,j] = min(T[i,j], T[i,k]+T[k,j]+X[i]X[j]X[k])
            }
        return T[1,n];
    }
</pre>

Now it's even more obvious that the total time is O(n^3): just look
at the three nested loops.
