<h1>Statistical Models for Event Detection in Count Data</h1>
<img style="float:right" src="event-1.jpg" height="150" alt="Sensor">
<p>This page contains links to code from several papers on automatic
event detection in data consisting of discrete counts, using variants
of Poisson processes to model the underlying phenomena.

<p>Data examined include (a) counts of entries and exits through one or more
doors of a UCI campus building, captured via a wireless optical sensor
(image, right; data available from the UCI ML repository); 
(b) vehicle counts collected via loop sensor data on the
I-405 freeway, collected by CalTrans (data available from CalTrans' website); 
(c) traffic accident data (date and time
of accident report) from North Carolina. 

<h2>Markov-Modulated Poisson Process</h2>
<p>Work with Padhraic Smyth and Jon Hutchins at UCI; published in
SIGKDD 2006. Matlab code available <a href="kdd06.zip">here</a>.

<p>This work describes a discrete-time model, 
in which the data are modelled as consisting of
the superposition of "normal" behavior, represented using a Poisson process,
and "event" behavior consisting of increases (or more rarely, decreases) in
the number of counts observed.  The event behavior is captured using a
Markov chain model to capture the idea of event persistence, allowing the
model to find slight but sustained changes in activity and more accurately
estimate the duration of a detected event.  An example is shown at right,
where the blue curve shows the observed counts, black the estimated normal
profile; red bars show the estimated probability of an event at each time, 
and the bottom-most panel shows a partial ground truth of known events,
held out from the model for validation purposes.
