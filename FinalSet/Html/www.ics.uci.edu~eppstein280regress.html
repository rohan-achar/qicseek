<H2>Regression</H2>

The data model for linear regression is that the data points
are constrained to lie on some hyperplane (i.e., there is a linear
relation between their coordinates).  Another way of interpreting this
is to treat one of the coordinates as "dependent" and the rest as
"independent": the dependent coordinate is then a linear function of the
independent ones.  The data may be chosen according to some probability
distribution on the line, or there may be some known pattern of
independent coordinates (e.g. they are chosen on the grid), at each
point of which one measures the dependent coordinate.
For the probability distribution models, it doesn't much matter which is
the dependent and which the independent variables (the only restriction
is that the hyperplane must not be parallel to the dependent coordinate axis).
But this choice may make a difference if the independent coordinates are
nonrandom or if the noise model adds noise only to the dependent coordinate.

<P>
Data models in which the data points must satisfy multiple linear
relations (i.e. they lie on a lower dimensional subspace) can often
be handled by treating each dependent coordinate separately,
but this is only appropriate for noise models in which the coordinates
are independent (e.g. Gaussian noise).

<H3>Projective Duality</H3>

There's another picture of regression that is mathematically equivalent
but may help human intuition.
Interpret the coordinates (a,b) defining
any line y=ax+b to instead define a point in a "dual" a-b plane.
Then the set of lines through any point (x,y) in the primal plane
turns into a set of points b=(-x)a+y in the dual plane; this set is just
a line.

<P>So if we have a collection of points (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>)
defining a regression problem, we can think of them instead as
each defining a different line b=(-x<sub>i</sub>)a+y<sub>i</sub>
in the a-b plane.  What we want to find is a point in the a-b plane
that is "near" all of these lines; that is, we expect the lines
to roughly look like they all go through a common point, and we want to
find that common point.

<P>Similar methods transform any higher dimensional regression problem
of fitting a single hyperplane to a set of data points
into an equivalent problem of fitting a single point
to an arrangement of hyperplanes.

<H3><A NAME="Lp">L<sub>p</sub> Models for Dependent Noise</A></H3>

Let's first consider the case in which the noise is a random variable
added only to the independent variable.
The most common algorithm for fitting this model is least squares:
If we are trying to find a linear model
y=m.x+b (where y is the dependent variable, x is the vector of
independent variables, and m and b are the parameters we're trying to find)
then we measure the error of fit by
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>
E = sum (m.x<sub>i</sub>+b-y<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
</DIV>
The least squares fit is the one minimizing this error estimate.

<P>
The big advantage of least squares is that it's easy to solve:
E is just a positive definite quadratic form, so it has a unique
minimum.  Since E is a smooth function of m and b, its minimum
occurs at the point where its partial derivatives in each coordinate
are all zero.  This gives a system of d equations in d unknowns
which one can solve by Gaussian elimination, or one can
instead use local improvement methods to approximate the optimal fit.
Thus the time is linear in the number of unknowns, and at worst
cubic in the dimension.

<P>
More generally the L<sub>p</sub> error is formed by using pth powers
in place of squares in the definition of E.
The limit of this, the L<sub>infinity</sub> norm, is
just the maximum error of any individual data point.
The most commonly used of these are the L<sub>1</sub> norm
(also known as "least absolute deviation" or LAD regression)
which is less sensitive to outliers than least squares,
and the L<sub>infinity</sub> norm,
which is more sensitive to outliers and therefore useful
in contexts where one wants to detect them e.g. measuring flatness of a
surface.

<P>The L<sub>infinity</sub> estimator can be expressed as a low
dimensional linear program: find (m,b,e), minimizing e,
and satisfying the linear constraints
-e&nbsp;<U>&lt;</U>&nbsp;m.x<sub>i</sub>+b-y<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;<U>&lt;</U>&nbsp;e.
The dimension (number of variables to be found) is just d+1.
Therefore, it can be solved in time linear in the number of data points
(but exponential in the dimension)
using low-dimensional linear programming techniques.
[citations to be filled in later].
There also exists a similar linear time bound for L<sub>1</sub> estimation
[<A HREF="bib.html#Z84">Z84</A>].
All L<sub>p</sub> estimators are invariant to coordinate changes
and affine transformations among only dependent variables.

<P>One advantage of assuming dependent noise is that
it is preserved by the duality transformation described above:
the vertical distance of a point (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>)
from the line y=ax+b is the same as the vertical distance
of the point (a,b) from the line
b=(-x<sub>i</sub>)a+y<sub>i</sub>.
(Just work out the equations, they're the same!)

<P>In the discussion, one of the students suggested using a convex combination
of different L<sub>p</sub> metrics, which might e.g. come from a truncated
power series for some harder-to-estimate metric.  Alternatively, the
coefficients in the convex combination might themselves come
from some sort of statistical estimation, to fit the noise
actually apparent in the data.  However, I don't know of any references
related to these ideas.

<H3><A NAME="tls">L<sub>p</sub> Models for Independent Noise</A></H3>

If the noise is added to all coordinates (not just the dependent ones)
it may be appropriate to use the Euclidean distance from the regression
hyperplane in place of the vertical distance m.x+b-y used above.
Alternatively, the same considerations as in
<A HREF="point.html#dist">single point estimation</A>
may make a different distance function appropriate.

L<sub>2</sub> estimation with Euclidean distance is known as "total least
squares"
[<A HREF="bib.html#GL80">GL80</A>,
[<A HREF="bib.html#M59">M59</A>,
[<A HREF="bib.html#P01">P01</A>].
The optimal estimator must go through the centroid of the
data (this is not too hard to see if one applies duality) but the
algebra describing the estimator quality as a function of its parameters
is messy and hard to invert.  However, the problem can
apparently be solved by singular value decomposition.

<P>There's a nice connection between L<sub>1</sub> estimation in the
independent noise model
and the famous "k-sets" or "k-level" problem from computational
geometry: if you fix a choice of slope, the problem is just a
one-dimensional L<sub>1</sub> problem which can be solved by the median.
If we use projective duality,
what we want to know is the median among the points where the dual
hyperplanes cross each possible vertical line;
this sequence of medians forms a surface in the arrangement and is known
as the "k-level" (here k=n/2).  In two dimensions, this surface is just
a polygonal path, formed by walking left-to-right through the
arrangement and turning up or down at every crossing point you pass through.
A famous problem posed by Erd&ouml;s
and Lov&aacute;sz is on the number of edges this path can have;
known bounds are Omega(n&nbsp;log&nbsp;k) and O(nk<sup>1/3</sup>).

<P>L<sub>infinity</sub> estimation is equivalent to computing the width of
a set (minimum distance between parallel supporting hyperplanes);
it can be computed in O(n log n) time in the plane, but the best time
known in three dimensions is O(n<sup>3/2</sup>) [citations to be filled
in later].

<P>These independent noise estimators are generally invariant
under arbitrary translations or rotations of the coordinate system,
however they are not invariant to general affine transformations.

<H3>Dual-Independent Noise</H3>

If one has in mind some physical meaning to the dual interpretation,
in which the data define lines and the estimator one is trying to find
is a point near all these lines, then it may make sense to use Euclidean
distance in the dual plane instead of the primal.
I.e., we define the distance from the estimator point (a,b)
to a data line b=(-x<sub>i</sub>)a+y<sub>i</sub>.
to be the usual Euclidean distance of that point from that line.

<P>With that definition, one can make any sort of L<sub>p</sub>
regression etc.  The L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and
L<sub>infinity</sub> regressions can all be solved easily using
simple modifications of the algorithms for dependent noise models.
(This is one big advantage of dual independence over primal independence.)

<P>I don't know of any references, or work by actual statisticians,
on this sort of model.

<H3><A NAME="LMS">Least Median of Squares</A></H3>

The LMS estimator, defined by Rousseeuw
[<A HREF="bib.html#R84">R84</A>],
minimizes the median error (rather than the sum of errors or squared
errors as in L<sub>1</sub> or L<sub>2</sub> estimation).
Equivalently, we seek a planar strip of minimum possible
vertical width that covers at least half the data points.

<P>It is commonly claimed that
this estimator provides the maximum possible robustness to outliers
-- up to half the data may be arbitrarily corrupted.
This claim seems to rely on an assumption that the data
is well spread out along the independent coordinates,
rather than being tightly clustered along lower dimensional subspaces in
a way that would
allow an adversary to set up false estimates using large
numbers of valid data points.
But the same assumption must be made for any other robust regression method.

<P>
Unfortunately algorithms for computing the LMS estimator are relatively slow:
O(n<sup>2</sup>) even in two dimensions
[<A HREF="bib.html#SS87">SS87</A>,
<A HREF="bib.html#ES90">ES90</A>].
There are theoretical reasons for believing that no exact
algorithm can be faster than this.
However Mount et al
[<A HREF="bib.html#MNRSW97">MNRSW97</A>]
provide an O(n log n) time approximation as well as
a randomized algorithm that they believe should work well in practice
(although it lacks theoretical performance guarantees).

<P>In the dual framework, we are given an arrangement of lines,
and we wish to find the shortest possible vertical line segment
that crosses at least half of the lines.

<P>This estimator assumes a dependent noise model;
one can define LMS-like estimator in similar ways for
independent noise (in which case one is trying to find 
a line minimizing the median distance to the points)
or for dual-independent noise
(in which case one is trying to find a minimum-radius circle
that crosses at least half of the lines).

<H3><A NAME="repmed">Repeated Median</A></H3>

I don't know what this is, but it's the subject of
[<A HREF="bib.html#MMN98">MMN98</A>].

<P>Here's my guess, based on the name -- I haven't looked the paper
itself up yet.  LMS estimation can be interpreted as finding a set of
outliers to throw away and ignore (namely the points further away
than the median distance it finds).  But once it throws away those
points, it then does something fairly stupid with the rest of the points:
just the L<sub>infinity</sub> estimator, which is very sensitive to outliers.
So if the data that's left after throwing away half the points is still
suspect, it seems more reasonable to instead apply the same outlier
detection strategy recursively.

<P>There's not much to say about algorithms for this, at least not
without more progress on algorithms for the LMS estimator.
The reason is that if you have a quadratic algorithm for LMS,
and apply it recursively as above, you can describe the recursion's time
by the recurrence T(n)=T(n/2)+O(n<sup>2</sup>) which is again quadratic.
So asymptotically, the time for this recursive approach would be the
same as the time for simple LMS estimation.

<H3><A NAME="medslope">Median Slope</A></H3>

The so-called Thiel-Sen estimator (for planar data only) finds
a line y=mx+b
by choosing m
to be the median among the n(n-1)/2 slopes of lines determined
by pairs of data points.  The remaining parameter b can then be
found by choosing the median among the values y-mx.

<P>In the dual framework, we are given an arrangement of lines
in the a-b plane.  Each pair of lines determines a point where
the two lines cross; we wish to find the median a-coordinate
among these (n&nbsp;choose&nbsp;2) crossings points.

<P>This method is only robust to n(1-1/sqrt(2)) ~ 0.29n outliers rather
than n/2 for the
LMS estimator (proof: if there are n/sqrt(2) valid data points, they define
roughly n^2/4 slopes, too many for the outliers to perturb the median).
However, it can be computed more quickly: O(n log n) time by
any of several algorithms
[<A HREF="bib.html#BC98">BC98</A>,
<A HREF="bib.html#CSSS89">CSSS89</A>,
<A HREF="bib.html#DMN92">DMN92</A>,
<A HREF="bib.html#KS93">KS93</A>,
<A HREF="bib.html#M91b">M91b</A>].

<P>I guess in higher dimensions one could apply any robust single point
estimation technique (e.g. centerpoint or least median of squares) to
the normal vectors to hyperplanes defined by d-tuples of points.
But I don't know of any work on such generalizations.

<H3><A NAME="depth">Regression Depth</A></H3>

A "nonfit" (in the context of dependent-noise regression) is defined to
be a vertical hyperplane; these are bad because they can't be used to
predict the values of the dependent variable.  Rousseeuw and Hubert [<A
HREF="bib.html#RH99">HR99</A>] define the "depth" of a hyperplane to be
the minimum number of points it must cross on any continuous motion that
moves it to a nonfit.  It doesn't make any difference if you restrict
the class of continuous motions to be rotations around some lower
dimensional axis.  Equivalently, one can say that a plane
partitions the data into two subsets; the depth is the 
minimum number of points that would have to change from one subset to
the other to get a partition achievable by a vertical hyperplane.
The depth of a plane is a lower bound on the number
of outliers that would have to have occurred to make that plane
inaccurate.

<P>The dual version of this is much easier to understand.
The depth of a point in an arrangement is just the minimum
number of lines (or hyperplanes) that you would need to cross
to get from the point out to infinity.  A good fit according
to this measure is then just a point with high depth;
that is, one that's enclosed by a large number of hyperplanes
in every possible direction.

<P>In one dimension, a hyperplane is just a point, a vertical hyperplane
is just a point at infinity, and so the median of a point set
gives optimal depth n/2.
In two dimensions, a very simple construction, the "catline"
[<A HREF="bib.html#HR98">HR98</A>] has depth n/3.
This is optimal, since one can find sets of points for which
no line is better than n/3.
It turns out that any point set in any dimension has a hyperplane of depth
at least n/(d+1), exactly matching the quality bounds known for centerpoints
[<A HREF="bib.html#ABET98">ABET98</A>].
However the proof is nonconstructive.

<P>Just as with the centerpoint, you probably want the deepest possible
plane not just any deep plane.  This can be found efficiently in the
plane
[<A HREF="bib.html#KMRSSS99">KMRSSS99</A>]
and less efficiently in higher dimensions.
One can also efficiently approximate the deepest plane
in linear time in any dimension using
<A HREF="cluster.html#eps">geometric sampling</A> techniques
[<A HREF="bib.html#SW98">SW98</A>].

<P>Because (the primal formulation of) this estimator depends on a definition
of a vertical direction, it makes sense for the dependent or dual-independent
noise models but not for independent noise.
It is invariant under affine transformations among only
independent variables, arbitrary affine transformations of the dual space,
or more generally any continuous deformation of space that
doesn't ever flatten a tetrahedron (produce d+1 coplanar points) or make
a vertical triangle (d points forming a vertical plane).
