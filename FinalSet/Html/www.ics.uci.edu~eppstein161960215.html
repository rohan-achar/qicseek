<h1>Breadth first search and depth first search</h1>

<h2>Traversal of graphs and digraphs</h2>

To traverse means to visit the vertices in some systematic order.
You should be familiar with various traversal methods for trees: 

<blockquote>preorder: visit each node before its children.<br>
postorder: visit each node after its children.<br>
inorder (for binary trees only): visit left subtree, node, right
subtree.</blockquote>

<p>We also saw another kind of traversal, <a href=
"960208.html#topo">topological ordering</a>, when I talked about
shortest paths.</p>

<p>Today, we'll see two other traversals: breadth first search
(BFS) and depth first search (DFS). Both of these construct
spanning trees with certain properties useful in other graph
algorithms. We'll start by describing them in undirected graphs,
but they are both also very useful for directed graphs.</p>

<h2>Breadth First Search</h2>

This can be throught of as being like Dijkstra's algorithm for
shortest paths, but with every edge having the same length. However
it is a lot simpler and doesn't need any data structures. We just
keep a tree (the breadth first search tree), a list of nodes to be
added to the tree, and markings (Boolean variables) on the vertices
to tell whether they are in the tree or list. 

<p><b>breadth first search:</b></p>

<pre>
    unmark all vertices
    choose some starting vertex x
    mark x
    list L = x
    tree T = x
    while L nonempty
    choose some vertex v from front of list
    visit v
    for each unmarked neighbor w
        mark w
        add it to end of list
        add edge vw to T
</pre>

It's very important that you remove vertices from the other end of
the list than the one you add them to, so that the list acts as a
queue (fifo storage) rather than a stack (lifo). The "visit v" step
would be filled out later depending on what you are using BFS for,
just like the tree traversals usually involve doing something at
each vertex that is not specified as part of the basic algorithm.
If a vertex has several unmarked neighbors, it would be equally
correct to visit them in any order. Probably the easiest method to
implement would be simply to visit them in the order the adjacency
list for v is stored in. 

<p>Let's prove some basic facts about this algorithm. First, each
vertex is clearly marked at most once, added to the list at most
once (since that happens only when it's marked), and therefore
removed from the list at most once. Since the time to process a
vertex is proportional to the length of its adjacency list, the
total time for the whole algorithm is O(m).</p>

<p><a name="bfstree">Next, let's look at the tree T constructed by
the algorithm. Why is it a tree? If you think of each edge vw as
pointing "upward" from w to v, then each edge points from a vertex
visited later to one visited earlier. Following successive edges
upwards can only get stopped at x (which has no edge going upward
from it) so every vertex in T has a path to x. This means that T is
at least a connected subgraph of G. Now let's prove that it's a
tree. A tree is just a connected and acyclic graph, so we need only
to show that T has no cycles. In any cycle, no matter how you
orient the edges so that one direction is "upward" and the other
"downward", there is always a "bottom" vertex having two upward
edges out of it. But in T, each vertex has at most one upward edge,
so T can have no cycles. Therefore T really is a tree. It is known
as a <i>breadth first search tree</i>.</a></p>

<p>We also want to know that T is a <i>spanning tree</i>, i.e. that
if the graph is connected (every vertex has some path to the root
x) then every vertex will occur somewhere in T. We can prove this
by induction on the length of the shortest path to x. If v has a
path of length k, starting v-w-...-x, then w has a path of length
k-1, and by induction would be included in T. But then when we
visited w we would have seen edge vw, and if v were not already in
the tree it would have been added.</p>

<p>Breadth first traversal of G corresponds to some kind of tree
traversal on T. But it isn't preorder, postorder, or even inorder
traversal. Instead, the traversal goes a <i>level</i> at a time,
left to right within a level (where a level is defined simply in
terms of distance from the root of the tree). For instance, the
following tree is drawn with vertices numbered in an order that
might be followed by breadth first search:</p>

<pre>
        1
      / | \
    2   3   4
      /   \     |
    5       6   7
    |     / | \
    8    9 10 11
</pre>

The proof that vertices are in this order by breadth first search
goes by induction on the level number. By the induction hypothesis,
BFS lists all vertices at level k-1 before those at level k.
Therefore it will place into L all vertices at level k before all
those of level k+1, and therefore so list those of level k before
those of level k+1. (This really is a proof even though it sounds
like circular reasoning.) 

<p>Breadth first search trees have a nice property: Every edge of G
can be classified into one of three groups. Some edges are in T
themselves. Some connect two vertices at the same level of T. And
the remaining ones connect two vertices on two adjacent levels. It
is not possible for an edge to skip a level.</p>

<p>Therefore, the breadth first search tree really is a shortest
path tree starting from its root. Every vertex has a path to the
root, with path length equal to its level (just follow the tree
itself), and no path can skip a level so this really is a shortest
path.</p>

<p><a name="match">Breadth first search has several uses in other
graph algorithms, but most are too complicated to explain in detail
here. One is as part of an algorithm for <i>matching</i>, which is
a problem in which you want to pair up the n vertices of a graph by
n/2 edges. If you have a partial matching, pairing up only some of
the vertices, you can extend it by finding an <i>alternating
path</i> connecting two unmatched vertices; this is a path in which
every other edge is part of the partial matching. If you remove
those edges in the path from the matching, and add the other path
edges back into the matching, you get a matching with one more
edge. Alternating paths can be found using a version of breadth
first search.</a></p>

<p><a name="sgi">A second use of breadth first search arises in
certain pattern matching problems. For instance, if you're looking
for a small subgraph such as a triangle as part of a larger graph,
you know that every vertex in the triangle has to be connected by
an edge to every other vertex. Since no edge can skip levels in the
BFS tree, you can divide the problem into subproblems, in which you
look for the triangle in pairs of adjacent levels of the tree. This
sort of problem, in which you look for a small graph as part of a
larger one, is known as <i>subgraph isomorphism</i>. In <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-psgi">a recent paper</a>,
I used this idea to solve many similar pattern-matching problems in
linear time.</a></p>

<h2>Depth first search</h2>

Depth first search is another way of traversing graphs, which is
closely related to preorder traversal of a tree. Recall that
preorder traversal simply visits each node before its children. It
is most easy to program as a recursive routine: 

<pre>
    preorder(node v)
    {
    visit(v);
    for each child w of v
        preorder(w);
    }
</pre>

To turn this into a graph traversal algorithm, we basically replace
"child" by "neighbor". But to prevent infinite loops, we only want
to visit each vertex once. Just like in BFS we can use marks to
keep track of the vertices that have already been visited, and not
visit them again. Also, just like in BFS, we can use this search to
build a spanning tree with certain useful properties. 

<pre>
    dfs(vertex v)
    {
    visit(v);
    for each neighbor w of v
        if w is unvisited
        {
        dfs(w);
        add edge vw to tree T
        }
    }
</pre>

The overall depth first search algorithm then simply initializes a
set of markers so we can tell which vertices are visited, chooses a
starting vertex x, initializes tree T to x, and calls dfs(x). Just
like in breadth first search, if a vertex has several neighbors it
would be equally correct to go through them in any order. I didn't
simply say "for each unvisited neighbor of v" because it is very
important to delay the test for whether a vertex is visited until
the recursive calls for previous neighbors are finished. 

<p><a name="dfstree">The proof that this produces a spanning tree
(the <i>depth first search tree</i>) is essentially the same as
that for BFS, so I won't repeat it. However while the BFS tree is
typically "short and bushy", the DFS tree is typically "long and
stringy".</a></p>

<p>Just like we did for BFS, we can use DFS to classify the edges
of G into types. Either an edge vw is in the DFS tree itself, v is
an ancestor of w, or w is an ancestor of v. (These last two cases
should be thought of as a single type, since they only differ by
what order we look at the vertices in.) What this means is that if
v and w are in different subtrees of v, we can't have an edge from
v to w. This is because if such an edge existed and (say) v were
visited first, then the only way we would avoid adding vw to the
DFS tree would be if w were visited during one of the recursive
calls from v, but then v would be an ancestor of w.</p>

<p>As an example of why this property might be useful, let's prove
the following fact: in any graph G, either G has some path of
length at least k. or G has O(kn) edges.</p>

<p>Proof: look at the longest path in the DFS tree. If it has
length at least k, we're done. Otherwise, since each edge connects
an ancestor and a descendant, we can bound the number of edges by
counting the total number of ancestors of each descendant, but if
the longest path is shorter than k, each descendant has at most k-1
ancestors. So there can be at most (k-1)n edges.</p>

<p>This fact can be used as part of an algorithm for finding long
paths in G, another subgraph isomorphism problem closely related to
the traveling salesman problem. If k is a small constant (like say
5) you can find paths of length k in linear time (measured as a
function of n). But measured as a function of k, the time is
exponential, which isn't surprising because this problem is closely
related to the <a href="960206.html#tsp">traveling salesman
problem</a>. For more on this particular problem, see Michael R.
Fellows and Michael A. Langston, "On search, decision and the
efficiency of polynomial-time algorithms", 21st ACM Symp. Theory of
Computing, 1989, pp. 501-512.</p>

<h2>Relation between BFS and DFS</h2>

It may not be clear from the pseudo-code above, but BFS and DFS are
very closely related to each other. (In fact in class I tried to
describe a search in which I modified the "add to end of list" line
in the BFS pseudocode to "add to start of list" but the resulting
traversal algorithm was not the same as DFS.) 

<p>With a little care it is possible to make BFS and DFS look
almost the same as each other (as similar as, say, <a href= 
"960206.html#prim">Prim's</a> and <a href="960208.html#dijkstra">
Dijkstra's</a> algorithms are to each other):</p>

<pre>
    bfs(G)
    {
    list L = empty
    tree T = empty
    choose a starting vertex x
    search(x)
    while(L nonempty)
        remove edge (v,w) from start of L
        if w not yet visited
        {
        add (v,w) to T
        search(w)
        }
    }

    dfs(G)
    {
    list L = empty
    tree T = empty
    choose a starting vertex x
    search(x)
    while(L nonempty)
        remove edge (v,w) from end of L
        if w not yet visited
        {
        add (v,w) to T
        search(w)
        }
    }

    search(vertex v)
    {
    visit(v);
    for each edge (v,w)
        add edge (v,w) to end of L
    }
</pre>

<a name="stack">Both of these search algorithms now keep a list of
edges to explore; the only difference between the two is that,
while both algorithms adds items to the end of L, BFS removes them
from the beginning, which results in maintaining the list as a
queue, while DFS removes them from the end, maintaining the list as
a stack.</a> 

<h2>BFS and DFS in directed graphs</h2>

Although we have discussed them for undirected graphs, the same
search routines work essentially unmodified for directed graphs.
The only difference is that when exploring a vertex v, we only want
to look at edges (v,w) going out of v; we ignore the other edges
coming into v. 

<p>For directed graphs, too, we can prove nice properties of the
BFS and DFS tree that help to classify the edges of the graph. For
BFS in directed graphs, each edge of the graph either connects two
vertices at the same level, goes down exactly one level, or goes up
any number of levels. For DFS, each edge either connects an
ancestor to a descendant, a descendant to an ancestor, or one node
to a node in a previously visited subtree. It is not possible to
get "forward edges" connecting a node to a subtree visited later
than that node. We'll use this property next time to test if a
directed graph is strongly connected (every vertex can reach every
other one).</p>
