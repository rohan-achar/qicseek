<P>Scot listed about twenty fields in which Voronoi diagrams are in
common use (although often not by that name).  

<UL>

<P><LI>Anthropology and Archeology -- Identify the parts of a region under
the influence of different neolithic clans, chiefdoms, ceremonial
centers, or hill forts.

<P><LI>Astronomy -- Identify clusters of stars and clusters of galaxies
(Here we saw what may be the earliest picture of a Voronoi diagram,
drawn by Descartes in 1644, where the regions described the regions
of gravitational influence of the sun and other stars.) 

<P><LI>Biology, Ecology, Forestry -- Model and analyze plant competition
("Area potentially available to a tree", "Plant polygons")

</UL>

<P>In addition to all these "real world" applications, Voronoi diagrams
have several applications within the field of computer science, in
particular, computational geometry.

<P><UL>

<P><LI>Knuth's Post Office Problem -- Given a set of locations for post
offices, how do you determine the closest post office to a given
house?  (Apparently, Knuth was ignoring the existence of ZIP codes.)

<P><LI>Closest Pair -- Given a set of points, which two are closest
together?

<P><LI>Fixed Radius Near Neighbors -- Find all pairs of points closer than
a given distance apart.

<P><LI>All k Nearest Neighbors -- Find each point's k closest neighbors

<P><LI>Enumerating interpoint distances in increasing order -- Find the
closest pair, then the next closest pair, then the next closest
pair, and so on.

</UL>

<P>[A quick search through recent computational geometry literature finds
about 300 papers, almost all published in the last decade, with either
"Voronoi" or "Delaunay" in the title.  Over a third of those papers
were published since 1990.]

<P><CENTER><H3><HR>Voronoi Diagrams -- Definitions and Examples<HR></H3></CENTER>
</A>

<P>A Voronoi diagram of a set of "sites" (points) is a collection of
regions that divide up the plane.  Each region corresponds to one of
the sites, and all the points in one region are closer to the
corresponding site than to any other site.

<P>All of the Voronoi regions are convex polygons.  Some of them are
infinite -- these correspond to the sites on the convex hull.  The
boundary between two adjacent regions is a line segment, and the line
that contains it is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining
the two sites.  Usually, Voronoi regions meet three at at time at
Voronoi points.  If three sites determine Voronoi regions that meet at
a Voronoi point, the circle through those three sites is centered at
that Voronoi point, and there are no other sites in the circle.

<P>So how would this be useful for solving, say Knuth's Post Office
Problem?  Suppose we had the Voronoi diagram of the post office
locations.  Then the find the closest post office to a given house,
all we need to do is figure out which Voronoi region the house is in.
This is an example of the "point location" problem.

<P>Once we have the Voronoi diagram, we can solve the post office problem
as follows.  (This is not the best solution, but it's reasonably
simple.)  Draw a vertical line through each of the Voronoi points.
These lines split the plane into vertical slabs.  To locate a point p,
first do a binary search to find the slab containing p.  Within each
slab, there are no Voronoi points, so the Voronoi edges that cross
each slab do so nicely.  To find the Voronoi region containing p, we
just do another binary search, this time on the spaces between the
Voronoi edges in our slab.  Altogether, the search takes O(log n)
steps, where n is the number of sites.

<P>Now let's look at the toxic waste dump problem.  You are given n
points in the plane, representing cities, and you want to put a toxic
waste dump as far from the cities as possible.  Obviously, the best
solution is to put the dump far away from ALL the points, but to make
the problem interesting, let's suppose we have to put the dump inside
the convex hull of the points.  With this contraint, the best place to
put the waste dump is either (1) on a Voronoi vertex, or (2) on the
midpoint of a convex hull edge, which must be on a Voronoi edge.


<A NAME="dt">
<P><CENTER><H3><HR>Delaunay Triangulations<HR></H3></CENTER>
</A>

<P>The Delaunay triangulation is the dual of the Voronoi diagram.  To
build the Delaunay triangulation, draw a line segment between any two
sites whose Voronoi regions share an edge.  This procedure splits the
convex hull of the sites into triangles.

<P>The Delaunay triangulation has a number of nice properties.  For
example, each point is connected to its nearest neighbor by an edge in
the triangulation.  Since the Delaunay triangulation is a planar
graph, it has at most 3n-6 edges, where n is the number of sites.  So
once you have the Dealunay triangulation, if you want to find the
closest pair of sites, you only have to look at 3n-6 pairs, instead of
all n(n-1)/2 possible pairs.

<P>Here are some nice properties of the Delaunay triangulation:

<P><UL>

<P><LI>It's dual to the Voronoi diagram, so computing one automatically
gives you the other.

<P><LI>The Empty Circle Property -- If you draw a circle through the
vertices of ANY Delaunay triangle, no other sites will be inside
that circle.

<P><LI>It's a planar graph.  By Euler's formula, it has at most 3n-6 edges
and at most 2n-5 triangles.  This property can be used to reduce
many problems with quadratic size (like closest pair) down to linear
size in the time it takes to construct the triangulation.

<P><LI>It contains "fat" triangles, in the sense that the minimum angle of
any Delaunay triangle is as large as possible.  In fact, if you
write down the list of all angles in the Delaunay triangulation, in
increasing order, then do the same thing for any other triangulation
of the same set of points, the Delaunay list is guaranteed to be
lexicographically smaller.

<A NAME="var">
<P><CENTER><H3><HR>Variations on Voronoi Diagrams<HR></H3></CENTER>
</A>

<P>One way of getting Voronoi diagrams is by growing crystals.  If you
start a number of crystals, all growing at the same rate, and all
starting at the same time, you get a number of growing circles.  As
these circles meet, straight line boundaries appear between them.
Eventually, the entire plane will be filled up.  Each crystal will
exactly fill up the Voronoi region of its point of origin.

<P>This is a little too simple.  In reality, crystals start growing at
different times.  Even if they still grow at the same rate, if they
start at different times, they will no longer meet in straight lines.
Instead, they will meet in hyperbolic segments.  The diagram you get
is called the "additively weighted Voronoi diagram".  It's defined
just like the usual Voronoi diagram, but each site has a weight, and
you measure distance to a site, you add its weight to the usual
Euclidean distance.

<P>Now suppose instead that all the crystals start at the same time, but
grow at different rates.  Now you get what's called the
"multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram".  Once again, each site is
given a weight, but when you measure the distance to a site, you
<I>multiply</I> by its weight.  Now the boundaries between different regions
are segments of circles.

<P>This model still has some problems.  For example, in a multiplic-
atively weighted Voronoi diagram, it's possible for a region to be
disconnected.  Obviously, this can't happen with real crystals.  So
there's yat another version which treats existing crystals as
obstacles, and lets fast-growing crstals grow around the slower ones.
Now the boundaries between neighboring regions are sort of
tear-shaped.  This variation is called the "multiplicatively weighted
crystal growth Voronoi diagram."

<P>There are several other variations.  You can change the metric from
the normal Euclidean distance to L<sub>1</sub>, or L<sub>p</sub>, or
L<sub>infinity</sub>, or even stranger distance functions.  You can
weight the sites additively <I>and</I> mulitplicatively.  You can change the
sites from points to line segments or circles or polygons.  You can
generalize to higher dimensions.  You can associate points with the
farthest site, instead of their nearest site.  And so on.

<P>Different applications of Voronoi diagrams require different
variations.  For example, motion planning algorithims for circular
robots often use the Voronoi diagram of the obstacles.  If there is a
path from one location to another, then there must be a path that
follows the edges of the Voronoi diagram, since those edges are by
definition as far from the obstacles as possible.

<A NAME="alg">
<P><CENTER><H3><HR>Algorithms for Computing Voronoi Diagrams<HR></H3></CENTER>
</A>

<P>There are literally hundreds of different algorithms for constructing
various types of Voronoi diagrams.  I will describe two of the
simplest.

<P>The first algorithm inserts the points one at a time into the diagram.
Whenever a new point comes in, we need to do three things.  First, we
need to figure out which of the existing Voronoi cells contains the
new site.  Second, we need to "walk around" the boundary of the new
site's Voronoi region, inserting new edges into the diagram.  Finally,
we delete all the old edges sticking into the new region.

<P>The second and third steps are the harder ones.  It's possible that
each new site's Voronoi cell will touch all the old cells.  Thus, in
the worst case, we end up spending linear time on each cell, or
O(n<sup>2</sup>)
time overall.  However, it has been proven that if you insert the
points in random order, the expected time is only O(n log n),
regardless of which set of points we're given.

A divide and conquer algorithm for constructing Voronoi diagrams was
discovered by Shamos and Hoey.  Split the points into two halves, the
leftmost n/2 points, which we'll color bLue, and the rightmost n/2
points, which we'll color Red.  Recursively compute the Voronio
diagram of the two halves.  Finally, merge the two diagrams by finding
the edges that separate the bLue points from the Red points

The last step can be done in linear time by the "walking ant" method.
An ant starts down at -infinity, walking upward along the path halfway
between some blue point and some red point.  The ant wants to walk all
the way up to +infinity, staying as far away from the points as
possible.  Whenever the ant gets to a red Voronoi edge, it turns away
from the new red point.  Whenever it hits a blue edge, it turns away
from the new blue point.

There are a few surprisingly difficult details left to deal with, like
how does the ant know where to start, and how do you know which edge
the ant will hit next.  (The interested reader is strongly encouraged
to consult the standard computational geometry literature for
solutions to these details.)
