<H1>ICS 1C: Lab Assignment 3 Grading Notes and Details</H1>

<H2>This document assumes you are familiar with the
<A HREF="../doc/assignment-3.html">original assignment</A>
including the requirements for the assignment and the criteria
stated in that assignment.</H2>
<p>
The <A HREF="hist.html">histogram of scores</A> the
<A HREF="fnl.submit.html">documents submitted by students</A>
are also available for consultation.
<hr>
Here are some notes on how Assignment 3 was scored.  Please don't
hesitate to send me e-mail or ask me in lab if you have any questions.<br>
-- Dan.
<p>
General note on scoring: I used a 24 point scale (actually, 
<A HREF=#23>23, see explanation below)</A>
and (for the most part)
no fractional scores.  But the homework only counts for 12 points, so the
score on your paper was divided in two and rounded up, if necessary, to
reach the actual score.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME=H2>
Note also that credit for simply coming up with 5 questions was previously
given at the time the questions were submitted.</A>
This amounted to
a maximum of 3 points, and is recorded separately as ``H2''
on the score sheet accessed through the
<A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/doc/ics1c/X/Grades.html">
ICS 1C Student Score Request Form</A> which lists indivduals' scores
on this second part of Assignment 3 under the column headed ``H3.''
<P>
Thus, the total score on Assignment 3 is the sum of what was
received on the first part (``H2,'' maximum of 3) and the second
part (``H3,'' maximum of 11.5 rounded up).
<p>

<HR>
<A NAME=23><b>Links: 1 point</b></A> <br>
This one didn't turn out the way it should, so everyone got 0 points.
So consider your score to really be on a 23 point scale.
<HR>

<b>Presentation: 3 points</b><br>
<A NAME="A1"> Full</A>
credit for completely modifying the original skeleton (eg. removing "About
QQ Skeletion"), correct spelling, 
careful proofreading, and having hypertext links
that were well integrated into the answers.  That is, you should not ask the
user to <A HREF="#A1"> click here</A> or to click on on <A HREF="#A1"> this</A>.

<HR>

<b>Name, e-mail address, major: 2 points</b>
Everyone got these points, except for one or two students who
forgot to modify the skeleton.

<HR>

<b>3 Finds: 3 points</b>
Points off for forgetting the links or forgetting the brief statement
explaining the find.

<HR>

<b>5 questions and answers: 3 points each, 15 points total</b><br>
The goal was to have interesting, well-focused questions and correct,
specific answers.
(<i>Credit for simply submitting questions was <A HREF=#H2>given
previously</A>.</i>)


On many printouts I wrote:
<UL>
<LI>   "vague" -- wanders around the answer, isn't precise and focused,
              includes information unrelated to the question.
<LI>   "doesn't answer the question" -- I was surprised that many people
              had questions and answers that didn't quite fit together.
              For example, if the question is "What is an X" then the
              answer shouldn't just be a link telling me where to find
              the answer.
<LI>   "could answer before" -- points off for anything that you could 
              easily find in a dictionary or in 5 minutes in the 
              library's reference room.
</UL>
I also looked for URLs that were reasonly closely related to the
question.
<P>
There is inevitably some subjectivity in this part of the scoring.
In general I was pretty quick to take off the first point and pretty
slow to take off the second or third.  This is reflected in the 
class average of 17 for the assignment: most people got 9's and 10's
(out of 15) on the question and answer part.
<HR>

<b>2 questions related to major and course: -1 or -2 points if missed</b><br>
One or two points off if 2 questions weren't related to the course content
and 2 related to your major.  
(My shorthand for this was often "-1 Major".)
And I didn't consider "Where should
I go to law school" as related to anybody's major.
