<P>

A Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a reference model of best practices for 
an engineering discipline. A project or organization can compare their 
practices against a CMM to measure how mature their processes are, to 
benchmark against competitors, and to identify improvement opportunities. 
The Software CMM (SW-CMM), and its five level scale, has become a de facto 
standard for assessing and improving software processes throughout the world.

<p>

The success of the SW-CMM was soon copied by other disciplines, and has led 
to a world of CMMs. There are currently over 30 different CMMs in use 
throughout industry, covering a variety of disciplines, and reflecting an 
assortment of structures and formats. This diversification is causing 
increasing difficulty for developers and customers in selecting and applying 
the right model(s).

<p>

This talk presents an overview of the major CMMs in use today, and the status 
of the DoD CMM integration effort. It will include comparisons of the:

<ul><li>        Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM)
<li>	Systems Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SE-CMM)
<li> 	Integrated Product Development Capability Maturity Model (IPD-CMM)
<li> 	System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM)
<li> 	Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model (SA-CMM)
<li> 	People Capability Maturity Model (P-CMM)
</li></ul>

<p>

Relationships to non-CMM standards, such as ISO 9000/9001, DoD-STD-2167A, 
MIL-STD-498, ISO 12207, and IEEE P1220, will also be highlighted.
