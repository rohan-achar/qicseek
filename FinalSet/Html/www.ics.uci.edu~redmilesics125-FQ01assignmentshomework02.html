<H3>Due Wednesday, October 17, by 5 p.m. through email to <A HREF="mailto:rijitg@ics.uci.edu">rijitg@ics.uci.edu</A></H3>

<P>You are to create a Web page for your team. The Web page should contain
the information listed below. <B>Send the URL (not the file) for the page
to Rijit as indicated above.</B> Remember to set protections for the &quot;world&quot;
to browse your page.</P>

<P><B>Team Name.</B> You may want to choose a name for your group to give
yourselves some identity. In the past, teams have given themselves nicknames
based on the longer project name. Most Project names are short enough to
serve as the team name, e.g., &quot;Java2D GEF.&quot; However, you have
the option to invent a name.</P>

<P><B>Team Logo.</B> Create some sort of logo or placeholder for your team.</P>

<P><B>Project Name.</B> The &quot;official&quot; name of the project you
want to bid on. This name is taken from the projects Web page.</P>

<P><B>Contact Person/Client.</B> The name and email of the client, as in
project Web pages.</P>

<P><B>Summary.</B> You should write your own one or two paragraph (about
12 to 15 sentence) summary of the project. This summary should be in your
own words and it should capture what you see to be salient features of
the project. Therefore it is not simply the summary from the project Web
pages.</P>

<P><B>Team Members.</B> You should include a list of the team members,
with one member listed as the &quot;lead.&quot; Each name should link to
your individual Web page. If you are dividing responsibilities up in your
group, you can choose to list responsibilities next to the names (see e.g.
the list of roles in the Mythical Man-Month). Of course, each team member
should assist with every activity in the project, but different members
may take the lead or the responsibility for different activities (e.g.,
testing, requirements, etc.).</P>

<P><B>Additional Links.</B> You may include an annotated list of links
at the end of the Web page. These will include at least a reference to
the appropriate projects Web page. It may include links relevant to types
of technologies that you think you will use..</P>
