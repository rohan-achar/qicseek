<h3> Brief Bio </h3>
<!-- <br><br><font color=#62021a> <b> -->
I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">School of Information and Computer Science</a>, <a href="http://www.uci.edu/"> University of California Irvine</a>. My advisor is <a href ="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/">Prof. Cristina Lopes</a>, Department of Informatics, University of California Irvine.<br>
I was awarded Master of Science in Information and Computer Science at University of California, Irvine in 2012.
My disseration topic was<a href="http://antpac.lib.uci.edu/record=b5104031~S7"> Enhancing Component Identification Using Machine Learning</a>. <br>
I was fortunate to have <a href ="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/">Prof. Cristina Lopes</a>, <a href ="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~andre/">Prof. Andre van der Hoek</a>, <a href ="http://jamesajones.com/">Prof. James Jones</a>, <a href ="http://sunset.usc.edu/~neno/">Prof. Nenad Medvidovic</a>, and <a href ="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ihler/">Prof. Alexander Ihler</a> in my dissertation committee. <br> <br>

Before joining University of California Irvine, I worked at <a href="http://www.tcs-trddc.com/">Tata Research Development and Design Centre, India.</a> 
I have had the privilege of doing internships from industrial research labs to product groups to startups.<br>  
I spent my summer'11 at <a href="www.srch2.com/">SRCH2</a>, a startup specialized in improving user experiences in the domain of search; summer'12 in a product group <a href="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/go/IEB-Microsoft-Mediaroom/343339/">(Interactive Entertainment Business)</a> at Microsoft Silicon Valley; <br>
summer'13 in <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/hip/">Human Interactions in Programming</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ese/">Empirical Software Engineering</a> groups at Microsoft Research in Redmond. <br> <br>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My primary research interest has been in the area of Software Engineering with an emphasis on Software Evolution. I am interested in developing theoretical and practical techniques and tools for helping people to <br>
understand, and modify software systems. My research activities to achieve this goal so far span the spectrum from quantitative measures for software properties, to analysis of software changes, to code modularization, to <br>
architecture recovery. <br><br>
 
In order to ultimately overcome the essential difficulties, it has been recognized that both the processes and products of software development should be formalized and automated. I believe that AI/ML techniques can <br> 
play an important role in this effort since the field of software engineering turns out to be one such fertile domain where many software development and maintenance tasks could be formulated as learning problems <br> 
and ML techniques could be used to obtain solutions.<br>
