<h1>Distributed Online Call Control on General Networks</h1>

<h2>John Augustine</h2>

<h3>November 4, 2005, in CS 259</h3>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>This talk will be a presentation of a paper
by Harald R&auml;cke, and Adi Ros&eacute;n from SODA 2005.</p>

<p>We study the problem of online call admission and routing ("call
control") on general networks. We give new algorithms that with high
probability achieve a poly-logarithmic fraction (in the size of the
network) of the optimal solution. The decisions of our algorithms do not
depend on the current load of all network links, as in previous
algorithms for general network topologies [AAP93]. Instead, their
admission decisions depend only on link loads along a single path
between the communicating parties, and they can thus be performed in a
distributed hop-by-hop manner through the network. Furthemore, our
algorithms can handle concurrent requests in the network.</p>
