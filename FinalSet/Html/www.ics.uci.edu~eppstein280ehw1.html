Homework Assignment 1
</h1>

<ol type=a>
<li>Think of a problem in NP. Describe carefully the input, the possible
solutions, and why it is easy to check whether a solution is correct.
Specific application-type problems preferred to abstract theory-type
ones.  If you're feeling uninspired, try <a
href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~viggo/problemlist/compendium.html">the
compendium of NP optimization problems</a> or some of the puzzles
from my page of
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/hard.html">complexity
theory for games and puzzles</a>.

<p>It's ok if your problem does not meet the strict definition of being
in NP, as long as it has the same form: a yes/no problem such that a yes
answer means that there is some kind of solution which can be quickly
checked for correctness, even though it might be difficult to find the
solution.</p>

<li>Describe how to translate instances of your problem into instances
of one of the problems described in class: constraint satisfaction,
maximum independent set, or traveling salesman.

<p>(Note that this is the opposite direction of translation from what you
would use to prove your problem NP-complete.)</p>

<li>What is (are) the natural measure(s) of problem size for your problem?
What size instances does your translation produce, as a function of the
input size?  If the constraint satisfaction (or maximum independent set) problem takes time c^n
to solve, how much time would it take to solve your original problem
using this translation and a CSP (or MIS) algorithm?
</ol>

<ol type=a>
<li>Finding <a href="/~eppstein/ca/">moving patterns in Conway's Game of
Life</a>.

<p>Input: numbers W,L,S,P.<br>
Output: "yes" if there exists a pattern that repeats itself
P generations after the start, shifted over by S steps, and
that fits within a W*L rectangle.</p>

<p>To check a solution, simply compute the evolution of the pattern for
P steps, and compare the result with a shifted copy of the original
pattern.  (This problem is not actually in NP, because the input size is
so small that even writing down a solution is exponential in
the input size.)</p>

<li>We translate to an instance of CSP.

<p>Form a binary variable for each pair (c,t), where c is a cell in the W*L
rectangle and t is a time step from 0 to P-1.  Form a constraint for
each such variable, saying that the variable should match the result of
evolving the nine neighboring cells in time step (t-1), or (if t=0)
that it should match the result of evolving the nine cells
surrounding the point S steps away from its position in step P-1.  Also add
one more constraint, that at least one cell is nonempty.</p>

<li>The natural measures are simply the numbers W, L, and P.
The translated CSP has W*L*P variables, so the time would be
c^{W*L*P}.
