<B>Pine(TM) is an electronic mail system created and 
maintained by the Computing & Communications group 
at the University of Washington. To help support Pine, a 
<A
href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/Getting_Started_On_Pine.html">
starter version of this document</A>
 was created by C&C in 
1994 for Pine 3.9. To meet local needs and conditions, 
modifications may have been made to either Pine or this 
document or both by local computer consultants. The 
local version of this document is maintained by

Electronic mail (email) allows you to communicate quickly and easily with 
colleagues on campus and around the world. The use of email is rapidly 
increasing, changing teaching, learning, research, health care, business, and 
administration. Pine is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use email program that was 
created at the University of Washington with the specific goal of being 
responsive to new email users. Pine offers:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI>
  <B>On-Screen Menus and Messages:</B> Pine displays your options in menus at 
   the bottom of each screen, so you do not need to memorize commands. 
   On-screen messages appear on a line above the command menu to give you 
   warnings or information as you make a choice.
  <P>

  <LI>
   <B>Online HELP:</B> Help is instantly available to provide information about 
   the task you are performing.

<P>

This document should be read at your computer while you use Pine. The text
that follows does not tell you everything about Pine. It only introduces
Pine's main options and summarizes basic email guidelines. The best way to
learn to use Pine is to explore it on your own. Pine was designed to make
it easy for you to learn to use email: there is information on each screen
and in the online help that shows you what to do or answers your
questions. Try the different options and have fun experimenting with Pine. 
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="before_start">Before You Start Pine</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>

Before you can use Pine to correspond by email, you need to have a userid (an 
account) on a computer and log in. For details, see the computing consultant 
for your department.

<P>

<B>To start:</B> The details of how to start Pine vary considerably from site to
site.  Consult your local support staff for further information. After
starting Pine, the Main Menu screen appears. Each Pine screen has a
similar layout: the top line tells you the screen name and additional
useful information, below that is the work area (on the Main Menu screen,
the work area is a menu of options), then the message/prompt line, and
finally the menu of commands. 
<P>

<B>To quit:</B> When you want to leave Pine, type <B>Q</B> (Quit). For details, see 
"Quitting Pine and Logging Out".
<P>

<B>The Main Menu</B>
<P>

The Main Menu lists Pine's main options (see Figure 1). The letter you must 
type to enter your choice is to the left of each option or command name. You 
can usually type either uppercase or lowercase letters, and you should not 
press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B> to enter commands.
<P>

>From the Main Menu, you can read online help, write and send a message, look 
at an index of your mail messages, open or maintain your mail folders, update 
your address book, configure or update Pine, and quit Pine.

<B>Getting Help in Pine</B>
<P>

To read the online help, use the Help command at the bottom of each
screen.  For example, at the Main Menu screen, type <B>?</B> (Help). Because the
help text is context sensitive, you never see all of it at once--only the
part that relates to the Pine feature you are using. To exit the online
help, type <B>E</B> (Exit Help).

In the command menu above, the ^ character is used to indicate the Control 
key. This means you must hold down the Control key (written in this document 
as <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B>) while you press the letter for each command. 
<P>

Press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> (Get Help) to see additional commands. To move around, 
use the arrow keys or <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>N</B> (Next line) and <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B>

<B>Hints for Writing a Message</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>To:</B> 
<DD>
In this field, type the email addresses of your recipients. Separate the 
    addresses with commas. When you are finished, press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>.
    Note that if you type in only the userid (login name) of your
    recipient, the
    Pine program assumes that the "right-hand part" of your recipient's
    address
    is the same as yours (e.g., <I>art.somewhere.edu)</I>, unless you explicitly
    enter a
    different one.  Always check the addresses in both the To: and
    the Cc: fields for accuracy and completeness before you send a message.
<P>
<DD>
   <B> Finding and Formatting Addresses.</B>
    The best way to get a person's email 
    address is to ask him or her for it. For more information on finding and 
    formatting email addresses on local and remote computers, press 
    <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> (Get Help) in the To: field.
<P>
<DD>
    <B>Using the Address Book</B>.
     In both the To: and the Cc: fields, you can 
    enter a person's email address manually, or you can use an entry from your 
    Pine Address Book. See "Using the Address Book".
<P>
<DT>
<B>Cc:</B>
<DD>
 In this field, type the email addresses of the persons to whom you want to 
    send copies. Separate their addresses with commas. When you are 
    finished, or if you do not want to send any copies, press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>. 
<P>

<B>Attchmnt:</B> 
<DD>
This is an advanced Pine feature that allows you to attach files, 
    including word processing documents, spreadsheets, or images that exist on 
    the same computer where you are running Pine. If you do not want to 
    attach a file to your message, press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>. For more information, with 
    your cursor in the Attchmnt: field, press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> (Get Help).
<P>
<DT>
<B>Subject:</B> 
<DD>
In this field, enter a one-line description of your message. A short, 
    pertinent description is appreciated by the recipients, since this is
    what they
    see when they scan their email index. When finished, press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>. 
<P>
<DT>
<B>Message Text:</B> 
<DD>
Type your message. To move around, use the <B>arrow keys</B>. To 
    delete characters, press <B>&lt;Backspace&gt;</B> or 
    <B>&lt;Delete&gt;</B>. To delete a line, 
    press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>K</B>. To justify your text, 
    press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>J</B>. To check 
    your spelling, press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>T</B>. To see other editing commands,
     press 
    <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> (Get Help).
<P>

    <B>Inserting a Plain Text File</B>. If you want to send a "plain text" 
file with 
    your message, you can insert the file in the body of your message using 
    the <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>R</B> (Read in a File) command. Plain text files are files 
    created by text editors such as Pico, the editor you use when you compose a 
    Pine message. For information about inserting files, with your cursor
    in the
    Message Text: field, press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> (Get Help).

Pine stores messages sent to you (including those you send to yourself) in your 
INBOX folder. Messages remain in your INBOX folder until you delete them 
or save them in other folders. (You will learn more about the INBOX and other 
folders in "Pine Folders".)

The selected message is highlighted. The first 
column on the left shows the message status. It may be blank, or it may contain 
"N" if the message is new (unread), 
"+" if the message was sent directly to you (it is not a copy or from a list), 
"A" if you have answered the message (using the Reply command), or 
"D" if you have marked the message for deletion. 
The rest of the columns in the message line show you the message number, date 
sent, sender, size, and subject. For details, press <B>?</B> (Help).
<P>

Most of the commands you need to handle your messages are listed at the 
bottom of the screen. You can type <B>O</B> (Other Commands) to see the additional 
commands that are available. You do not need to see these commands on the

    You are asked whether you want to include the original message in your 
    reply. Also, if the original message was sent to more than one person, you 
    are asked if you want to reply to all recipients. Think carefully
    before you
    answer--it may be that you do not want your reply to be sent to more 
    than 
    just the author of the message. It is always a good idea to verify that the 
    addresses in the To: and Cc: fields are correct before you send a message.

<H2><A NAME="folders">Pine Folders</H2>
<HR>
<P>

Incoming messages may quickly accumulate in your INBOX folder. Imagine 
what it would be like to find one hundred messages there. If you use email 
often, this may happen sooner than you expect. How should you organize the 
messages you wish to save?
<P>

<B>Organizing Messages With Folders</B>
<P>

A Pine folder, like a folder in your file cabinet, is a storage place for
messages.  As you use email, you accumulate many messages and can organize
them into different folders by topic, correspondent, date, or any other
category that is meaningful to you. You can create your own folders, and
Pine automatically provides three: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
   <B>The INBOX folder</B>--messages sent to you are listed in this folder. When 
    you first start Pine and go to the Folder Index screen, you are
    looking at the
    list of messages in your INBOX folder. Every incoming message remains in 
    your INBOX until you delete it or save it in another folder.
<P>
<LI>
   <B>The saved-messages folder</B>--copies of messages you save are stored in 
    this folder unless you save them to other folders you create yourself. See 
    "Saving a Message". 
<P>
<LI>
   <B>The sent-mail folder</B>--copies of messages you send are automatically 
    stored in this folder. This is convenient if you cannot remember whether 
    you actually sent a message or if you want to send a message again. 
</UL>
<B>Keeping Folders Clean</B>
<P>

Messages--whether they are in your INBOX or your other Pine folders--occupy
storage space, and your storage space is limited. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
    Check your email frequently to see if you have any new messages. 
<P>

    Do not keep too many messages in your INBOX folder. A large INBOX 
    reduces performance: it takes longer to display large lists of messages 
    when you start Pine, and it requires more time to move between messages.
<P>

    Delete your incoming messages right away if you do not want them, or save 
    them to other folders if you do.
<P>
<LI> 
    Routinely delete obsolete messages from all of your Pine folders.
<P>
<LI>
    You will get a monthly message via Pine that asks if you want to delete 
    entire sent-mail folders (and all the messages they contain) from previous 
    months. To conserve space, it is a good idea to do this. If you choose to 
    delete such sent mail, type <B>y</B>.
</UL> 
<P>

<B>Moving Between Folders</B>
<P>

When you start Pine and press <B>I</B> (Index) at the Main Menu, you see a list of 
messages in your INBOX folder. If you want to see the messages in another 
folder, you need to go to that folder. The following text shows you two ways to 
go to another folder from nearly anywhere in Pine. 
<P>

<I>To access your folders and the messages that are stored in them:</I>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Type <B>L</B> (Folder List). 
<P>

    You see a Folder List screen like the following, in which your current
    folder
    is highlighted. (When you start Pine, the current folder is your INBOX.)

When you save a message, you are given a choice: you can store it in the saved-
messages folder, or you can specify another folder. 
<P>

Once you save a message, the copy in the INBOX folder is automatically 
marked for deletion so that you will only have one copy. When you quit Pine,

<I>To save a message to the saved-messages folder:</I>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
    At the Index screen, use the <B>arrow keys</B> to [Folder "INBOX" opened with
    2 messages]
    the message you
    want to save, or, at the Message Text screen as you view a message:
<P>

    Type <B>S</B> (Save).
<P>

    You are asked if you want to save the message to the saved-messages folder 
    or to another folder:
<P>

   <TT> SAVE to folder [saved-messages]:</TT> 
<P>
<LI>
Press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B> to choose the default folder: ["saved-messages"].

    <TT>SAVE to folder [saved-messages]:</TT> 
<P>
<LI>
Type a <I>foldername</I> and press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>. 
<P>

    For example, to save a message to a folder named "papers," 
    type <B>papers</B> and press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>. 
<P>

    If this is the first time you have named this folder, you see the message:
<P>

    <TT>Folder "papers" doesn't exist. Create? </TT>
<P>

    Type <B>y</B> or press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B> to create the folder. 
<P>

    Once you have created the folder, or whenever you type the name of a

<H2><A NAME="deleting">Deleting a Message</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>

You keep your Pine folders clean by routinely deleting messages. There are two 
steps to deleting a message: marking it for deletion, then expunging it.
<P>

<I>To mark for deletion a message you do not want: </I>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
    Select and open the folder that contains the message you wish to mark for 
    deletion. If you are a Pine beginner, this is probably your INBOX 
    folder. See "Moving Between Folders", if the message you want 
    to mark for deletion is in a folder other than your INBOX.

<P>
<LI>
    At the Folder Index screen, select the message you want to mark for 
    deletion, or simply view the message.
<P>
<LI>
    Type <B>D</B> (Delete). 
<P>

    If you are looking at the Folder Index screen when you mark a message for 
    deletion, a "D" appears in the left-hand column of the message line. 
<P>

    If you are looking at the Message Text screen when you mark a message for 
    deletion, a "DEL appears in the upper right corner of your screen. The 
    next message, if there is one, appears. 
</OL>

Repeat this process to mark additional messages for deletion.
<P>

<B>Undeleting a Message</B>
<P>

If you change your mind about a message you have marked for deletion, use the 
<B>U</B> (Undelete) command to remove the deletion mark any time <I>before</I> you 
expunge a message. After you expunge a message, Pine cannot get it back.
<P>

<B>Expunging a Message</B>
<P>

A message that is marked for deletion remains in Pine until you expunge 
it. You can expunge a message that is marked for deletion at any time, or you 
can wait until you quit Pine. Once you have a few messages marked for 
deletion, you may want to expunge them before you continue to work, because 
it is easier to look through a folder index that contains fewer messages. 
<P>

<I>To expunge a message:</I>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
    At the Folder Index screen, type <B>X</B> (Expunge).
<P>

    You are asked: 
<P>

   <TT> Expunge "#" message(s) from "folder"?</TT> 
<P>
<LI>
Type <B>y</B> (yes) or press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>.
<P>

    Messages marked for deletion disappear.
</OL>

Note that you will be asked whether you want to expunge messages that are 
marked for deletion when you leave a folder (other than the INBOX) that 
contains messages marked for deletion, or when you quit your Pine session.

There are two ways to set up an individual address in your Address Book. You 
can add an address manually or take it more easily from an incoming message. 
With either method, you specify nicknames for your correspondents. You can 
also set up a group (list) address in your Address Book, but only manually.
<P>

<B>Adding an Individual Address</B>
<P>

<I>To add an individual address manually:</I> 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>

<P>
<LI>
 Follow the instructions. (Press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> if you need help.)
</OL>

<B>Taking an Individual Address From an Incoming Message</B>
<P>

<I>To take an individual address from a message you are viewing or have 
selected in the index:</I>
<OL>
<LI>
    Type <B>T</B> (Take Address). The <B>T</B> command is not visible on your screen 
    unless you type <B>O</B> (Other Commands), but you need not see it to use it. 
<P>
<LI>
    Follow the instructions. (Press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>G</B> if you need help.)
</OL>

<B>Adding a Group (List) Address</B>
<P>

If you routinely send messages to a group, you can create a list address. That 
way you do not need to type each person�s address every time you send a 
message to the group. 
<P>

<I>To create a list address: </I>

<B>Using Address Book Entries When Composing Email</B>
<P>

When composing a message, at the To: or the Cc: (Carbon Copy) fields you 
can enter an email address in any of the following ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
   Type the entire email address. 
<P>
<LI>
   Type a nickname you have set up in the Address Book. 
<P>

   For example, if your Address Book looked like the one in Figure 6, you 
   could type the following nickname in the To: field: 
<P>

   <TT>mu</TT>
<P>

   After you pressed <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>, Pine would provide the full address for Mu 
   from the Address Book as follows:
<P>

   <TT>To: 		Mu Li &lt;muli@u.university.edu&gt;</TT>
<P>
<LI>
   Select a name from the Address Book:
<P>

   Move to the Address Book (with your cursor in the To: or  Cc:   field 
   press <B>&lt;Control&gt;</B><B>T</B>) and use the <B>arrow keys</B> to highlight the name you 
   want. Type <B>S</B> (Select) or press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>.

Pine has other useful features that have not been covered in this
introductory document. Although originally designed for novice email
users, Pine has evolved to support many advanced features. It has become
an easy-to-use program for sending, receiving, and filing Internet
electronic mail messages and bulletin board (Netnews) messages including
multimedia attachments. There is also a PC version of Pine for use with
IMAP mail servers. If you would like to learn more about Pine:

    ones that appear when you type <B>O</B> (OTHER CMDS).

    Read Pine's online help often. It contains tips to help you at every
    stage of
    learning Pine. Read about different functions, even those you do not
    use yet.

Your local system managers may have customized Pine to suit specific needs, 
and they may or may not offer all of Pine's ever-growing set of 
configuration 
and personal-preference options. Thus, your local system managers are a good 
source of information about additional Pine features.

<H2><A NAME="guidelines">Guidelines for Using Email</A></H2>
<HR>
<P>

Electronic mail is a unique medium of communication. Messages can be
replied to or forwarded with speed and ease, and email has the potential
to reach a wide audience. These features can also be misused. There are a
few basic guidelines for the responsible use of email that can help you
avoid common mistakes while you enjoy the full benefits of this
technology. 
<P>

The privacy of an email message cannot be guaranteed. An email message may 
be forwarded, printed, or permanently stored by any recipient. Email can be 
misdirected, even when you are careful. Do not put something in an email 
message that you would not want read by everybody. And if you receive a 
message intended for someone else, let the sender know. 
<P>

Email does not show the subtleties of voice or body language. Avoid
attempts at irony or sarcasm. The most effective email is short, clear,
and relevant. If you receive a message that makes you upset, do not
respond immediately, and in any case, avoid "flaming," that is, sending an
angry or rude message. 
<P>

<B>Email Tips</B>
<P>

As you use email, keep the following tips in mind:
<UL>
<LI>
    Email is easily forwarded to someone else. Although this is convenient, it 
    is not always appropriate. If you are unsure, ask the sender before you 
    forward a message. 
<P>
<LI>
    Email replies may go to more people than you realize. When replying to a 
    message, be sure to look at the list of recipients. 
<P>
<LI>
    Email can be junk mail, so avoid unnecessary proliferation of messages. 
<P>
<LI>
    Email takes up computer space, so delete messages you no longer need. 
<P>
<LI>
    The integrity of an email message cannot be guaranteed. If a received 
    message seems out of character for the sender, double-check before taking 
    it seriously. 
<P>
<LI>
    Email is meant for informal correspondence as well as scholarly,
    scientific,
    and clinical communications. You should not use email for official record 
    purposes where a memo would be required (e.g., personnel actions, 
    organization changes, contracts, and policy statements).
<P>
<LI>
    Email should not be considered private. Confidential information should 
    not be sent by email.
</UL>
