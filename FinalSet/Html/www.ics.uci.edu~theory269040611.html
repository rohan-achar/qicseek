<h2>Jeremy Yu Meng</br>
Computing the Visibility Graph of Points Within a Polygon</br>
</h2>

<p>This is a presentation of the paper
"Computing the Visibility Graph of Points Within a Polygon,"
by Boaz Ben-Moshe, Olaf Hall-Holt, and Matthew J. Katz, and Joseph Mitchell,
<i>SCG&nbsp;2004</i>.

<p>
Abstract: The authors study the problem of computing the visibility
graph defined by a set <i>P</i> of <i>n</i> points inside a polygon
<i>Q</i>: two points <i>p,q</i> in <i>P</i> are joined by an edge if
the segment <i>pq</i> is contained in <i>Q</i>.

<h2>Kevin Wortman</br>
On finding a guard that sees most and a shop that sells most</br>
</h2>

<p>This is a presentation of the paper
"On Finding a Guard That Sees Most and a Shop That Sells Most,"
by Otfried Cheong, Alon Efrat, and Sariel Har-Peled,
<i>Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete
Algorithms</i>.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a near-quadratic time algorithm that computes
a point inside a simple polygon <i>P</i> having approximately the
largest visibility polygon inside <i>P</i>, and near-linear time
algorithm for finding the point that will have approximately the
largest Voronoi region when added to an <i>n</i>-point set. We apply
the same technique to find the translation that approximately
maximizes the area of intersection of two polygonal regions in
near-quadratic time.

<p>Due to time constraints I will be focusing on a few select results of
the paper.
