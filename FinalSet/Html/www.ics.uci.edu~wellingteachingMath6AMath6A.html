<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Text:</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="+1">
<BR>
There is one required textbook for the course:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications,<BR>
Fifth Edition, by Kenneth H. Rosen (McGraw-Hill 1999).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The textbook explains the subject material
in detail. It is strongly recommended that you read the book.
It is strongly recommended that you read the book and attend all
lectures and all meetings of your discussion section. You will
be responsible for all material covered in the lectures and discussion
sections, and for all assigned reading in the book. This course
requires no programming.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Course Grades:</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
There will be 7-8 homework and 7-8 quizzes. Homework will be assigned
each Thursday and will be due on Thursday the following week.
Quizzes will be given every Tuesday at the beginning of class.
There will be one midterm and one final. The grading criteria
for the course is:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Homework assignments 15%<BR>
Quizzes 35%<BR>
Midterm 20%<BR>
Final 30%</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We will drop the lowest 2 quiz scores and the
two lowest homework score in determining your final grade. The
midterm exam will be given in lecture. It is scheduled for <U>Thursday
May 13</U>. The final examination is scheduled for TBA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">These are guidelines intended to help students
plan their work in this course. However, the instructor does reserve
the right to make changes in these evaluation criteria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A work-related conflict is NOT a valid reason
for postponing an examination. The dates of the examination are
being announced now. Plan accordingly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Please bring your student ID to all examinations.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Obtaining Assistance:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
The best way to get your questions answered is by coming to lecture,
discussion or office hours and asking them there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Any student who feels he or she may need an
accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact
me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact
the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible
to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a
timely fashion.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Announcements:</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
Class announcements will be made in lecture and in discussion.
Important announcements will also be posted on the class Web page.
The Web page will contain the most up-to-date course information.
Any corrections or additional explanations for the homework assignments
will also be posted there, so please check the Web page occasionally
to stay up to date.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Homework and Handouts:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
The homework assignments are regularly posted on the Web.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Some homework problems may be difficult. Homework
that is turned in should be legible and well-written. A badly
written, poorly presented solution to a problem is of little value
even if it happens to be correct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The homework problems are an integral part
of the course. They complement the material covered in the lectures
by providing examples, applications, and extensions. You are strongly
encouraged to attempt all problems. Even if you cannot solve them,
if you have tried hard to solve them you may be more likely to
understand and remember the solution. Our brains learn something
while attempting to solve a problem, even (and perhaps especially)
during failed attempts. So do not get discouraged if a problem
is difficult.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Discussion Section:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
You must be registered for a discussion section. The discussion
section provides you with an opportunity to ask questions about
the lecture material. It is strongly recommended that you attend
a discussion section regularly. You are responsible for all material
covered there.<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
<B><I>Late Assignments:</I></B><BR>
Homework assignments are due every Thursday by 3:00 PM in the
distribution center. Absolutely no homework assignments will be
accepted after 3:00 PM. If your homework is not turned by then,
you will receive a 0.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There will be a quiz given every Tuesday at
the beginning of lecture. The quiz will be handed out at 3:30
PM, sharp and will be picked up at 3:45 PM, sharp. When we tabulate
your final grade, we will drop the two lowest quiz scores and
the two lowest homework scores. However, in exchange for this,
we well make absolutely no allowances if you arrive at a quiz
late or turn in your homework late. This holds even if you have
a perfectly valid reason to miss a homework assignment or a quiz.
If for some reason you fail to make it to a quiz or hand in a
homework assignment, that will count as one of your dropped quizzes
or homework assignments, no matter how legitimate your reason
is.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Grading:</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
Only parts of the homework assignments will be graded. However,
you will not know which particular problems will be graded before
you hand in your assignment.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Questions on Grading:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
For any questions regarding grades, please contact the TA during
his office hours or at the end of the discussion sections.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Collaboration:</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
You are allowed, and even encouraged, to discuss the solutions
to the homework with your fellow classmates. However, you are
required to sit down and write up your own solutions independently.
In addition, you need to write down the names of any classmates
with whom you have collaborated on a given assignment, clearly
indicating that they are your collaborators. Copying the homework
assignment of another student is considered cheating. Keep in
mind that the homework contributes little to your final grade
in comparison to the quizzes. Thus, it is very much in your own
best interest to have a thorough understanding of the homework
assignments before the quiz.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Academic Honesty:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
All work done on quizzes, midterms and finals should be your own
work. Cheating on any kind of in class examination will be taken
very seriously. Any such incident will result in a letter describing
the incident which is placed in your file on campus. Depending
on the severity of the incident, the resulting grade can range
from an F on the particular examination to an automatic F in the
course. Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department
and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty
can result in suspension or expulsion from the university.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">ICS Change of Grade Option Policy:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to change their
grade option is the end of 6th week with instructor's approval.
Dean's signature (available at the ICS Student Affairs office)
will be required after the deadline and the ICS Student Affairs
office does not allow a change of grade option for any course
after 6th week, unless the student has documented a medical or
financial hardship.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">ICS Add Deadline:</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE="+1"><BR>
The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to add an ICS
course is the end of 3rd week with instructor's approval. Any
course additions after the 3rd week of classes requires Dean's
signature and careful review by the ICS Student Affairs office.
If you are adding a course after the 3rd week, please go to the
ICS Student Affairs office.<BR>
