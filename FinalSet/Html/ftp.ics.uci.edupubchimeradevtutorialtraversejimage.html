<H2>Link Traversal</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
 Now you can use Chimera to traverse the Link.  There are two kinds of
Link traversals which will be demonstrated below.  The first is
one between your two open images.  The next is from an open image
to one that has been closed.
</p>

<H3>Traversal between open images</H3>

<p> Once you have made anchors on bill.gif and earthrise.gif, and have
connected them to the Active Link places_to_go, all you need to do to 
have a link traversal is to move the mouse inside the anchor area of
one image and click once with the left mouse button.  
</p>

<p> Click once within the anchor area of bill.gif, and the anchor in 
earthrise.gif should flash like the following:
</p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/earth_traversed_to.gif" WIDTH="639"
HEIGHT="490"></CENTER>

<H3>Traversal to a closed image</H3>

<p>
Jimage does not need to have an image open to respond to a link traversal.
To show you that you can traverse a Link to a closed image, 
close the earthrise image.
</p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/bill_alone.gif" WIDTH="530"
HEIGHT="353"></CENTER>

<p> To do a link traversal which will bring up the earthrise image 
with the anchor flashed, just click the left mouse button within the 
anchor area on the bill image.  The earthrise image should 
pop up shortly with its anchor flashing in a bright color 
something like the following:
</p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/bill_to_earth_screenshot.gif" WIDTH="700"
HEIGHT="619"></CENTER>

<p>Now you are ready to use Chimera for yourself.  There are some 
further examples which will show you more of the power of Chimera.
