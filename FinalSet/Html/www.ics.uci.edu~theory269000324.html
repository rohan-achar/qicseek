(In-)Approximability of Visibility Problems in Polygons and
Terrains<br>
Stephan Eidenbenz, ETH Zurich</h2>

<p>Visibility problems appear in a variety of applicative
backgrounds. While the traditional "art gallery" problem, which
consists of guarding a given floorplan of an art gallery by a
minimum number of guards seems to be mainly of theoretical
interest, a variation of this problem, where a 2.5 dimensional
terrain rather than a two dimensional polygonal floorplan needs to
be guarded, is of practical significance in the planning of
wireless communication networks, where minimizing the numbers of
antennas reduces overall costs.</p>

<p>In a visibility problem, we are given an input polygon, which
may or may not contain holes, or a 2.5 dimensional triangulated
terrain. Since a lot of visibility problems are NP-hard, we study
the approximation characteristics of these problems. In the talk,
an overview of recent inapproximability as well as approximability
results will be presented for a variety of NP-hard visibility
problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>guarding a polygon with or without holes or a terrain with a
minimum number of guards,</li>

<li>hiding a maximum number of points from each other in a polygon
or a terrain, and</li>

<li>covering a polygon with a minimum number of convex polygons
that lie inside the given polygon.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will discuss an inapproximability result for at least one of
these problems in more detail, which should give a general idea of
how to prove inapproximability of visibility problems. Finally, an
approximation algorithm for a visibility problem will be
presented.</p>
