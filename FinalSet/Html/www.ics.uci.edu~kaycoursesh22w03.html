<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Course goals:</B>  As the second course
in the first-year sequence, ICS 22 broadens and deepens your understanding
of computer science in many ways:  how to measure, analyze, compare, and
talk about the efficiency of programs and algorithms; how to build and use
more flexible data structures than lists and arrays; and how to design more
substantial programs by more sophisticated object-oriented programming and
by using different programming paradigms and models of computation.  As
this is an honors course, we will cover a broader and deeper set of topics
than the conventional course.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>ICS 22 is an exciting course because of the
many horizons it broadens.  We welcome you, and we hope you enjoy it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  To succeed
in ICS 22, students should understand the fundamental programming concepts
presented in a course like ICS 21.  These include control structures for
selection (if-then-else, switch) and repetition (loops); procedures, parameter
passing, scope of variables, and the general concept of modular program
design; the concept of object-oriented programming including how to define
classes; predefined and programmer-defined data structures (including arrays);
and classic algorithms such as linear search.  Students should also be able
to write with relative ease programs in Java that make use of these concepts.
</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>We also expect each student to be able to
navigate the Windows systems in our labs, to navigate the World-Wide Web,
and to read and send electronic mail.  Some of our assignments will require
these skills.  If you need to pick these skills up or sharpen them, you
should do it in the first week of the quarter; the library offers short
courses that you may find helpful.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:50 in CS 180.  You must enroll in
one of the two discussion/lab sections:
<BR>
1. &#160; Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 11 in CS 253 and at 12 in CS 192
<BR>
2. &#160; Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 3 in CS 243 and at 4 in CS 183 (MW)
and CS 189 (F)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop
by my office at any time.  If I&#39;m there and not immersed in something
else, I&#39;ll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.
 I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,
during which course-related matters will have first priority:  Tuesdays
from 11 to noon and Thursdays from 2 to 2:30.  Of course emergencies may
come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.  I&#39;ll
also be happy to make appointments for other times during the week.  The
quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described
below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the
ID </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="mailto:icsh22@uci.edu">icsh22@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.
 This goes to both of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you
need to reach one of us individually, use our individual IDs listed above.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>We may also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another
account, you should set your UCInet account to forward Email to your preferred
account (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate">http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>).
 Don&#39;t let this slip; if you miss official announcements, your grade
could suffer. </FONT></P>

when you log on to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">eee.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
.  We don&#39;t use a news group for this course.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Labs and lab hours:</B>  Of course you
will need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday/Wednesday/Friday
lab hours. Students in ICS H22 may use any of the department&#39;s instructional
computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the
lab exclusively.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
for lab hours and other information.  Note in particular that all ICS labs
are closed on university holidays.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Please remember that programming tasks always
take longer to complete than you think they will, no matter how much experience
you have.  You must account for this as you plan your time; we cannot accept
crowded labs as an excuse for late or incomplete assignments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Working at home: </B> Doing your lab work
at home is comfortable, convenient, economical, and safe.  It even benefits
students who work in the lab by freeing up the machine you would otherwise
be using.  But it&#39;s also isolated.  Close friendships and a &quot;support
network&quot; develop among students who use the labs.  These are your first
&quot;professional contacts&quot;; it would be unfortunate to miss that
opportunity completely. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Other useful addresses:  </B>The Engineering
Copy Center (ECC), in room 203 of Engineering I, is where we may distribute
various course materials; the ECC is open 8-12 and 1-4:30, Monday through
Friday.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Textbook:</B><I> Data Structures and Algorithms
in Java,</I> second edition, by Goodrich and Tamassia.  This text covers
most of the topics in the course, and includes an introduction to Java.
 It should be available in the UCI Bookstore.  It has a web site at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://datastructures.net/">http://datastructures.net/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,
which includes errata, animations, and other resources.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Course structure:
<BR>
</B><I><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h22/hw/index.html">About seven assignments</A>,</I>
some on paper and some in the lab.  (40% of the course grade)
<BR>
<I>One midterm:  </I>Given in lecture on Tuesday, February 4.  (25%)
<BR>
<I>One final exam:</I>  On Thursday, March 20, from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. 
(35%)We expect that most students in this course will earn a final grade
in the A range, as you would have done had you been enrolled in a conventional
offering of ICS 22.  However, that is not a guarantee that every student&#39;s
grade will be an A.  Conventional ICS 22 itself is a six-unit course that
requires a major time commitment, even from students with significant computing
experience or strong academic backgrounds.  A grade of at least B- in ICS
H22 is required to continue into ICS H23.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>What to do this week to get started in
ICS H22:
<BR>
</B>-- If you do not have a UCInet ID (an account on the EA system for reading
electronic mail), get one.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/computing/activate.html">http://www.oac.uci.edu/computing/activate.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
.
<BR>
-- If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your
UCInet account, redirect your mail at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate">http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
.
<BR>
-- If you do not have an ICS NT account for access to the Windows NT network
in ICS, get one.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~support/activacct.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~support/activacct.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
.
<BR>
-- On the Web, go to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu">http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,
log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing,&quot; click &quot;Go&quot;
next to ICS H22, and then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot;  You&#39;ll
submit some of your work electronically; this step is necessary to set that
up.
<BR>
-- Get a lab printing key-card (and at least one diskette if you have no
other way to back up your work).
<BR>
-- Give a snapshot of yourself (with your name written on the back) to your
TA.  This will help us learn your names quickly.  (This is not just for
fun--it&#39;s a course requirement.)  Also turn in your signed Questionnaire
to your TA in discussion section.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Good advice and helpful hints:  </B>Make
every effort to attend the lectures; we will make important announcements
and often cover material that isn&#39;t directly in the textbook.  It&#39;s
not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed, though
of course he will answer questions about it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Attend your discussion section, too; assignments
will be distributed, discussed, and collected there, exams will be reviewed
there, and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture.
 Discussion section is where you will get many details about Java and advice
and information specific to the lab assignments; missing your section is
like doing the assignments with both hands tied behind your back.  Don&#39;t
hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Check your electronic mail regularly; this
is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Be sure to read each lab assignment over,
and think about how to solve it, before you come to lab; professional programmers
plan on paper prior to starting to type.  The lab assignments, like all
technical specifications, require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.
 Expect to refer back to the assignment often, and check it first when you
have questions about what&#39;s required or how to proceed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Start early doing the lab assignments.  Programming
always takes longer to complete than you think it will, even if you have
previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll have time
to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
both on diskette and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle
(or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened), we&#39;ll
expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.  Finally, turn in
whatever portion of the assignment you have completed on the due date. 
In some circumstances you may arrange with your TA to work further on an
assignment after the due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when
the official due date comes.   </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need
it to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few
missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.
 Our text is not simple; you will want to read the assigned sections early
and quickly (for the main ideas, not to memorize every detail); then you
can ask your TA in section which parts merit closer attention.
