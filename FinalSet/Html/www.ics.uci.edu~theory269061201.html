<h1>Cache-Oblivious Dynamic Programming</h1>

<h2>Rezaul Alam Chowdhury and Vijaya Ramachandran</h2>

<h2>Presented by Kevin Wortman</h2>

Abstract:
<p>
We present efficient cache-oblivious algorithms for several
fundamental dynamic programs. These include new algorithms with
improved cache performance for longest common subsequence (LCS), edit
distance, gap (i.e., edit distance with gaps), and least weight
subsequence. We present a new cache-oblivious framework called the
Gaussian Elimination Paradigm (GEP) for Gaussian elimination without
pivoting that also gives cache-oblivious algorithms for Floyd-Warshall
all-pairs shortest paths in graphs and 'simple DP', among other
problems.
