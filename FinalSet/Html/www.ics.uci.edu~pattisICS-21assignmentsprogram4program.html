  Please print a copy of this assignment, read it carefully, and
    highlight material you think will be useful to you while you
    are working on the program or submitting it.
  <p>
  This programming assignment is designed to ensure that you know how to write
    programs that use constructors, methods, and fields (although rarely) in
    other classes.
  Of course, you will continue gaining experience with the standard control
    structures in Java (blocks, ifs, fors, breaks, try/catch) as well as the
    more basic Java features (declarations and expression statements using
     arithmetic, state-change, relational, and logical operators).
  <p>
  You will write four programs in this assignment.
  As always, you can check the behavior of your programs against mine by
    downloading, unzipping, and then running the file
     <a href="executable.zip">Program #4 Executables</a>,
    to help you understand the specification of the problem and observe the
    programmer/user interaction that you are to implement.
  See <a href="../program1/program.html">Program #1</a> for details on how
     to run these executables on both PCs and in Eclipse (PCs and Macs).
  Remember, you can run these programs, but not examine their source (Java)
    code.
  Copy the input/output form of the executable programs in the programs that
    you write: use exactly the same prompts and messages.
  <p>
  For your information, I am listing below the number of lines in my solution
    programs.
  These programs are formated in the standard way.
  I am counting only lines with code (even if the only code on the line is
    a brace that closes a block); but I am not counting blank lines norlines 
    filled with comments.
  My "big collatz" program is 24 lines; my "dice ewar" program is 72 lines; my
    "phone database" program is 37 lines; my "heart monitor" program is 67
    lines.
  Your programs might be smaller, and they might be larger; but if your program
    starts going over 2-3 times the size of mine, you might want to rethink it
    (or come get some help).
  <p>
  Please follow the instructions below for each program: finish each
    enhancement before continuing to the next one (including printing
    whatever messages it displays in the console, copied exactly).
  <p>
  The  <a href="../../programs/classexamples.zip">Class Examples</a> program
    illustrates the use of many classes, including the ones that you will need
    to use in this assignment.
  The last two programs require writing nested loops: one loop inside another.
  I used multiple <b>break</b> statements inside some of these loops.
  <p>
  To work on this assignment, create one Java project (call it <b>Program4</b>)
    and create four new Java classes in it.
  Each class will contain a program that you will write to solve one problem;
    name the classes <b>BigCollatz</b>, <b>DiceWar</b>, <b>PhoneDatabase</b>,
    and <b>ICD</b>.
  Write, run, and debug each class/program as you did in Program #3.
  When you finish each part, submit its <b>.java</b> file.
  <p>
  <b>Only one programmer of the pair should dropoff the programs: the same one
       for each part.
     It doesn't matter which of the pair submits, but that person should
       submit all the parts.
     Of course, each program should contain both student names (in the
        comment: the same one you cut, pasted, ane filled in at the top of
        each program in <a href="../program1/program.html">Program #1</a>).</b>

<td width ="80%">
  Don't start this project with the new project folder.
  Instead, download the <a href="Program4.zip">Program4</a>
    project folder, unzip it, and start a new project in Eclipse using
    this project folder (which contains a <b>Collatz.java</b> program
    that works for <b>int</b> values).
  Create the <b>DiceWar</b> and <b>PhoneDatabase</b> classes here.
  <p>
  When compiled and run, the <b>Collatz.java</b> class prompts the user for an
    <b>int</b> value and performs the Collatz process (read the comments for
    all the details) on that number until it is "reduced" to 1.
  We have seen this program before, when working with the Eclipse Debugger.
  <p>
  This program requires you to use objects constructed from the
     <b>BigInteger</b> class; remember to import it.
  <p>
  For this programming assignment, enhance this program to use variables that
     refer to <b>BigInteger</b> objects rather than store <b>int</b>
     primitives.
  In this way, there is almost no limit on the size of number that we can apply
    the Collatz process to, checking whether all values are ultimately reduced
    to 1 (which happens for all examples I've tried, and happens very quickly).
  <p>
  Fundamentally what you are doing in this program is translating from the
    use of primitive types and values to the use of reference types and
    objects.
  This is a good starting point for switching to object-oriented programming.
  It will involve importing the <b>BigInteger</b> class (see Javadoc for its
    full name, including its package).
  In addition, you should...
  <ul>
  <li>Use constructors for <b>BigInteger</b> objects to initialize
        variables/constants, instead of using <b>int</b> literals
        -there are no <b>BigInteger</b> literals!
      Also note that the <b>BigInteger</b> class declares some
        <b>public final</b> constants which you should find useful.
  <li>Use methods like <b>.divide</b>, <b>.multiply</b>, and <b>.add</b> to
        perform arithmetic on <b>BigInteger</b> values (instead of using
        arithmetic operators -they do not work for <b>BigInteger</b> values).
      Note that there are no state-change operators for <b>BigInteger</b> 
        objects (e.g., no <b>++</b>): like <b>String</b>, it is an immutable
        class.
  <li>Use methods like <b>.equals</b> and/or <b>.compareTo</b> to compare
      <b>BigInteger</b> values (instead of using relational operators: remember
      that <b>==</b> probably doesn't do what you want done!)
  </ul>
  Check the <b>Prompt</b> class for a useful input method.
  You should also make good use of cascaded method calls in your solution
    (taking the place of subexpressions and operator precendence).
  <p>
  Submit your final program (test it on small numbers, and big numbers: numbers
    with tens or hundreds of digits).
  Finally, remember to update the <b>Description:</b> comment to describe
    the changes added to the program.
  <p>
  PS: With a perfect understanding of <b>BigInteger</b> converting this program
    would take about 5 minutes: I guess you will take longer, because you will
    learn a lot about the <b>BigInteger</b> class, specifically, and
    understanding how to use objects, generally.

<!-- Dice War -->

<td width ="80%">
  This program requires you to use objects constructed from the
     <b>DiceEnsemble</b> and <b>Timer</b> classes; remember to import them.
  Write a program that simulates playing games of dice war; the program should
    also collect certain statistics while it is playing these games and report
    them after the required number of games have been played.
  In a game of dice war, each player starts out with his/her own dice ensemble,
    consisting of (2,6-sided) dice, and some number (entered by the user) of
    chips.
  Each player roles his/her dice.
  If one player's pip sum is higher, that player gets a chip from the other
    player.
  Whenever one player has no chips left, the game is over (and that player
    has lost; and the other player has won).
  So there are many plays (throws of the dice) in each game.
  <p>
  Your program must prompt the user for the number of games to play, and the
    number of chips with which the players start each game.
  It also prompts the user to determine if the program's behavior is to be
    traced (use tracing as a debugging technique, only when playing few games).
  The program then simulates that many games of dice war, using objects
    constructed from the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> class: one pair of dice for each
    player.
  It keeps track of the number of times each player wins, the length (number of
    dice rolls) of the shortest and longest games, and the total number of dice
    rolls (over all the games).
  It also uses a <b>Timer</b> to keep track of how long (in clock-time) it
    takes to play all the games.
  Try to use the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> objects themselves to keep track of some
    of the required information, so you do not have to declare extra variables.
  <p>
  Ultimately the program prints 
  <ul>
    <li>how often each player won (it is a fair game, so these
           numbers should be about equal)
    <li>the length of the shortest and longest games
    <li>the total number of rolls (over all games)
    <li>the average number of rolls per game
    <li>the amount of time it took to simulate all the games
    <li>the simulation speed (number of games per second)
  </ul>
  Finally, the program should also be capable of tracing its events.
  Such a facility is not used for long simulations, but instead it is very
    useful for short debugging runs.
  By tracing every important event in the simulation, we can display
    information useful for spotting bugs.
  When you build your program, you should trace the following events (if the
    user requests a trace)
  <ul>
    <li>starting a new game
    <li>playing one roll: indicate what each player rolled and how many chips
          each player has left after the roll (and redistribution of the
          chips).
     <li>winning a game
 </ul>
  Run my executable with tracing (for a small number of games), with each
    person starting out with 3-5 chips) and without tracing (for a large
    number of games, with increasing number of starting chips) to observe
    all its behavior.
  <p>
  For this assignment, try to work out your own enhancements.
  A starting point could be writing a program to play one game (with the user
    supplying the number of starting chips); then add tracing; then add playing
    multiple games (with the user supplying the number); then add code for
    keeping all the statistics; then add timing the game.
  Explore the Javadoc of the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> and <b>Timer</b> classes, and
    use them effectively to minimize the variables and code you must write.
  I found <b>Integer.MAX_VALUE</b> (check out this <b>static final</b> field in
    the <b>Integer</b> wrapper class in Javadoc) useful as an initialization
    for computing the smallest-length game, although there are many other
    ways to compute this value correctly.

  This program requires you to use objects constructed from the
     <b>TypedBufferReader</b> and <b>StringTokenizer</b> classes
     (as well as use of the <b>EOFException</b> class); remember to import
     them.
  <p>
  Write a program that reads a database of names and their associated phone
    numbers (from a file, catenating them into one huge <b>String</b>).
  As a debugging check (leave it in your program; it is in my executable too),
    ask the user if he/she wants to print the database (to see if it has been
    read correctly); if so, print the <b>String</b>.
  Then, it repeatedly prompts the user for a name (again, a <b>String</b>)
    and look up and print its associated phone number (or print that the name
    cannot be found) in the database.
  If the user enter the "name" <b>QUIT</b>, whether upper-, lower-, or
    mixed-case, the program should instead terminate.
  <p>
  Your program must prompt the user for an input file (see the file
    <b>phoneinput.txt</b> provided with the executable) and then read all the
    names and phone numbers from that file (each is read as a <b>String</b>)
    from that file, catenating them into one large database string (with a
    space between every name and phone number).
  Then your program should repeatedly prompt the user for a name, and terminate
    if the user enters <b>QUIT</b>; if the user enters any other name, use a
     loop to process a <b>StringTokenizer</b> object (initialized to the
     database): it should process tokens until the name is found (use a
     case-insensitive equality comparison; then the next token is the phone 
     number) or there are no more tokens (then the name was not in the
     database).
  <p>
  Note that the <a href="../../programs/classexamples.zip">Class Examples</a>
    program illustrates how to read all the values from a file, and how to
    process all the tokens in a <b>String</b>; study this code and adapt it to
    this program.
  This resulting program is pretty small; it requires file reading (see above),
    and ensures that you understand how to use the <b>StringTokenizer</b>
    class (which has a constructor and a few useful methods that you must
    learn to use).

<!-- Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator -->

  Write a program that simulates the working of an 
    <a href="http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/5951/5951.html" target="_blank">
      Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator</a> (ICD).
  An ICD is a small electronic device placed in the chest cavity of a patient
    who is suffering from arrhythmias (heartbeat irregularities).
  This device constantly monitors the electrical output of a beating heart:
    if it detects a bradycardia (heart beating too slowly) it acts a pacemaker;
     more importantly, if it detects a tachycardia (heart beating too fast to
     pump blood effectively: in extreme cases this results in  ventricular
     fibrillation) at which point it acts as a defibrillator by supplying a
     large shock to the heart in an attempt to restore a normal rhythm.
    This shock is described by patients as feeling like a kick in the chest
      -although many patients are unconscious by the time action is taken on
     the detected arrhythmia.
  If you are interested, you can read more detailed information on 
   <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/implantable_cardiac_defibrillator/article.htm" target="_blank">
    ICDs</a>.
  <p>
  The basic algorithm inside an ICD computes the zero-crossing count (ZCC) of
    the electical signals it samples while it is monitoring a heart.
  Each signal should be between the value of <b>-100</b> and <b>+100</b> 
    inclusive (if not, the ICD is receiving faulty signals, and it should shut
    itself off).
  During an interval (typically lasting a few seconds), whenever the signal
    value goes from positive to negative or negative to positive, the ICD
    increments its ZCC.
  For the purposes of this assignment, we will treat 0 as a positive number.
  At the end of an interval, the ICD checks to see whether its ZCC is within a
    normal range: in a bradycardia the ZCC is too low (equals or falls below
    some threshold); in a tachycardia the ZCC is to high (equals or exceeds
    some threshold).
  If the ICD detects either of these conditions it takes the necessary action;
    then it resets the ZCC and samples the heart signals for another interval.
  Of course, real ICDs have evolved to exhibit much more sophisticated
    behaviors, but this simple model is good enough for this programming
    assignment.
  <p>
  For example, if the ICD is using an interval length of <b>10</b>, the
    following table labels each sample, shows the signal value for that sample,
    and the current ZCC.
  <b><pre>Sample# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ...
Signal  0  5 10  5 -5  5 10  5 -5 -5  5 10  5 -5  5 -5 10  5 -5  5  5 10 ...
ZCC     0  0  0  0  1  2  2  2  3  3  1  1  1  2  3  4  5  5  6  7  0  0 ... 
ZCC reset to 0----------------------^-----------------------------^----- ...</pre></b>
  For example, between sample #4 and #5, the signal goes from <b>-5</b> to
    <b>5</b> so the ZCC is incremented.
  The ZCC at sample #10 (the end of the first interval) is <b>3</b> (after
    which it is reset to <b>0</b> but immediately incremented to <b>1</b>
     because between sample #10 and #11 the signal goes from <b>-5</b> to
     <b>5</b>); at the end of the second interval it has risen to <b>7</b>.
  <p>
  This program will simulate the simple ICD algorithmg, allowing us to test it
    on various data files that represent samples taken of the actual
    electrical signals of a monitored heart.
  It should operate as follows
  <ul>
    <li>Prompt the user for the name of the ICD's configuration data file
         (an input file), and the name of the simulated heart data file to
         monitor (an input file).<br>
        The configuration file specifies three <b>int</b> values: an example
          would look like <b>100 15 25</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>The interval length: how many signals to read from the data file
                while computing each ZCC; after these many signals, the ICD
                decides if the heart is arrythmic and resets the ZCC.
              It continues reading more signals, deciding whether or not the
                heart is arrythmic every interval length.
          <li>The bradycardia threshold: if the ZCCs in a an interval equals or
                falls below this threshold, the heart is beating too slowly.
          <li>The tachycardia threshold: if the ZCCs in an interval equlas or
                exceeds this threshold, the heart is beating too quickly.
        </ul>
        The simulated heart file contains a sequence of electical signals that
           the ICD should process.
    <li>Display on the console the information extracted from the configuration
          file; if these three values cannot be read correctly,
          (see the <b>simplebad1-config.txt</b> and
           <b>simplebad2-config.txt</b> files)
          the program should terminate.
    <li>Simulate the action of the ICD: read signals from the simulated heart
          file and compute the ZCC for each interval; display the ZCC for that
          interval, along with any action to take if the ZCC indicates an 
          abnormally beating heart.
    <li>Continue this process until
        <ul>
          <li>There is no more data in the simulated heart file
          <li>A bad signal value is read: smaller than <b>-100</b> or greater
                than <b>+100</b>
        </ul>
  </ul>
  Before starting to write your program, run my exectable on all the different
    data files that I've supplied (see the executable download), to
    familiarize youself with its operations, output messages, etc.
  Then, follow the iterative enhancement approach when writing this program.
  It is an excellent idea to add comments as you are writing the code, to help
    you understand it while you are enhancing it.
  <p>
  Initially, test your enhancements on the <b>simple-config.txt</b> and
    <b>simple-heart.txt</b> data files (they use the data illustrated above)
  Eventually test your enhancements using <b>regular-config.txt</b> and
    each of the <b>regular-</b> input files.
  <ol>
    <li>Write a kernel program that prompts the user for the name of the
          configuration file, reads all the data that it contains, and then 
          displays it on the console.
        Place all this code in to one large <b>try</b>-<b>catch</b> statement:
          if you cannot successfully read all the required values, catch any
          exception, then print an error message, and terminate the program.
        Test it on a good file (<b>simple-config.txt</b>) and two bad ones
          (<b>simplebad1-config.txt</b> and <b>simplebad2-config.txt</b>).
    <p>
    <li>Enhance the program so that it also prompts the user for the name of
          the heart data file too, reads and displays every value in this file
          (prefaced by the sample number: <b>1</b> for the first signal,
           <b>2</b> for the next, etc.), terminating the program when it
          unsuccessfully tries to read a data value from the file (e.g., it
          tries to read a non-integer value or it tries to read another value
          when there is none).
        Hint: this is the only loop that your program needs, and it should
          include another <b>try</b>-<b>catch</b> statement that handles any
          thrown exception by printing a message and terminating the
          loop/program.
        Test it using <b>simple-config.txt</b> and one a good file
          (<b>simple-heart.txt</b>) and a bad one (<b>simplebad1-heart.txt</b>).
    <p>
    <li>Enhance the program so that it also terminates the loop if the
          signal value is not between -100 and 100 inclusive, displaying
          the appropriate message.
        Test it using <b>simple-config.txt</b> and two bad files
          (<b>simplebad2-heart.txt</b> and <b>simplebad3-heart.txt</b>).
    <p>
    <li>Enhance the program so that it displays on the console the message
          <b>Make Decision</b> after reading enough sample signals to fill the
               interval.
        For example, if the interval is <b>10</b> samples, the ICD should read
           and display the first <b>10</b> signals (numbered <b>1</b> through
           <b>10</b>) and then display <b>Make Decision</b>; then it should
            read and display the second <b>10</b> signals (numbered
            <b>11</b> through <b>20</b>) and then display <b>Make Decision</b>
            again, etc.
        Test it using <b>simple-config.txt</b> and <b>simple-heart.txt</b>.
    <p>
    <li>Enhance the program so that it computes and displays the ZCC after it
          reads each value from the heart data file.
        This change will require two variables: one storing the value of the
          <i>previous</i> signal and one storing the value of the
          <i>current</i> signal; the <i>current</i> value becomes the
          <i>previous</i> one at the end of each loop iteration.
        Initially (before the loop even starts), set the <i>previous</i> value
          to <b>0</b>.
        Each iteration of the loop reads a new value for <i>current</i> from
           the heart input file. 
        <p>
        Also change the <b>Make Decision</b> message to display the current
          ZCC (whose value it will actually use to check for bradycardia or
          tachycardia).
        Important: after each decision is made, the ICD should reset the ZCC
          to <b>0</b>, as it begins  computing the ZCC for the next interval
          of signals.
        <p>
        Test it using <b>simple-config.txt</b> and <b>simple-heart.txt</b>
          and compare the results to the table of values above.
        When you have verified that the right ZCC values appear in these
          messages, remove (or comment out) the code that displays each signal,
          and the ZCC for each new signal read.
        <p>
    <li>Enhance the program to display <b>Bradycardia Detected</b> if the ZCC
          equals or falls below the threshold read from the configuration
          file, and display <b>Tachycardia Detected</b> if the ZCC equals or
          exceeds the threshold read from the configuration file.
  </ol>
  Test the final program using <b>regular-config.txt</b> and each of the
     <b>regular-</b> input files.
