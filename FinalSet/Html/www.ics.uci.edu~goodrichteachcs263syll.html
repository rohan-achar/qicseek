<h2>General Course Information</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks,
one midterm exam, and a comprehensive final exam. The overall grade
will be determined 40% from homework, 20% from the midterm, and
40% from the final.
Group work on homeworks is permitted, but each student must
list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem. If a
student
turns in a solution without listing the others who helped produce
this
solution, this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
Late homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>
</li>

<li><b>Exam policy.</b>
Exam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration
is allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams will be
considered cheating.
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a 
failing grade in the class.
