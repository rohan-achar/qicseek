"<b>Type Evolution Support for Complex Type Changes</b>"</A>,
by Barbara Staudt Lerner in Technical Report 94-071, 
Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

Type evolution is a serious problem for programs that use persistent data. 
Type changes are required during software maintenance, but can make persistent 
data inaccessible.  Existing systems that support type evolution severely 
restrict the ways in which a type can be changed, thereby limiting what can 
be accomplished during maintenance. Tess is a system to automate type 
evolution for a collection of more complex type changes while providing 
a more natural editing environment for the programmer. Tess uses a 
comparative approach to identify type changes rather than a specialized 
editing process.  Experimental results on real data indicate that Tess can 
accurately identify more complex type changes than those supported by 
existing systems relying on specialized editing.
