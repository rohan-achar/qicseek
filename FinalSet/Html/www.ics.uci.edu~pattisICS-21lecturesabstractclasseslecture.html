  In this lecture we will continue our discussion of inheritance features by 
    examing <b>abstract</b> classes.
  Once again, in many ways abstract classes are a simple concept (involving
    only one new keyword that can be used in two places) that has deep
    ramifications when designing complex class hierarchies.
  We will discuss this Java language feature in the context of the
    <a href="../../programs/positionalshapedemo.zip">
      Positional Shape Inheritance Demo</a>, which you should
      download, run, and examine.
  In this lecture we will compare abstract classes to interfaces (which seem
    closely related: for example we can extend interfaces via inheritance too)
    and see multiple ways to accomplish approximate the same result -and 
    compare them.
  Finally, we will examine some general principles for designing classes in
    inheritance hierarchies..

<td width ="20%"><b>Defining Abstract Methods and Classes</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Sometimes a class should define a method that logically belongs in the class,
    but that class cannot specify how to implement the method.
  For example, the <b>Shape</b> class is used as a superclass for 2-dimensional
    shapes (like circles, rectangles, etc).
  Logically, every shape should have a <b>getArea</b> method, because every
    shape has an area.
  But, every shape would compute its area using a different formula, and there
    is no way to specify one <b>getArea</b> method in the <b>Shape</b> class
    that is correct for all its possible subclasses.
  <p>
  In an application, we might want to declare a <b>Shape</b> array, fill it
    with references to objects constructed from actual shapes (subclasses of
    <b>Shape</b>), and then ask each shape to return its area.
  We would like Java to call the correct <b>getShape</b> method for each object
    to compute the result correctly; again, this illustrate how Java implements
    polymorphism to solve such a problem.
  <p>
  We accomplish this in Java by defining the <b>getArea</b> method in the
    <b>Shape</b> class, but by specfying the <b>abstract</b> keyword in its 
    list of access modifiers (as a syntax constraint this keyword can be used
    when defining only classes and methods) and then specifying no
    implementation (no method body, just like in an interface).
  We would specify it in the <b>Shape</b> class as follows
  <pre><b>  public abstract double getArea();</b></pre>
  By defining this method, we are telling the Java  compiler that it should
    allows us to call the <b>getArea</b> method using any variable declared
    with the type <b>Shape</b>, or declared with any class that is a subclass
    of <b>Shape</b> (where the definition of <b>getArea</b> will really
    appear).
  For example, we can define the <b>toString</b> method in the <b>Shape</b>
    class as

  <pre><b>  public String toString( )
  {return "Shape[id="+id+",area="+getArea()+"]";}</b></pre>

  This method calls <b>getArea</b> and returns (as a <b>String</b>) the area of
    the shape.
  Our first big rule about using <b>abstract</b> concerns where abstract
    methods can be called.
  <ol>
    <li>Any method in a class can be declared <b>abstract</b>.
        Such a method has no body (<b>{...}</b> is replaced by just <b>;</b>,
          as in interfaces) and can be called in other methods defined in that
          class, or be called in methods defined in any of its subclasses, or
          be called using any variables whose type is this class or any of its
          subclasses.  
  </ol>
  <p>
  Our second big rule about using <b>abstract</b> concerns the relationship
    between abstract method and the classes in which the are defined.
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      If a class defines any abstract methods (or, as we will see, inherits
        any abstract methods and doesn't override them), that class must be
        defined using the <b>abstract</b> keyword in its access modifiers.
  </ol>
  If this second rule is violated, the Java compiler will detect and report an
    error, so if we forget to make a class abstract, Java will just remind us
    with no harm caused..
  <p>
  In fact, we will define the <b>Shape</b> class (using an <b>id</b> instance
    variable and constructor) throughout the examples in this lecture as
  <pre><b>  public abstract class Shape {

    public Shape (String id)
    {this.id = id;}

    //This abstract method must be defined in a concrete subclass.
    //Note that it is called in this class in the toString method.
    public abstract double getArea();

    public String getId()
    {return id;}
    
    public String toString( )
    {return "Shape[id="+id+",area="+getArea()+"]";}

    private String id;
  }</b></pre>
  Generally, abstract classes can specify all the standard class components:
    constructors, methods, and instance variables.
  Again, a class must be defined with the keyword <b>abstract</b> (as is the
    case above) if any of its methods is defined with the keyword
    <b>abstract</b> (as is the case above).
  Note that we can call the <b>abstract</b> method in other methods defined in
    the class, even if its body isn't defined yet.
  <p>
  Again, logically this method belongs in the class, even if it cannot
    be written there (because <b>Shape</b> is too high in the hierarchy).

<td width ="20%"><b>Using Abstract Classes (as Superclasses)</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Now, it should be  obvious that it would make no sense to write
  <pre><b>  Shape s = new Shape("s1");
  System.out.println(s);</pre></b>
  because although we are allowed to call the <b>getArea</b> method (Java
    knows the prototype of this method), its implementation
    HAS NOT BEEN SPECIFIED.
  Java would have no idea what code to execute to compute <b>getArea</b>
    inside <b>toString</b>.
  <p>
  But the problem is not in the method call, it is in the construction.
  This issue brings us to our third big rule about using <b>abstract</b> for
    classes, concerning the restriction on calling constructors ONLY IN
    SUBCLASSES.
  <ol start ="3">
    <li>
    If a class is defined with the keyword <b>abstract</b>, we may call its
      constructor only via <b>super</b> in a class that extends it, not
      via the <b>new</b> operator.
    That is, we cannot explicitly construct an object using an <b>abstract</b>
      class, but we can use it to help construct an object from a subclass.
  </ol>
  Thus the Java compiler would detect and report an error in the statement
    <b>Shape s = new Shape("s1");</b> and never even get to compiling the
    call to the <b>getArea</b> method.
  <p>
  If we cannot construct an object with an abstract class, what can we do with
    one?
  We can definine a subclass that extends it.
  If the subclass overrides every abstract method that it inherits, then that
    subclass is not abstract.
  But, if it inherits any abstract methods and doesn't override them, then the 
    subclass also has abstract methods and must itself also be defined
    abstract.
  We call a "non-abstract" class concrete, although there is no keyword with
    this name.
  <p>
  For example, we can define a concrete <b>Circle</b> subclass by extending
    <b>Shape</b> as follows
  <pre><b>  public class Circle extends Shape {

    public Circle (String name, double r)
    { 
      super(name);
      radius = r;
    }
    
    //Overide the abstract method declared in shape
    public double getArea()
    {return Math.PI * radius * radius;}
    
    public double getRadius()
    {return radius;}
    
    public void setRadius(double newRadius)
    {radius = newRadius;}
    
    public String toString( )
    {return "Circle["radius="+radius+","+super.toString()+"];}

    private double radius;
  }</b></pre>
  Here the <b>Circle</b> subclass does override the one abstract method
    that it inherits from <b>Shape</b>; it defines a few new methods, but none
    of them is abstract; so, it is a concrete class -and therefore not defined
    with the <b>abstract</b> keyword.
  Also notice that its constructor must be supplied a radius that is stored in
     an instance variable in this class, and is used to compute the area.
  As we described above, although we cannot constuct a new object from the
    class <b>Shape</b>, we can call the constructor for this class
    <b>inside</b> the constructor for a subclass (as the <b>Circle</b> class
    does with its call of <b>super(name);</b> in its constructor).
  <p>
  Because the <b>Circle</b> class is concrete, we can construct new objects
    from this class.
  So, we can write

  <pre><b>  Circle c = new Circle("c1",1.0);
  System.out.println(c.toString());  //or just ...(c);</pre></b>

  Which will print
    <b>Circle[radius=1.0,Shape[id=c1,,area=3.141592653589793]]</b>
  <p>
  In fact, we can even write
  <pre><b>  Shape s = new Circle("c1",1.0);    //Note the type
  System.out.println(s.toString());  //or just ...(s);</pre></b>
  <p>
  which prints exactly the same thing!
  Here is the reasoning.
  Both <b>Shape</b> and <b>Circle</b> define <b>toString</b> methods, Java
    allows us to call <b>toString</b> on such variables.
  In both cases the object to which <b>c</b>/<b>s</b> refer is constructed
    from the <b>Circle</b> class, so it is the method DEFINED IN THIS CLASS
    that is called.
  <p>
  Stop and think hard!
  Many students reason that since <b>s</b> is DEFINED to be of type
    <b>Shape</b> then calling <b>s.toString</b> calls the <b>toString</b>
    method defined in the <b>Shape</b> class.
  THIS IS INCORRECT THINKING!
  Recall that Java's rule say that the TYPE determines WHAT methods can be
    called, but the CLASS OF THE OBJECT determines WHICH method is called!
  This is polymorphism in action.
  <p>
  Of course, if we wrote <b>Shape s = new Circle("c1",1.0);</b> then we
    COULD NOT call <b>s.setRadius(2.0);</b> because the type <b>Shape</b>
    defines no <b>setRadius</b> method.
  But if we wrote <b>Circle c = new Circle("c1",1.0);</b> then we
    COULD call <b>c.setRadius(2.0);</b> because the type <b>Circle</b>
    does define this method.
  <p>
  Finally we learn our fourth, and last, big rule about using <b>abstract</b>.
  <ol start="4">
    <li>
     We can treat an abstract class as a superclass and extend it; its
       subclasses can override some or all of its inherited abstract methods.
     If through this overriding a subclass contains no more abstract methods,
       that class is concrete (and we can construct objects directly from it).
     If it still abstract, it too can be used as a superclass ... (until
       eventually a subclass of a subclass ... is concrete).
  </ol>
  <p>
  We can also easily define a simlar subclass for rectangles.
  <pre><b>  public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public Rectangle (String name, double w, double h)
    { 
      super(name);
      width  = w;
      height = h;
    }
    
    //Overide the abstract method declared in Shape
    public double getArea()
    {return width*height;}
    
    public double getWidth()
    {return width;}
    
    public double getHeight()
    {return height;}
    
    public void setWidthHeight(double newWidth, double newHeight)
    {
      width  = newWidth;
      height = newHeight;
    }
    
    public String toString( )
    {return "Rectangle["width="+width+",height="+height+",+super.toString()+"];}

    private double width, height;
  }</b></pre>
  Because the <b>Rectangle</b> class is also concrete, we can construct new
    objects from this class too.
  We can write, for example
  <pre><b>  Shape s = new Rectangle("r1",2.0,3.0); //Note the type
  System.out.println(s);</pre></b>
  Which will print
    <b>Rectangle[width=2.0,height=3.0,Shape[id=r1,area=6.0]]</b>
  <p>
  We can picture such an object using our standard notation.

  <p>
  Of course, it is very simple to add more shapes (square, triangle, etc.)
    to this hierarchy by extending the <b>Shape</b> class.
  Neither the <b>Shape</b> class, nor <b>Circle</b> and <b>Rectangle</b>
    need to know any information about such newly added shapes.
  <p>
  Now, lets look at a more complicated example: writing parts of a model
    class that uses arrays, abstract classes interfaces.
  Suppose that we wanted to store an array of ten object that were each
    constructed from subclasses of <b>Shape</b>.
  We could declare <b>Shape[] allShapes = new Shape[10];</b> and then
    initialize this array.
  Some member migh index circles and some rectangles.
  <p>
  Now assume that we want to find the two shapes that have the most similar
    area.
  We can do this by first sorting the shapes in this array by their areas
    (smallest to biggest).
  We can call <b>Arrays.sort</b> using the <b>allShapes</b> array and the
     following anonymous class (that implements the correct <b>Comparator</b>).
<b><pre>  Arrays.sort(allShapes,
    new Comparator () {
      public int compare(Object o1, Object o2)
      {
        double areaDiff = ((Shape)o1).getArea() - ((Shape)o2).getArea();
        if (areaDiff < 0)
          return -1;
        else if (areaDiff > 0)
          return +1;
        else return 0;
      }
    });</pre></b>
  Now we can scan the array to find the adjacent shapes that have the most
    similar areas.<br>
<b><pre>  int bestIndex  = -1;
  double minDist = Double.MAX_VALUE;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;allShapes.length-1; i++) {
    double newDist = allShapes[i+1].getArea()-allShapes[i].getArea();
    if (newDist < minDist) {
      bestIndex = i;
      minDist   = newDist;
    }</pre></b>
  Now, the minimum distance is between <b>bestIndex</b> and <b>bestIndex</b>+1.

<td width ="20%"><b>Doing Without Abstract Methods/Classes</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We can get close to the effect of declaring <b>abstract</b> methods and
    classes by doing the following.
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the word <b>abstract</b> from each method and class.
    <li>Implement each formerly <b>abstract</b> method by a stub.
         <ul>
           <li> If the method
          is <b>void</b> its body should be just <b>{}</b>; if its method
          returns some primitive value, return <b>0</b>, or <b>0.0</b>, or
          <b>'?'</b>, or <b>false</b>; and if its method returns some
          reference to an object, return <b>null</b>.
           <li> Or, just have each method throw
          <b>UnsupportedOperationException</b>; in either case the method
            does nothing useful.
         </ul>
    <li>Leave unchanged any methods in a subclass that overrides a formerly
          <b>abstract</b> method.
  </ul>
  Any compiling/working classes will still compile/work after these changes.
  They will execute identically.
  But other -not so good- things can also happen.
  <ul>
    <li>We can construct objects from the formerly <b>abstract</b> class; when
          calling their stub methods, bad results are returned.
    <li>We can extend the formerly <b>abstract</b> class, and forget to
          override its stub methods; when calling these methods, the usefuless
          results are also returned.
  </ul>
  In the latter case, which is an easy mistake of omission (or even one of
    misspelling), if we used <b>abstract</b> methods the Java compiler would
    detect and inform us that the subclass must be defined to be abstract
    because an abstract method was not overridden: typically this message
    doesn't really what it says; normally we fix the problem not by defining
    the class to be <b>abstract</b> but by adding/fixing the appropriate
    method(s).
  <p>
  The designers of Java felt that the possiblity of "messing up" in this way
    was too big, and introduced the keyword <b>abstract</b> into the language
    for the purposes explained above.
  Its purpose is much like <b>final</b> for variables: we can provide the
    compiler with extra information about our intent; if we do something
    inconsistant with this intent, we receive an error message from the Java
    compiler.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>The Positional Shape Hierarchy</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Let's now deal with a more complicated example of a positional shape
    inheritance hierarchy.
  It is illustrated below graphically; the superscript <b>A</b> is used to
    denote classes that are abstract.
  <p>
   <img src="images/positionalshape.gif"></image>
  <p>
  Here the root of the inheritance hierarchy is shown as the concrete
    <b>Object</b> class.
  The <b>Shape</b> subclass, defined exactly as shown above, extends this
    concrete superclass and introduces an abstract method (<b>getArea</b>),
    so it becomes abstract.
  The <b>PositionalShape</b> subclass, extends the abstract <b>Shape</b>
    superclass.
  <p>
  It defines a constructor that initializes one new instance variable, a
    <b>Point</b> (read its Javadoc in the standard Java library) that
    specifies the position of the center of the shape (an x,y coordinate)
    on a 2-dimensional plane.
  This class adds a few new methods that manipulate the position, and adds one
    additional abstract method that returns the <b>bounding box</b> of the
     shape
    (the smallest <b>Rectangle</b> in which the shape can be enclosed; 
    note, this class has the full name <b>java.awt.Rectange</b> and IS NOT
    the <b>Rectangle</b> class that we will define; read its Javadoc in the
    standard Java library).
  Finally, it adds one additional method that detects whether two shapes
    "may overlap" by checking for intersection in their bounding boxes: if
    the bounding boxes don't intersect, there is no possibility of an overlap.
  <p>
  So, this class must be abstract because it contains two abstract methods:
    it specifies <b>getBoundingBox</b> and also inherits (and doesn't override)
    <b>getArea</b>.
  Here is a complete the class.
<b><pre>  public abstract class PositionalShape extends Shape {

    public PositionalShape (String id, int centerX, int centerY)
    { 
      super(id);
      center = new Point(centerX,centerY);
    }
    
    //These abstract methods must be defined in a concrete subclass.
    public abstract Rectangle getBoundingBox();

    public Point getCenter ()
    {return center;}

    public double distanceTo (PositionalShape other)
    {return center.distance(other.center);}

    public void moveCenterTo (Point newCenter)
    {
      center.x = newCenter.x;
      center.y = newCenter.y;
    }

    public void moveCenterBy (int dx, int dy)
    {
      center.x += dx;
      center.y += dy;
    }

    public boolean mayOverlap (PositionalShape other)
    {return getBoundingBox().intersects(other.getBoundingBox());}
    
    public String toString ()
    {return "PositionalShape[center="+center+","+super.toString()+"]";}

    //Fields
    private Point center;
  }</pre></b>
<p>
Notice that although this class does not know how bounding boxes are
  constructed from <b>PositionalShape</b>  objects (that method is abstract),
  it defines a concrete <b>mayOverlap</b> method because it knows that the
  <b>getBoundingBox</b> method in any concrete subclass of
  <b>PositionalShape</b> is defined concretely.
Thus, just as the concrete <b>toString</b> method in the <b>Shape</b> class
  called the abstract method <b>getArea</b>, the concrete <b>mayOverlap</b>
  method in the <b>PositionalShape</b> class calls the abstract method
  <b>getBoundingBox</b>.
<p>
Finally, we can define the <b>Circle</b> subclass as follows.
Note that it is concrete: it extends the abstract <b>PositionalShape</b>
  class, and overrides both the <b>getArea</b> and <b>getBoundingBox</b>
  methods.
<b><pre>  public class Circle extends PositionalShape {

    public Circle (String name, int centerX, int centerY, double r)
    { 
      super(name,centerX,centerY);
      radius = r;
    }
    
    //Overide the abstract method declared in Shape
    public double getArea()
    {return Math.PI * radius * radius;}

    //Overide the abstract method declared in PositionalShapee
    public Rectangle getBoundingBox()
    {
      return new Rectangle( (int)(getCenter().x-radius),
                            (int)(getCenter().y-radius),
                            (int)(2*radius),
                            (int)(2*radius) );
    }
    
    public double getRadius()
    {return radius;}
  
    public void setRadius(double newRadius)
    {radius = newRadius;}

    public String toString( )
    {return "Circle[radius="+radius+","+super.toString()+"]";}

    //Fields
    private double radius;
  }</pre></b>
  The bounding boxes are specified by the coordinate of the shapes upper-left
   corner and its width and height.
  For a circel, here is a picture of its bounding box.

  Again, bounding boxes can detect whether two shapes "may overlap" by
    checking for an intersection: if the bounding boxes don't intersect,
    there is no possibility of an overlap; if they do intersect, the shapes
    must be examined more closely.
  This property is illustrated below.

If you have not already done so, download
  <a href="../../programs/positionalshapedemo.zip">
  Positional Shape Inheritance Demonstration</a> and run this driver
  program.
It contains all the code above, as well as the defintion of the
  <b>Rectangle</b> class.
Notice in the <b>Rectangle</b> class how we differentiate between the
  <b>Rectangle</b> class we are defining and the <b>java.awt.Rectangle</b>
  class that we are using to help define it: no import, full class name
  (prefixed by its package name).
<p>
Finally, notice that the <b>Shape</b> class defines a concrete
  <b>PromptForInformation</b> method, which is overridden (and called via
  <b>super</b>) in the <b>PositionalShape</b> class, which is again overridden
  (and called via <b>super</b>) in the <b>Circle</b> and <b>Rectangle</b>
  class (a lot like how <b>toString</b> is overridden/called in these same
  classes).
The result is that there is no checking <b>instanceof</b> or casting in the
  application.
This absence is always desired.
It ensures that if we add other subclasses of <b>PositionalShape</b> they
  will all work with this application; we must change only <b>get</b> in
  the application to allow it to return other subclasses.
<p>
If you are writing <b>instanceof</b>, you are probably not defining your
  classes correctly, making appropriate use of polymorphism.
For example, if you need to know whether a an object is drawn with only
  straight lines (a square, rectangle, polygon; not a circle or elipse),
  don't use <b>instanceof</b> to pick out the right classes.
Instead define <b>public abstract boolean drawnWithLines()</b> inside the
  <b>Shape</b> class and then override this method in each subclass.

<td width ="20%"><b>Inheritance and Interfaces</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
There is another interesting way to design the <b>Circle</b> and
  <b>Rectangle</b> classes through the use of inheritance of interfaces,
  combined with inheritance of classes/abstract classes.
To do so, we must first learn that we can use the keyword <b>extends</b> to
  specify that one interface extends another.
In fact, UNLIKE CLASSES, an interface can extend multiple interfaces
  (much like the way that a class can implement multiple interfaces; recall
  that a class can extend only one other class).
The use of subinterfaces and superinterfaces will appear immediately below,
  including the specification of a subinterface that extend multiple
  superinterfaces.
<p>
We will start by specifying two interfaces separately, <b>Shape</b> and
  <b>Position</b>, and then one interface that has the properties of
  both: <b>PositionShape</b>.
Notice that these interfaces include all the abstract and concrete
  methods defined in the <b>Shape</b> and <b>PositionalShape</b> CLASSES
  above (except <b>toString</b>, which is not needed, because every
  class -whether or not it implements these interfaces- inherits a
  <b>toString</b> method that it can override).
  <pre><b>  public interface Shape {
    public double getArea();
    public String getId();
  }

  public interface Position {
    public Point     getCenter    ();
    public double    distanceTo   (Position other);
    public void      moveCenterTo (Point newCenter);
    public void      moveCenterBy (int dx, int dy);
  }

  public interface PositionalShape extends Position,Shape {
    public Rectangle getBoundingBox();
    public boolean   mayOverlap    (PositionalShape other);
  }</pre></b>
Here, the <b>PositionalShape</b> (sub)interface inherits all the methods
  specified in the <b>Position</b> and <b>Shape</b> (super)interfaces,
  and specifies two new methods.
Why are these methods new here and not inherited from other interfaces?
It WOULD NOT make sense to specify <b>getBoundingBox</b> or <b>mayOverlap</b>
  in either individual interface, because the concepts of bounding boxes
  and overlaping shapes don't make sense when applied to just shapes without
  positions or just positions without shapes.
It makes sense to specify these methods only within interfaces combining
   both shape and position properities.
<p>
If we declare a variable using the <b>PositionalShape</b> interface,
  Java allows us to use such a variable to call methods from the <b>Shape</b>,
  <b>Position</b> and <b>PositionalShape</b> interfaces.
I guess that we could also call this interfaces <b>ShapelyPosition</b>,
  and this begins to get at the point.
There is no obvious reason to have <b>Shape</b> as the superclass and then
  extend it to <b>PositionalShape</b>; we could have <b>Position</b> as the
  superclass and then extend it to <b>ShapelyPositional</b>.
In the original design we needed to make an arbitrary choice: which is the
  subclass and which is the superclass; in this design we avoid making such
  a choice, developing each part on its own can combining them on equal terms.
<p>
Once we define these interfaces, we can define three "simple" classes
  that implement them; the last of these classes it implemented using the
  first two, and will be extended when defining the <b>Circle</b> and
  <b>Rectangle</b> classes.
First we define a class that implements the basic part of the
   <b>Shape</b> interface (all but the abstract method).
It cannot say that it <b>implements Shape</b> because it defines no
  <b>getArea</b> method.
<pre><b>  public class ShapeBasics {

    public ShapeBasics (String id)
    {this.id = id;}

    public String getId()
    {return id;}
  
    public String toString( )
    {return "ShapeBasics[id="+id+"]";}

    private String id;
  }</b></pre>
Next we similarly define the <b>PositionBasics</b> class.
It CAN say that it <b>implements Position</b> because it defines all
  the specified methods (the formerly abstract <b>getBoundingBox</b> method
  is not specified in the <b>Position</b> interface, but in
  <b>PositionalShape</b>).
Because we can, we do specify <b>implements Position</b>.
  <b><pre>  public class PositionBasics implements Position {

    public PositionBasics (int centerX, int centerY)
    {center = new Point(centerX,centerY);}
    
    public Point getCenter ()
    {return center;}

    public double distanceTo (Position other)
    {return center.distance(other.getCenter());}

    public void moveCenterTo (Point newCenter)
    {
      center.x = newCenter.x;
      center.y = newCenter.y;
    }

    public void moveCenterBy (int dx, int dy)
    {
      center.x += dx;
      center.y += dy;
    }

    public String toString ()
    {return "PositionBasic[center="+center+"]";}

    //Fields
    private Point center;
  }</pre></b>
Note one small change in the <b>distanceTo</b> method.
It now is implemented via
  <b>{return center.distance(other.getCenter());}</b> instead of
  <b>{return center.distance(other.center);}</b> because the <b>Position</b>
  parameter is an interface, and stores no instance variables for this method
  to access.
<p>
Finally, we define an abstract class that implements the basic part of the
   <b>PositionalShape</b> interface.
It is this abstract class that our concrete <b>Circle</b> and </b>Rectangle</b>
  classes will extend.
The <b>PositionShapeBasics</b> class constructs objects from the
  <b>ShapeBasics</b> and <b>PositionBasics</b> classes, and uses these
  objects whenever one of their methods is needed.
This is called <b>delegation</b>: one object uses another to implement a
  method.
<p>
Thus, this class defines many methods (all those in the <b>Shape</b>,
  <b>Position</b>, and <b>PositionalShape</b> interfaces), with most being
  concrete.
It also has the the same two (from the first design) abstract methods:
  <b>getArea</b> and <b>getBoundingBox</b>.
All the concrete methods are implemented by delegation, with one-line bodies
 that delegate the call to the right object.
Note that <b>mayOverap</b> can be defined concretely here, knowing that
  the <b>getBoundingBox</b> method will eventually be defined in a concrete
  subclass.
<b><pre>  public abstract class PositionalShapeBasics implements PositionalShape {

    public PositionalShapeBasics (String name, int centerX, int centerY)
    { 
      s  = new ShapeBasics(name);
      p  = new PositionBasics(centerX,centerY);
    }
  
    //These abstracts method must be defined in a concrete subclass.
    public abstract double    getArea();
    public abstract Rectangle getBoundingBox();
    
    public String getId()
    {return s.getId();}
    
    public double distanceTo(Position other)
    {return p.distanceTo(other);}
    
    public Point getCenter()
    {return p.getCenter();}
    
    public void moveCenterTo(Point newCenter)
    {p.moveCenterTo(newCenter);}
    
    public void moveCenterBy(int dx, int dy)
    {p.moveCenterBy(dx,dy);}
    
    public boolean mayOverlap(PositionalShape other)
    {return getBoundingBox().intersects(other.getBoundingBox());}
    
    public String toString( )
    {return "PositionalShapeBasics[s="+s+",p="+p+"]";}

    //Fields
    private ShapeBasics    s;
    private PositionBasics p;
  }</pre></b>
Any class extending the <b>PositionalShapeBasics</b> class in this design
  can do all the jobs of a class subclassing the <b>PositionalShape</b> class
  in the previous design.
A class like <b>Circle</b> is defined almostly identically: the only 
  difference is on the name of the class it extends (and my comments in
  the class).
Recall that by knowing <b>Circle extends PositionalShapeBasics</b> and
  <b>PositionalShapeBasics implements PositionalShape</b> Java deduces
  (and we don't have to write) that <b>Circle implements PositionalShape</b>.
<b><pre>  public class Circle extends PositionalShapeBasics {

    public Circle (String name, int centerX, int centerY, double r)
    { 
      super(name,centerX,centerY);
      radius = r;
    }
    
    //Implement the getArea method,
    //  specified in the Shape interface
    public double getArea()
    {return Math.PI * radius * radius;}

    //Implement the getBoundingBox method,
    //  specified inthe PositionalShape interface
    public Rectangle getBoundingBox()
    {
      return new Rectangle( (int)(getCenter().x-radius),
                            (int)(getCenter().y-radius),
                            (int)(2*radius),
                            (int)(2*radius) );
    }
    
    public double getRadius()
    {return radius;}
    
    public void setRadius(double newRadius)
    {radius = newRadius;}

    public String toString( )
    {return "Circle[radius="+radius+","+super.toString()+"]";}

    //Fields
    private double radius;
  }</b></pre>
With this hierarchy, we would picture a <b>Circle</b> object as follows.
Recall that the <b>PositionalShapeBasics</b> abstract class delegates
  all its methods to the objects referred to by either of its its instance
  variables.

<p>
So, what are the advantage to each design, given that by the time we
  construct <b>Circle</b> and <b>Rectangle</b> subclasses (and other similar
  ones) we do so identically.
As stated above, the second design is a bit more symmetrical.
But the first design is certainly easier to understand (2 abstract classes,
  2 concrete ones; vs. 3 interfaces, 4 concrete classes, and 1 abstract one).
There is a general design rule that says to prefer delegation to inheritance,
  because you can delegate using many classes but directly inherit from only
  one.
Other interfaces/classes can more easily be constructed to use properties
  of these interfaces/classes, and others like them.
In fact, the pattern used in the second solution, although more complicated,
  can be used more often to solve other similar (and not so similar) problems.
<p>
I think the bottom line is: GOOD DESIGN IS A HARD.
I DO NOT have a goal for this class that you can design elegant
  inheritance hierarchies.
I DO have a goal that given an inheritance hierarchy, you can quickly read,
  understand, and use it (extend classes it contains).
<p>
You can download this alternative code in
  <a href="../../programs/positionalshapedemo2.zip">
  Positional Shape Inheritance Demonstration #2</a> and run its driver,
  which is identical to the first one.
It contains all the code above, as well as the <b>Rectangle</b> class.

<td width ="20%"><b>General Comments on Inheritance</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
In the next lecture we will apply inheritance to acheive a more perfect
  understanding of exceptions.
It will introduce no new material.
<p>
In this section I'd like to make just a few observations about classes.
<ul>
<li>GOOD DESIGN IS A HARD.
Reread the last part of the previous section.
Don't try to fix a poor design by hacking it implementation; fix the design.
<p>
<li>There are two important relationships between classes: we must be
  be able to recognize and understand (and differentiate) them.
The <b>extends</b> mechanism is also know as the IS-A mechanism.
It is appropriate to use when the subclass IS-A slightly different (extended)
  class than its superclass.
The delegation mechanism is known as the HAS-A mechanism.
It is appropriate to use when an object from one class HAS-A object from 
  another class to help it do its work (remember state; implement behavior);
  this second object is stored as an instance variable in the first.
<p>
<li>The Liskov subsitution rule:
<blockquote><i>
If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for
   all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when
   o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.
</i></blockquote>
Paraphrased: If S it is a subclass of T, then everything you can do to an
  object from class T should also make sense (and have the same effect)
  for an object from class S.
<p>
An example that is often dragged out is circles and elipses.
Mathematicians want to say a circle is just a special kind of elipse,
  but the <b>setAxes(double x, double y)</b> method on elipses makes no
  sense to apply to a circle (since it has one radius, not a major/minor
  axis).
Likewise an elipse is not just a special kind of circle: the relationship
  between the radius of a circle and its area makes no sense when speaking
  about an elipses.
This, at a fundamental level, as appealing as it may be, a circle and an
  elipses are not IS-A related.
<p>
One could, for example, define the <b>Circle</b> and <b>Elipses</b> classes
  separately, and then implement the <b>Circle</b> class by delegating its
  behavior to an <b>Elipse</b> stored as an instance variable, ensuring that
  the major and minor axes are always the same.
This implementation technique, delegation, is common.
<p>
It has been asserted that most inheritance problems boil down to a
  variant of the circle/elipses scenario, if you are smart enough to
  spot it.
If you truly understand this reasoning, you will be able to apply it
  everywhere.
For example, should <b>SortedList</b> extend <b>List</b>: no, because
  we can perform many operations on a <b>List</b> that make no sense
  for a <b>SortedList</b>: we can call <b>insertFront</b> and <b>insertRear</b>
  on a <b>List</b> and the inserted value becomes the first/last value
  respectively in the <b>List</b>;  but, in a <b>SortedList</b>, we cannot put
  values in these places (when can put values in, but they move to their
  "naturally sorted" place).
But one could, for example, specify the <b>List</b> and <b>SortedList</b> class
  separately, and then implement the <b>SortedList</b> by delegating its
  behavior to a <b>List</b stored as an instance variable, ensuring that
  values are always stored in appropriate indexes.
<p>
So again, we see delegation (HAS-A relationships) are more common than
  inheritance (IS-A relationships) between classes.
<p>
<li>Generally, "Classes should be closed for modification but open for
      extension."
This means that once the specification and implementation of a class
  stabilizes, we should never change it; instead we can extend it with
  subclasses that behave similarly but not identically, if we need different
  state and behavior.
</ul>
Again, relationships among classes in a large system is a quite advanced
  topic.
We need lots of experience reading classes -noticing their designs and
  learning how to use them effectively- before we can start creating
  complicated designs.
<p>
Finally, <b>final</b> as an access modifier for class and methods in classes.
If a method in a class is prefaced by the <b>final</b> access modifier, it
   means that it cannot be overridden.
Likewise, if a class is prefaced by the the <b>final</b> access modifier, it
  means that it cannot be extended (thus, none of its methods can be
  overridden).
The <b>String</b> class is defined to be <b>final</b>.
</ul>

<!-- Abstract Rules Restated -->

<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Abstract Rules Review</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  To review, here are the four rules for using the <b>abstract</b> keyword,
    collected in one place.
  <ol>
    <li>Any method in a class can be declared <b>abstract</b>.
        Such a method has no body (<b>{...}</b> is replaced by just <b>;</b>,
          as in interfaces) and can be called in other methods defined in that
          class, or be called in methods defined in any of its subclasses, or
          be called using any variables whose type is this class or any of its
          subclasses.  
      <p>
 
    <li>
      If a class defines any abstract methods (or, as we will see, inherits
        any abstract methods and doesn't override them), that class must be
        defined using the <b>abstract</b> keyword in its access modifiers.
      <p>
 
    <li>
    If a class is defined with the keyword <b>abstract</b>, we may call its
      constructor only via <b>super</b> in a class that extends it, not
      via the <b>new</b> operator.
    That is, we cannot explicitly construct an object using an <b>abstract</b>
      class, but we can use it to help construct an object from a subclass.
    <p> 

    <li>
     We can treat an abstract class as a superclass and extend it; its
       subclasses can override some or all of its inherited abstract methods.
     If through this overriding a subclass contains no more abstract methods,
       that class is concrete (and we can construct objects directly from it).
     If it still abstract, it too can be used as a superclass ... (until
       eventually a subclass of a subclass ... is concrete).

  If you get stumped on any problem, go back and read the relevant part of the
     lecture.
  If you still have questions, please get help from the Instructor, a TA,
    or any other student.

<ol> 
<li>Does Java allow us to declare a class <b>abstract</b> even if it define and
      inherits no <b>abstract</b> methods?
    If so, what do you expect the properties of the class to be?

<li>Write the <b>ModularCounter</b> class from the previous lecture to

      operate on it.
<p>
<li>Explain how a subclass can overload an inherited method (not override it).
<p>
<li>Do you think that an abstract class can say that it implements an
