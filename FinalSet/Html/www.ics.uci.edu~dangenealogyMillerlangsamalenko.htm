I received your email regarding the Langsam family. I 
live in Melbourne Australia and my cousins are the 
Langsam family live in Sydney. I will be in contact with
them to see if they can communicate with you.

I will fill you in as much as I know, since my 
relationship is from the female side of the family. 
Clara Langsam (nee Rosenbaum) marrried to Walter Langsam
(died just over a year ago) -  children are 
Jackie (married to Wayne Black with two children 
	Kara and Jesse), 
Paul (married last year) and
Michelle (unmarried). 
Walter has a brother currently living in Sydney. Both
came to Australia after the holocaust from Germany.

Regards... Alex Lenko

Hi,

I passed on your previous messages but they have had their share of
misfortunes and some good news over the past few years so they may not have
been able to respond.

As far as I am aware, only Paul Langsam has an email, which I have yet to
get that.

Their history at present is:

	Walter Langsam (died 2 yrs ago from cancer) married to Clara (nee
Rosenbaum). Children:
	Michelle - approx lat 30s unmarried
	Jackie -mid 30s married to Wayne Black, children Jesse and Kara
	Paul - late 20s, just married to Gabby Solo, 4 mth old baby Benjamin Walter.

Walter has a living brother in Sydney I think he is called Albert but am
not sure. He has one son I think called Philip (married). The only further
information I can give you is this extract from the Sydney wihite pages
directory.

A E Langsam -18 Hood St., Miranda, NSW 2228	Ph: 61 2 9524 6685
Clara Langsam -13 Bellevue Rd., Belleview Hill, NSW 2023 Ph: 61 2 9386 0492
Paul & Gabby Langsam -33 Philip St., Bondi, NSW 2026 Ph: 61 2 9388 0360
P Langsam -Lot 7 328 Brownlow Crt., Wattle Grove, NSW 2173 Ph: 61 2 9825 4723 

I hope this is of use.

Have a good new year.
