<TD><FONT COLOR="#000000">The request's Method must be INDEX. The Protocol must be HTTP/1.0. The Request-URI must correspond to the location of the resource which is requested to be indexed. </FONT> <P>The Request Header Fields may include the following header:</P> 

<UL>
<P><B>Content-Index</B> specifies a template for the index to follow, in order to include additional properties in the index response. For instance, including the following header with an index request:</P> </UL>

<UL>
<P><TT>Content-Index: &quot;filename&quot; &quot;content-type&quot; &quot;checked-in&quot;</TT></P> </UL>

<P>Instructs the server to return an index of the resources in the specified directory, listed with the resource's filename, content type, and its checked-in status. The client may request a list of available properties (to be included in a subsequent index request) by including the Content-Index header without any property values.</P>

<TR>
<TD>Response</TD>

<TD>If the server is able to index the given resource, it must return the following <I>Status-Code</I> in the <I>Status-Line</I> of its response: 

<UL>
<LI><B>200 OK</B>. This indicates that the response which follows contains a listing of objects contained in the specified resource, as well as their properties.</LI>
</UL>

<P>A successful response must include the following <I>Entity Header Field</I>:</P> 

<UL>
<LI><B>Content-type</B> must be set to the constant <B>text/plain</B>.</LI> </UL>

<P>The <I>Entity-Body</I> must consist of a series of lines, in ASCII&nbsp;text. Each line corresponds to a resource within the resource being indexed.</P> 

<P>If the request header <B>Content-Index </B>is included in the request with property parameters, the BNF&nbsp;for this response is defined as follows:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>Entity-body = *(resource)</TT></P>

<P><TT>resource = [SP&nbsp;[&quot;]property[&quot;] ...]( LF | CRLF )</TT></P> </UL>

<P>The first line, <TT>template</TT>, indicates the template which the index will follow for returning properties along with the resource description. This template line should be identical to the requested template line, although it is not a strict requirement (for instance, if the client requests an invalid property). The client should use the response template line to determine property names. If the <TT>template</TT> line is omitted, the default attributes are assumed to be of the form:</P> 

<UL>
<P><TT>template &quot;filename&quot; SP &quot;content-type&quot; SP&nbsp;&quot;size&quot; SP &quot;last-modification&quot; CRLF</TT></P> </UL>

<P>Following the single optional <TT>template</TT> line are the series of <TT>resource</TT> lines, one for each resource.</P> 

<P>The defined properties include:</P>

<UL>
<P>filename = The name of the resource, encoded using the <I>URL&nbsp;encoding rules</I>. For more information, refer to <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc1945">RFC 1945.</A> </P>

<P>content-type = The <I>MIME&nbsp;type</I> of the specified resource. The special keyword <B>directory</B> is used to designate filesystem directories or their equivalents.</P>

<P>size = The size in octets of the resource. The server may choose to respond with a single hyphen character (<B>-</B>) if it does not know the size of the resource.</P>

<P>last-modification = The date of last modification of this resource, specified as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. The server may choose to respond with a single hyphen character (<B>-</B>) if it does not know the size of the resource.</P> 

<P>property = Any additional properties which the server chooses to include which represent meta-information about the resource.</P> </UL>

<P>For each<TT> </TT>property of a given <TT>resource</TT> which does not have a value, the value <TT>&quot;&quot;</TT> is returned.</P> 

<P>If the request header <B>Content-Index</B> is included in the request without any property parameters, such as in the case:</P> 

<UL>
<P><TT>Content-Index:</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Then the response consists of a file of type text/plain with a single line:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>[template [SP&nbsp;[&quot;]property name[&quot;] ...] (&nbsp;LF |&nbsp;CRLF&nbsp;)]</TT></P>

<P>Where the template includes the list of all property names available for indexing.</P>
