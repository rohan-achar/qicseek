<p><FONT   SIZE=6><B>Lab Assignment 1 </B></FONT>
</p>
<P><font  >This assignment is due at the end of lab on Friday, January 10.</font></P>
<P><font  ><strong>Preparation</strong></font> (Do this part individually, before coming to lab)</P>
<P><font  ><strong>(1)</strong> Do everything on the course refrence sheet (the syllabus) under the heading &quot;What to do this week to get started in ICS 31.&quot; This includes filling out the questionnaire at <a href="http://eee.uci.edu/survey/ics31.w14.q"><code>eee.uci.edu/survey/ics31.w14.q</code></a> and registering yourself at <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/"><code>checkmate.ics.uci.edu</code></a> and <a href="https://piazza.com/uci/winter2014/ics31"><code>piazza.com</code></a>. </font></P>
<P><strong>(2)</strong> Read through the Lab Work part of this assignment before you come to lab, to get an idea of what you'll be doing with your partner.</P>
<P><strong>(3)</strong> If you haven't already, read the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/pair.html">guidelines for pair programming</a>. They describe how you will be doing all your work in the lab. Pair programming is not as simple as just working together; there are specific roles and specific things each person needs to do.</P>
<P><strong>(4) </strong>We encourage you to talk with each other and help each other understand how to do the assignments. There are some limits, though; in particular, remember that knowing <em>how</em> to do it (when the quizzes and exams come, for example) is much more important than just putting down the answer. If you haven't already, read the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html">guidelines for collaboration and independent work</a>. You may also wish to read some general advice about <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/college.html">how to approach college work</a>; not all of the practices that served you well in secondary school will work well here.
</P>
<P><strong>(5)</strong> Read Chapter 1 of the Zyante e-text or Chapter 1 of the Perkovic textbook; they provide some background, including some issues we talked about in class.</P>
<P>These &quot;preparation&quot; sections of each assignment will include the reading in the texts and some exercises for you to try out as you read. This is all wrapped together in the Zyante e-text; you'll just do the activities as they show up. But you should do the same thing if you're using the Perkovic book: People learn best when they apply what they read as they go, so it's best to read the book with a computer at hand so you can type things in and try them out. There's always a big gap between thinking you understand something you read and actually being able to apply it. We expect these exercises to go quickly, but if you find yourself spending more than a couple of minutes on an exercise without making any progress, you should ask about it (on Piazza, probably) rather than continuing to spin your wheels unproductively. Note that this also means you should get started early, so that you'll have the time to get any questions answered.</P>
<P>[Zyante reading notes: Throughout the Zyante e-text there are windows (labeled &quot;Try&quot; with a number) with (partial) Python programs that you can run right in the e-text. You can recognize them because the code has a black background and there's a Play button (a white triangle on an orange square). These windows are a little bit awkward for programs that ask the user to type input, like Try 1.6.1: They require that all the input be typed in advance into a little box, before you run the program. You will probably find it easiest to copy the code from the black window and paste it into an IDLE window where you can edit it as necessary and run it as normal. In section 1.7, the authors indicate that runtime errors and logic errors are the same thing. They're not. A runtime error (or execution error) is detected by the system when it executes the code (after you click Run); typically it arises from the program specifying something impossible (dividing by zero, indexing a sequence out of bounds—asking for the 10th element of a 5-element list, trying to read from a nonexistent file).    A logic error isn't impossible; it's just wrong:  multiply by 2 instead of 20, use <code>&gt;</code> instead of <code>&gt;=</code>,  repeat a segment of code one time too many.  Syntax errors and runtime errors are frustrating for novices, but eventually they become no big deal for professional programmers.  On the other hand, all programmers introduce logic errors from time to time, the system gives no help (no direct help, at least) in identifying them, and thus they're the cause of the biggest debugging headaches.]</P>
<P>[Perkovic reading notes: In Chapter 1 on page 3, the author characterizes different career paths in computing. But he mis-characterizes work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) when he says, &quot;Artistic computer professionals design the interfaces that clients use to interact with an application.&quot; Designing interfaces is not primarily an artistic activity and many people who work in HCI have no particular artistic interest or ability. Instead, HCI designers are experimenters, observing how actual users perform when using a design and refining the design based on what they observe. UCI is a world leader in HCI research; ICS offers half a dozen undergrad courses in various aspects of HCI.]</P>
<P><strong>(6)</strong> Read sections 2.1–2.7 of the Zyante e-text or sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the Perkovic text. You don't have to do all of this by Wednesday, but we'll be talking about some of this material in class on Thursday.</P>
<P>As you're reading (in Zyante or Perkovic), it's important that you apply what you're reading; it's impossible to learn this material without actually working through it. Zyante provides interactive parts (animations, &quot;Try&quot; sections, question sets); Perkovic provides &quot;Practice Problem&quot; sections. You should try to do nearly all of these in whichever text you're using. Don't get stalled for a long time on any single question, but if you have trouble, ask someone.  Especially early in the course, it may seem tedious and slow because you're just learning your way. But the effort here will pay off in a greater facility later (or, to put it negatively, failing to do this now will result in disappointing performance later).</P>
<P>We don't require you to turn in your answers to these practice problems; most of the solutions are shown in Zyante and appear at the end of the chapter in Perkovic. But don't just read the problem, turn to the solution, and say, &quot;Yeah, that looks right.&quot; Write down your answer first; force yourself to work it through. That's how you learn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<p><font  ><strong>Lab Work</strong></font> (Do this part with your partner in lab)</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Choose a partner for this assignment and make sure the TA knows who your partner is. Remember that you'll choose a different partner for each lab assignment, so you'll work with this partner only on this assignment. Make sure you know your partner's name (first and last) and contact information (Email or cellphone or whatever) in case one of you can't make it to lab. 
 All your computer-based work on this (and every) lab assignment must follow the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/pair.html">pair programming guidelines</a>.
<p><strong>(b)</strong> It's especially important that you be able to receive electronic mail sent to your UCInet ID (<code>you@uci.edu</code>). You may redirect this mail to another account of your choosing, but don't let that mail go unread. <!--Redirecting is a good idea (the course reference sheet says how), since your UCI mailbox is small and when it fills up, messages sent to you get lost. -->
<p>With your partner, test this out by sending each other Email at your UCI addresses. There's nothing to turn in for this part.
<p><strong>(c)</strong> Locate and launch the IDLE software.
  
IDLE starts up with a &quot;Python Shell&quot; window where we'll see the results of most of our programs. IDLE also lets you open up a program window; do this now, by choosing &quot;New Window&quot; from the File menu. Give that window a name right away and save it, by choosing &quot;Save As&quot; from the file menu and specifying the name <code>lab1.py</code> . (You can save it anywhere on your machine; just don't forget where you put it and remember to recycle/discard it after you're done so that the next student on your lab machine doesn't use your work by mistake.)
<p>In your 
  <code>lab1.py</code> file, you can type <code>print</code> statements that contain expressions; when you run the  code in the file (choose &quot;Run Module&quot; from the Run menu or press the F5 key), the results are printed in the Python Shell window. Try it: Type <code>print('Hello')</code> in your <code>lab1.py</code> file and then run it. You should se<code>e Hello </code>
in the shell window.
<p>[It is also possible to type expressions, without the <code>print</code>, directly into the shell window after IDLE's &quot;prompt&quot; of three greater-than signs (&quot;<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>"). This behaves a little differently, though, and most beginners find it confusing, so for now we're going to type all our Python code in a code window and run it when we're ready.]
<p>Experiment with IDLE to get familiar with it, following the suggestions below. One person "drives" (types); the other "navigates" (observes, questions, suggests); if you don't know what this is about, go back and read the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/pair.html">pair programming guidelines</a>. The main point of this assignment is to get you familiar with the mechanics of IDLE, Python, and pair programming.
<p>Try printing the values of some expressions, like <code>print(123 + 456</code>) and <code>print(2 ** 5)</code> (<code>**</code> is the operator for exponents) and <code>print(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)</code>. 
<p>Type in some definitions, like <code>number_of_students = 598</code> and <code>number_of_staff = 18</code> and then try printing expressions like <code>number_of_students / number_of_staff</code>.


(That is, type the Python statement <code>print(number_of_students / number_of_staff)</code>. At this point we'll just say &quot;print the expresion X&quot; and you'll know to type the Python statement <code>print(</code>X<code>)</code> in your <code>lab1.py</code> file and then run it.)
<p>Probably you've already done this a few times: Type some things that Python can't evaluate and see what messages Python produces. (Error messages are not bad; they're an inevitable part of programming. Don't think of them as the computer yelling at you; it's just trying to tell you why it couldn't process something.  The language of error messages can be cryptic, but you will learn how to pick through them for useful clues to what Python thinks the problem is.)
<p>Save a copy of the Python Shell window that shows your work for this part (using Save a Copy As from the File menu). A good name for the file would be <code>lab1c.txt</code>; stick with a naming pattern like this for the rest of the quarter. It's fine if your interactions show false starts and mistakes; it's also fine if you just produce a short, clean copy. Edit the file to make sure it includes your name and your partner's at the top; when you're done with the assignment, this is one of the files you'll submit via Checkmate. (Don't know what Checkmate is? Look at the "What to do this week" section of the course syllabus).
<p>
<strong>(d)</strong> Switch roles now, if you haven't already, so the navigator can drive and vice versa. Don't worry if the new driver is less familiar with Python or IDLE than the first driver. Both will get more experienced rapidly.
<p>
As we mentioned briefly above, the Python shell window can be useful for testing out small things, but it doesn't save the code we type, so as our code gets longer and more involved, we need the technique we've already started using: We create a new window into which we can type Python code to save as a Python (<code>.py</code>) file. That's the way we'll be doing our work this quarter.
<p>The factorial function (written in mathematical notation with an exclamation point, so "n factorial" would be n!) is used in calculating how many ways there are to arrange things (like the number of different ways to arrange five students in a row). The value of n! is n · (n-1) · (n-2) · ... · 1, so 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120.
<p>Create a new window (from the File menu) and save it as  <code>lab1d.py</code>. On the first line of the file type a pound sign followed by the names and IDs of both partners and some other identifying information, like this: 
<pre>
 #  Paula Programmer 11223344 and Andrew Anteater 44332211.  ICS 31 Lab sec 7.  Lab Asst 1d.
</pre>
<p>Type the following function definition into your new window. Actually do the typing so you can get used to the way it works; don't just copy and paste. (We'll go over the details of this code in class some time soon; for now, this is just a typing exercise and you shouldn't try too hard to figure out how it works. If you're not used to typing programs, be careful to type accurately. In particular, the spacing at the beginnings of the lines matters in Python.) 
  Watch what happens every time you type a right-parenthesis, and watch what happens when you hit Return after typing a colon.
<pre>
def factorial (n: int) -> int:
    ''' Compute n! (n factorial) '''
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
assert factorial(0) == 1 
assert factorial(5) == 120 

print("10! is", factorial(10))
print("100! is", factorial(100))
</pre>
<p>
  When you're done, run the code (select Run Module from the Run menu or type the F5 key). Don't be surprised to get error messages; you've probably just mis-typed something, and programming languages are pickier than the pickiest human proofreader. Just use the messages to help you identify each typo until you get an error-free result.
<p>Now try changing the print statement(s) to print expressions like<code> factorial(120)</code>, <code>factorial(50 * 10)</code>, and <code>factorial(factorial(5))</code>. Re-run the code to see what the results are.</p>
<p>
Python can handle long numbers effortlessly, but any computer is finite; what do you think might happen if you evaluate <code>factorial(factorial(50))</code>? You can try it, but you'll have to stop the evaluation by selecting Restart Shell from the Shell menu.
<p>Make sure both partners' names are at the top of the Python file you typed, save that file, and submit it via Checkmate.

But before you submit it, run the file one last time. It should produce correct results. If it doesn't, correct the mistakes before you submit it. Whenever you submit a Python file in ICS 31, the file should produce correct results when you (or we) run it; you won't receive credit if it produces an error message.
<p><strong>(e)</strong> 
<!-- In the Python Shell in IDLE, type any expression, like <code>17 * 5</code>, and hit Return. The shell evaluates it and displays its value. Now type <code>print(17 * 5)</code> and evaluate it. You get the same value. (The book will get to Python's print statement a little later, but we're going to find it useful now.) </p>
<p>But try it with a string expression: Evaluate <code>'ics31'[2]</code>, then evaluate <code>print('ics31'[2])</code>. You get the same value, but without the quotation marks. When we're working on small pieces of our code directly in the Python interpreter (the Python Shell window), it doesn't matter much to us whether we see the quotes or not. But in a real program, we don't usually want quotes around our strings. We don't know quite enough yet to write complete programs, but as you work on the exercises in this assignment, you may want to type them into a Python file to edit and save them. If you type Python code into a Python file and run it (from the Run menu), you need to print expressions to see their values. </p>
-->In IDLE, create a new file and save it as <code>lab1e.py</code>. When you have your personal ICS lab account, save the file on your personal H: drive (or on a removable thumb drive). If you save it on the common C: drive, someone else might pick it up later (by mistake, we hope, but it would still lead to a lot of awkward questions about academic honesty). Keeping personal information secure is a real-world skill; people who work with health and other personal information can get in huge trouble if they leave personal information open to unauthorized access.
<p>On the first line of the file type a pound sign followed by the names and IDs of both partners and some other identifying information, like this: 
<pre>
 #  Paula Programmer 11223344 and Andrew Anteater 44332211.  ICS 31 Lab sec 7.  Lab Asst 1e.
</pre>
<p>Now put in a couple of print statements that print some expressions—any expressions—and run the code in the file. Once you have this working, continue with the rest of this assignment. Type your solutions to the rest of the lab into your  <code>lab1e.py</code> file, which you will submit via Checkmate. (It's a good idea if each partner keeps a copy of the lab work at the end of each session, just in case someone can't make it to the next lab.)</p>

  2.17 (a), (c), (d), and (e); Exercise 2.21.</p>
-->
<p><strong>(g)</strong> Done, and it's not Friday yet? Good for you! But you should know that the rest of the class will catch up to you and that later assignments will take everyone longer. And ask yourself: Are you sure that both you and your partner understand everything in this assignment? Could each of you re-solve each problem easily? Take this opportunity to make sure each of you has a solid foundation in the basics. If you like, try some of the problems at <a href="http://codingbat.com/python">Codingbat.com.</a></p>
<p><strong>(h) </strong>Remember that each partner must complete a partner evaluation form and submit it individually. Do this by connecting to the Google Forms URL you received by Email; you'll need to log in to your UCI Gmail account. The partner evaluation forms will typically be available on the day the lab is due.</p>
<p>Make sure you know your partner's name, first and last, so you can evaluate the right person. Please complete your evaluation by the end of the day on Friday, or Saturday morning at the latest. It only takes a couple of minutes and not doing it hurts your participation score. </p>
<p><strong>What to turn in:</strong> It would be an excellent idea to go back and re-read the assignment carefully now, to make sure you've completed all the steps specified. Then one member of each pair (not both!) must submit via Checkmate the files you created for parts (c), (d), (e) and (f) above; make sure both partners' names appear at the top of each file. Also remember that each student must complete a partner evaluation form; these evaluations contribute to your class participation score. Get in the habit of doing this every week on Friday after you've submitted your assignment; the survey closes on Saturday.
