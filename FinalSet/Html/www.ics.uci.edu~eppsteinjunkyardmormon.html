Unfortunately, history has that bit wrong. The doctrine was given by
the angel Voronoi, and concerned methods of drawing hyperplanes
equidistant from pairs of points in general location. Joseph Smith,
unfortunately, had just woken up and was too groggy to understand the
name correctly, besides having flunked CG. The angels Preparata and
Shamos were due for a visit too, but gave up after that episode.
