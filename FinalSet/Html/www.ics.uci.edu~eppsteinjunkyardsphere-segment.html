&gt;Choose points A,B,C,D independently and (uniformly) randomly on a unit sphere,

&gt;
&gt;I had given a slick proof that the answer is 1/8, by...
&gt;
&gt;(i) considering the placement of A &amp; B conditional on knowing their great
&gt;     circle; 
&gt;(ii) taking these to be uniform (&amp; independent) on the great circle;
&gt;(iii) showing the probability that short-arc AB contains a given point is 1/4;
&gt;(iv) looking at the intersection of circles AB &amp; CD, and deducing  1/8.
&gt;[...]

Actually the answer of 1/8 doesn't really require uniform distribution,
only a distribution invariant with respect to 180-degree rotation through
the center of the sphere.  The idea is that among the  16 points 
(+/- A, +/- B, +/- C, +/- D), exactly two correspond to "good"
configurations.  This is not hard to see in the probability 1 "generic"
case were A,B,C,D are distinct and no three of them lie on a great circle.
To make this argument completely rigorous one needs only the finite
additivity of the measure, that the non-generic cases have probability 0,
that the set of "good" cases *has* a measure, and that the measure be
invariant with respect to 180 degree rotation in any coordinate.
