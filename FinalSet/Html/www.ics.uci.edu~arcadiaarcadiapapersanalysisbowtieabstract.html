"<b>Integrating Testing Techniques with Process Programming</b>,"</A>
by Debra J. Richardson, Stephanie Leif Aha, and Leon J. Osterweil in

Analysis and Verification</i>,
pages 219-228, Keywest, December 1989.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

Integration of multiple testing techniques is required to demonstrate 
high quality of software.  Technique integration has four basic goals: 
reduced development costs, incremental testing capabilities, extensive 
error detection, and cost-effective application. We are experimenting with
the use of process programming as a mechanism for integrating testing 
techniques. Having set out to develop a process that provides adequate 
coverage and comprehensive fault detection, we proposed synergistic use 
of DataFlow testing and Relay to achieve all four goals. We developed a
testing process program much as we would develop a software product from 
requirements through design to implementation and evaluation. We found 
process programming to be effective for explicitly integrating the 
techniques and achieving the desired synergism. Used in this way, process 
programming also mitigates many of the other problems that plague 
testing in the software development process.
