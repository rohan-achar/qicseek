<h2>4 Oct 1996:<br>
Geometric Graph Coloring<br>
<a href="/~eppstein/">David Eppstein</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

I will talk about some problems in <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/color.html">geometric
graph coloring</a>. The most famous of these is the open
"Hadwiger-Nelson Problem" asking for the maximum chromatic number
of a graph that can be embedded in the plane so that all edges are
exactly one unit long. I'll also discuss some of my recent work on
coloring <a href=
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/lacolor/">line
arrangements</a> and quadtrees, and describe another open question
about <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/penrose.html">Penrose
tilings</a>.
