<b>Abstract</b><p>
<i>We describe Syskill &amp; Webert, a</i><b> </b><i>software agent that learns
to rate pages on the World Wide Web (WWW), deciding what pages might interest a
user.   The user rates explored pages on a three point scale, and  Syskill
&amp; Webert learns a user profile by analyzing the information on each page.
The user profile can be used in two ways.  First, it can be used to suggest
which links a user would be interested in exploring.  Second, it can be used to
construct a LYCOS query to find pages that would interest a user.   We compare
six different algorithms from machine learning and information retrieval on
this task. We find that the naive Bayesian classifier offers several advantages
over other learning algorithms on this task. Furthermore, we find that an
initial portion of a web page is sufficient for making predictions on its
interestingness substantially reducing the amount of network transmission
required to make predictions. </i><p>

<b>1 Introduction</b><p>
<b></b>There is a vast amount of information on the World Wide Web (WWW) and
more is becoming available daily.  How can a user locate information that might
be useful to that user?  In this paper, we discuss Syskill &amp; Webert, a
software agent that learns a profile of a user's interest, and uses this
profile to identify interesting web pages in two ways.  First,  by having the
user rate some of the links from a manually collected "index page" Syskill
&amp; Webert can suggest which other links might interest the user. Syskill
&amp; Webert can annotate any HTML page with information on whether the user
would be interested in visiting each page linked from that page. Second,
Syskill &amp; Webert can construct a LYCOS (Maudlin &amp; Leavitt, 1994) query
and retrieve pages that might match a user's interest, and then annotate this
result of the LYCOS search.  Figure 1 shows a Web page
(http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/subjects/ai_subjects.html) that has been annotated by
Syskill and Webert.  This web page is a subject listing of AI topics that
serves as an example of one index page.  In this case, the user has indicated
strong interest in "Machine Learning" and "Reinforcement Learning" (indicated
by two thumbs up), a mild interest in "Agents" (indicated by one thumb up and
one thumb down) and no interest in  "Business, Finance and AI" and "Philosophy
of AI' (indicated by two thumbs down).  The other annotations are the
predictions made by Syskill &amp; Webert about whether the user would be
interested in each unexplored page. A smiley face indicates that the user
hasn't visited the page and Syskill &amp; Webert recommends the page to the
user.   For this topic, these pages are "Neural Networks," "Evolutionary
Algorithms," "Bayesian Inference," "General AI," and "Case-Based Reasoning."
The international symbol for "no" is used to indicate a page hasn't been
visited and the learned user profile indicates the page should be avoided.
Following any prediction is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the probability
the user would like the page.  <p>

<p>
In this paper, we first describe how the Syskill &amp; Webert interface is used
and the functionality that it provides.  Next, we describe the underlying
technology for learning a user profile and how we addressed the issues involved
in applying machine learning algorithms to classify HTML texts rather than
classified attribute-value vectors. We describe experiments that compare the
accuracy of several algorithms at learning user profiles.   Finally, we relate
Syskill &amp; Webert  to other agents for learning on the Web.<p>
<p>
<b>2 Syskill &amp; Webert</b> <p>
<p>
Syskill &amp; Webert learns a separate profile for each topic of each user.  We
decided to learn a profile for user topics rather than users for two reasons.
First, we believe that many users have multiple interests and it will be
possible to learn a more accurate profile for each topic separately since the
factors that make one topic interesting are unlikely to make another
interesting. Second, associated with each topic is a URL that we call an
<i>index </i>page. The index page is a manually constructed page that typically
contains a hundred or more links to other information providers. For example,
the Web page at http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/all.html contains links to
over 400 sites on the topic of Biosciences. Syskill &amp; Webert allows a user
to explore the Web using the index page as a starting point.  In one mode of
using Syskill &amp; Webert,  it learns a profile from the user's ratings of
pages and uses this profile to suggest other pages accessible from the index
page. To collect ratings, the HTML source of users' pages is intercepted, and
an additional functionality is added to each page (see Figure 2).  This
functionality allows the user to rate a page as either hot (two thumbs up),
lukewarm (one thumb up and one thumb down), or cold (two thumbs down).  The
user can return to the index page or switch topics.  Furthermore, the user can
instruct Syskill &amp; Webert to learn  a user-profile for the current topic,
make suggestions or consult LYCOS to search the Web.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>
<IMG SRC="AAAI2.GIF"><b></b><p>
<b>Figure 2.</b> Syskill &amp; Webert interface for rating pages.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>When a user rates a page, the HTML source of the page is copied to a
local file<a href="AAAI_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> and a summary of the rating is
made.  The summary contains the classification (hot, cold, or lukewarm), the
URL and local file, the date the file was copied (to allow for the bookkeeping
that would occur when a file changes), and the page's title (to allow for the
production of a summary of the ratings).<p>
 Syskill &amp; Webert  adds functionality<a href="AAAI_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a> to
the page (see Figure 2) for learning a user profile, using this user profile to
suggest which links to explore from the index page, and forming LYCOS queries.
The user profile is learned by analyzing all of the previous classifications of
pages by the user on this topic.  If a profile exists, a new profile is created
by reanalyzing all previous pages together with any newly classified pages.<a
href="AAAI_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a><p>
Once the user profile has been learned, it can be used to determine whether the
user would be interested in another page.  However, this decision is made by
analyzing the HTML source of a page, and it requires the page to be retrieved
first.  To get around network delays, we allow the user to prefetch all pages
accessible from the index page and store them locally.  Once this has been
done, Syskill &amp; Webert can learn a new profile and make suggestions about
pages to visit quickly.  Section 5 discusses one means of avoiding a
significant amount of network transmission overhead.  Once the HTML has been
analyzed, Syskill &amp; Webert annotates each link on the page with an icon
indicating the user's rating or its prediction of the user's rating together
with the estimated probability that a user would like the page.  Following any
prediction is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the probability the user
would like the page.  The default version of Syskill &amp; Webert uses a simple
Bayesian classifier (Duda &amp; Hart, 1973) to determine this probability.
Note that these ratings and predictions are specific to one user and do not
reflect on how other users might rate the pages.<p>
As described above, Syskill &amp; Webert is limited to making suggestions about
which link to follow from a single page. This is useful if someone has
collected a nearly comprehensive set of links about a topic.  Syskill &amp;
Webert contains another feature that is useful in finding pages that might
interest a user anywhere on the Web (provided the pages have been indexed by
LYCOS).  The user profile contains information on two types of words that occur
in pages that have been rated.  First, it contains words that occur in the most
number of pages that have been rated "hot."  For these words, we do not
consider whether they have also occurred in pages that have other ratings.
However, we ignore common English words and all HTML commands.  The second set
of words we use are those whose presence in an HTML file helps discriminate
pages that are rated hot from other pages.  As described in Section 3, we use
mutual information to identify discriminating words. Since LYCOS cannot accept
very long queries, we use the 7 most discriminating words that are found in a
higher proportion of hot pages than all pages and the 7 most commonly occurring
words as a query.  Experimentally, we have found that longer queries
occasionally exhaust the resources of LYCOS.  The discriminating words are
useful in distinguishing pages of a given topic but do not describe the topic.
For example (see Figure 3) the discriminating words for one user about the
Biosciences are "grants," "control," "WUSTL," "data," "genome," "CDC,"  and
"infectious." The common words are useful for defining a topic. In the example
in Figure 3 these are "university," "research," "pharmacy," "health,"
"journal," "biology,"  and  "medical." <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>
<IMG SRC="AAAI3.GIF"><b></b><p>
<b>Figure 4. </b> Syskill &amp; Webert constructs a LYCOS query from a user
profile.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>A strength of LYCOS is that it indexes a large percentage of the Web and
can quickly identify URLs whose pages contain certain keywords.  However, it
requires a user to filter the results.  Syskill &amp; Webert can be used to
filter the results of LYCOS (provided the pages are fetched).  For example,
Figure 4 shows part of a LYCOS result that has been augmented by Syskill &amp;
Webert to contain a recommendation against visiting one page and for visiting
others.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>3. Learning a user profile. </b><p>
Learning algorithms require a set of positive examples of some concepts (such
as web pages one is interested in) and negative examples (such as web pages one
is not interested in). In this paper, we learn a concept that distinguishes
pages rated as hot by the user from other pages (combining the two classes
lukewarm and cold, since few pages are rated lukewarm, and we are primarily
interested in finding pages a user would consider hot).  Most learning programs
require that the examples be represented as a set of feature vectors.
Therefore, we have constructed a method of converting the HTML source of a web
page into a Boolean feature vector. Each feature has a Boolean value that
&#29;indicates whether a particular "word" is present (at least once) or absent
in a particular web page.  For the purposes of this paper, a word is a sequence
of letters, delimited by nonletters.  For example, the URL &lt;A HREF=
http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/all.html&gt; contains nine "words"  a, href,
http, golgi, harvard, edu, biopages, all, and html.  All words are converted to
upper case.  <p>
Not all words that appear in an HTML document are used as features.  We use an
information-based approach, similar to that used by an early version of the
NewsWeeder program (Lang, 1995) to determine which words to use as features.
Intuitively, one would like words that occur frequently in pages on the
hotlist, but infrequently on pages on the coldlist (or vice versa).  This is
accomplished by finding the expected information gain (<i>E(W,S)</i>) (e.g.,
Quinlan, 1984) that the presence or absence of a word (<i>W</i>) gives toward
the classification of elements of a set of pages (<i>S</i>):<p>
<IMG SRC="AAAI4.GIF"><p>
where <p>
<IMG SRC="AAAI5.GIF"><p>
and <i>P(W=present) </i>is the probability that <i>W</i> is present on a page,
and 
<IMG SRC="AAAI6.GIF">is
the set of pages that contain at least one occurrence of <i>W</i>  and  
<IMG SRC="AAAI7.GIF">
are the pages that belong to the class <i>c</i>.<p>
Using this approach, we find the set of <i>k</i> most informative words. In the
experiment discussed in Section 4, we use the 128 most informative words.
Section 6 discusses the impact of selecting other values for <i>k</i>.  Table 1
shows some of the most informative words obtained from a collection of 140 HTML
documents on independent rock bands.  <p>
<p>

<p>
Once the HTML source for a given topic has been converted to positive and
negative examples represented as  feature vectors, it's possible to run many
learning algorithms on the data.  We have investigated a variety of machine
learning algorithms.  In addition, we compare our results to TF-IDF, an
weighting strategy from information retrieval adapted to perform the task of
classification.<p>
<b>3.1 Bayesian classifier</b><p>
<b></b>The Bayesian classifier (Duda &amp; Hart, 1973) is a probabilistic
method for classification. It can be used to determine the probability that an
example <i>j</i>  belongs to class <i>Ci </i> given values of attributes of the
example: <p>
<IMG SRC="AAAI8.GIF"><p>
If the attribute values are independent, this probability is proportional to:<p>
<IMG SRC="AAAI9.GIF"><p>
Both 
<IMG SRC="AAAI10.GIF">
and 
<IMG SRC="AAAI11.GIF">
 may be estimated from training data. To determine the most likely class of an
example, the probability of each class is computed. An example is assigned to
the class with the highest probability.<p>
<p>
<b>3.2 Nearest Neighbor</b><p>
<b></b>The nearest neighbor algorithm operates by storing all examples in the
training set. To classify an unseen instance, it assigns it to the class of the
most similar example. Since all of the features we use are binary features, the
most similar example is the one that has the most feature values in common with
a test example.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>3.3 PEBLS</b><p>
<b></b>PEBLS (Cost &amp; Salzberg, 1993) is a nearest neighbor algorithm that
makes use of a modification of the value difference metric, MVDM, (Stanfill
&amp; Waltz, 1986) for computing the distance between two examples.  This
distance between two examples is the sum of the value differences of all
attributes of the examples.  The value difference between two values 
<IMG SRC="AAAI12.GIF">
and 
<IMG SRC="AAAI13.GIF">
of attribute Aj is given by:<p>
<IMG SRC="AAAI14.GIF"><p>
<p>
<b>3.4 Decision Trees</b><p>
<b></b>Decision tree learners such as ID3 build a decision tree by recursively
partitioning examples into subgroups until those subgroups contain examples of
a single class.  A partition is formed by a test on some attribute (e.g., is
the feature database equal to 0). ID3 selects the test that provides the
highest gain in information content.<p>
<p>
<b>3.5 TF-IDF</b><p>
<b></b>TF-IDF is one of the most successful and well-tested techniques in
Information Retrieval (IR). A document is represented as a vector of weighted
terms. The computation of the weights reflects empirical observations regarding
text. Terms that appear frequently in one document (TF = term-frequency), but
rarely on the outside (IDF = inverse-document-frequency), are more likely to be
relevant to the topic of the document. Therefore, the TF-IDF weight of a term
in one document is the product of its term-frequency (TF) and the inverse of
its document frequency (IDF). In addition, to prevent longer documents from
having a better chance of retrieval, the weighted term vectors are normalized
to unit length.<p>
In Syskill &amp; Webert, we use the average of the TF-IDF vectors of all
examples of one class in order to get a prototype-vector for the class (Lang,
1995). To determine the most likely class of an example we convert it to a
TF-IDF vector and then apply the cosine similarity measure to the example
vector and each class prototype. An example is assigned to the class that has
the smallest angle between the TF-IDF vector of the example and the class
prototype.<p>
<p>
<b>3.6 Neural Nets</b><p>
<b></b>We used two approaches to learning with neural nets.  In the perceptron
approach, there are no hidden units and the single output unit is trained with
the delta rule (Widrow &amp; Hoff, 1960). The perceptron is limited to learning
linearly separable functions (Minsky &amp; Papert, 1969). We also use
multi-layer networks trained with error backpropagation (Rummelhart, Hinton
&amp; Williams, 1986). We used 12 hidden units in our experiments.<p>
<p>
<b>4 Experimental Evaluation</b><p>
<b></b>To determine whether it is possible to learn user preferences
accurately, we have had four users use the Syskill &amp; Webert interface to
rate pages. A total of six different user profiles were collected (since one
user rated pages on three different topics).  The topics are summarized in
Table 2 together with the total number of pages that have been rated by the
user.  Two users rated the pages on independent recording artists. One (A)
listened to an excerpt of  songs, and indicated whether the song was liked.  Of
course, the machine learning algorithms only analyze at the HTML source
describing the bands and do not analyze associated sounds or pictures.  Another
user (B) read about the bands (due to the lack of sound output on the computer)
and indicated whether he'd be interested in the band.<p>

<p>
Syskill &amp; Webert is intended to be used to find unseen pages the user would
like.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning algorithms, it is
necessary to run experiments to see if Syskill &amp; Webert's prediction agrees
with the users preferences. Therefore we use a subset of the rated pages for
training the algorithm and evaluate the effectiveness on the remaining rated
pages.   For an individual trial of an experiment,  we randomly selected
<i>k</i>  pages to use as a training set, and reserved the remainder of the
data as a test set.  From the training set, we found the 128 most informative
features, and then recoded the training set as feature vectors to be used by
the learning algorithm. We tried six learning algorithms on each training set.
The learning algorithm created a representation for the user preferences. Next,
the test data was converted to feature vectors using the features found
informative on the training set. Finally, the learned user preferences were
used to determine whether pages in the test set would interest the user.  We
also tested TF-IDF using a similar scheme, except that TF-IDF operated directly
on all of the words in HTML pages and did not require converting the pages to a
set of 128 informative features<a href="AAAI_fn.html#fn0">[5]</a>. For each
trial, we recorded the accuracy of the learned preferences (i.e., the percent
of test examples for which the learned preferences agreed with the user's
interest).  We ran 24  paired trials of each algorithm. Figures 5 and 6 show
the average accuracy of each algorithm as a function of the number of training
examples.  <p>

<p>
The results are promising in that on most of the problems the predictions are
substantially better than simply guessing that the user would not be interested
in a page (which is the most frequent prediction on all topics).  However, no
one algorithm is clearly superior on this set.  To get a more detailed idea of
which algorithms perform well, we analyzed the data to find the algorithm(s)
that were most accurate with 20 training examples in each domain and the
algorithm(s) that were least accurate. In each case, we used a paired, two
tailed t-test to find other algorithms that were not significantly different
from the best and the worst.  On the biomedical domain, the naive Bayesian
classifier was most accurate and ID3 was least. On the LYCOS search domain,
TF-IDF was most accurate and ID3 was least.  On the bands (listening) problem,
nearest neighbor, PEBLS and  backpropagation were most accurate and TF-IDF was
least.  On the bands (reading) problem nearest neighbor, PEBLS ,
backpropagation and  were most accurate and TF-IDF was least.  On the movies
domain  the naive Bayesian classifier was most accurate and nearest neighbor,
ID3 and PEBLS were least. On the protein problem, PEBLS, nearest neighbor, ID3
and the naive Bayesian classifier were most accurate and backprop and the
perceptron were least accurate.  In summary, it appears that ID3 is not
particularly suited to this problem, as one might imagine since it learns
simple necessary and sufficient descriptions about category membership. The
TF-IDF algorithm does not appear to have an advantage over the machine learning
algorithms. In one domain it is significantly better than others, but in
several others it was significantly worse.  Although one must be careful not to
read too much into averaging accuracies across domains, the naive Bayesian
classifier has the highest average accuracy with 20 training examples: 77.1
(standard deviation 4.4). In contrast, PEBLS is  75.2 (4.7), backprop is 75.0
(3.9),  nearest neighbor is 75.0 (5.5), ID3 is 70.6 (3.6) and TF-IDF is 68.5
(12.0).  These results do illustrate that ID3 is not suited to this task and
that TF-IDF has a large amount of variation in its performance.  We have also
experimented with a more advanced decision tree learner C4.5 with similar
results.<p>
We have decided to use the naive Bayesian classifier as the default algorithm
in Syskill &amp; Webert for a variety of reasons.  It is very fast for both
learning and predicting.  Its learning time is linear in the number of examples
and its prediction time is independent of the number of examples.  It is
trivial to create an incremental version of the naive Bayesian classifier. It
provides relatively fine-grained probability estimates that may be used to
order the exploration of new pages in addition to rating them.  For example, on
the biomedical domain, we used a leave-one-out testing methodology to predict
the probability that a user would be interested in a page.  The ten pages with
the highest probability were all correctly classified as interesting and the 10
pages with the lowest probability were all correctly classified as
uninteresting.  There were 21 pages whose probability of being interesting was
above  0.9 and 19 of these were rated as interesting by the user.  There were
64 pages whose probability of being interesting was below 0.1 and only 1 was
rated as interesting by the user.<p>
In the remainder of this paper, we'll concentrate our experimentation on the
naive Bayesian classifier with 20 training examples.  We choose a small number
of examples since most users will want to get results after ranking such a
small number of pages.  We investigate two issues:<p>
* 	Is it possible to get similar accuracy with less work by looking at an
initial portion of the page during learning and prediction?<p>
* 	Can better results be achieved by selecting more (or less) that 128
informative words to use as features?<p>
<p>
<b>4. 1 Processing an initial portion of the page.</b><p>
<b></b>As described so far, it is necessary to store the complete HTML source
of every page rated by the user and to evaluate an unseen page it is necessary
to retrieve the entire HTML to convert the page to a feature vector. Here, we
investigate an alternate approach.  Instead of analyzing the entire HTML to
find informative words, only the words contained in the initial <i>c</i>
characters are used during learning when creating a profile and only those
words in the initial <i>c</i> characters are used  to predict whether a user
would like the page.  Of course, we still select the 128 most informative words
in the initial portions of the pages.  Note that we look at an initial sequence
of characters, rather than words, since the protocol for transmission of
segments of the file is based on characters.<p>
We ran an experiment with the naive Bayesian classifier on the six domains with
20 training examples where we varied the value of <i>c</i>.  The values used
were 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096 and infinity (i.e., using the entire
document). The results of this experiment, averaged over 24 trials, are shown
in Figure 7.  We plot each domain separately and also plot an average over the
six domains. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>
<IMG SRC="AAAI21.GIF"><b></b><p>
<b>Figure 7. </b> The effect of only analyzing the initial  <i>c</i> characters
of a file.<p>
<p>
While in some domains (protein, bands and LYCOS), there is an advantage in not
analyzing the entire document, on average there is a small decrease in
accuracy.  For example, only looking at the first 2048 characters yields an
average accuracy of 74.2 while looking at all characters yields an accuracy of
76.3<a href="AAAI_fn.html#fn0">[6]</a>.  We have run experiments with all of
the other learning algorithms and the general pattern is the same. On average,
it is best to analyze the entire file, but the first 1024 -2048 characters is
sufficient to achieve nearly the same accuracy.  Usually, less than 512
characters results in a significant decrease in accuracy.<p>
Although there is a small decrease in accuracy when looking at the initial
segment of the file, in the next version of Syskill &amp; Webert we will store
and process only an initial segment to reduce the transmission overhead
associated with fetching pages to rank.  We also note that many users of
Syskill &amp; Webert rate a page as interesting without looking at the entire
page and that many information retrieval systems index abstracts rather than
the full text of a document.  <p>
Anecdotally, we have observed that some errors in Syskill &amp; Webert are
caused by analyzing too much of a page.  For example, Syskill &amp; Webert
sometimes rates a page as interesting to a user when it is not. Sometimes this
occurs because the page itself is uninteresting, while at the bottom of the
page, there are pointers and short descriptions of related interesting sites<a
href="AAAI_fn.html#fn0">[7]</a>.  This may explain why in some domains the
accuracy of Syskill and Webert is improved when only analyzing an initial
segment.  <p>
<p>
   <b>4. 2 Varying the number of informative features</b><p>
<b></b>The decision to use the 128 most informative words as features was made
by looking at one initial domain (biomedical) when only 50 examples were
collected.  In this section, we explore the impact of selecting other numbers
of features.  Once again, we show results only for the naive Bayesian
classifier with 20 examples. We experimented with selecting  16, 32, 64, 96,
128, 200, 256, and 400. of the most informative words to use as features. The
results, averaged over 24 trials, are shown in Figure 8. We plot each domain
separately and also plot an average over the six domains.<p>
<IMG SRC="AAAI22.GIF"><b></b><p>
<b>Figure 8. </b>  The effect of varying the number of informative features.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Figure 8 shows that having too few features can cause problems because
important discriminating features are ignored.  On the other hand, having too
many features can also cause problems if many words that aren't very relevant
are used as features.  On average for the values we tested, 96 performed best.
One might consider using information-gain to select a large group of
informative features, and then using existing approaches for feature subset
selection (e.g.,  Kittler, 1986; John, Kohavi, Pfleger, 1994) to select some of
these features using a criteria other than informativeness.  However, such
algorithms increase the complexity of the Bayesian classifier, making it
impractical to learn a profile interactively. <p>
<p>
<b>5. Related work</b><p>
<b></b>The methods developed for our learning agent are related to work in
information retrieval and relevance feedback (e.g., Salton &amp; Buckey, 1990;
Croft &amp; Harper, 1979).  However, rather than learning to adapt user
queries, we are developing a user profile that may be used for classification
tasks such as filtering new information as it becomes available.<p>
There are several other agents designed to perform tasks similar to ours. The
WebWatcher (Armstrong, Freitag, Joachims,  and Mitchell, 1995) system is
designed to help a user retrieve information from Web sites.  When given a
description of a goal (such as retrieving a paper by a particular author), it
suggests which links to follow to get from a starting location to a goal
location.  It learns by watching a user traverse the WWW and it helps the user
when similar goals occur in the future.  The WebWatcher and the work described
here serve different goals. In particular, the user preference profile may be
used to suggest new information sources related to ones the user is interested
in.<p>
Like our work, WebHound (Lashkari, 1995) is designed to suggest new Web pages
that may interest a user.  WebHound uses a collaborative approach to filtering.
In this approach, a user submits a list of pages together with ratings of these
pages. The agent finds other users with similar ratings and suggests unread
pages that are liked by others with similar interests. One drawback of the
collaborative filtering approach is that when new information becomes
available,  others must first read and rate this information before it may be
recommended. In contrast, by learning a user profile, our approach can
determine whether a user is likely to be interested in new information without
relying on the opinions of other users.  Furthermore, the profile learned also
contains information that can be used to create queries of Web search engines
such as LYCOS.   However, one advantage of the collaborative approaches is that
they do not require transmission and analysis of the HTML source of Web
pages.<p>
Balabanovic, Shoham, and Yun (1995) have developed an agent that searches links
from existing pages for pages that might interest a user, using the TF-IDF
weights as part of a user profile.  In our experiments,  TF-IDF did not perform
as well at classification as algorithms designed for classification.  Croft
(1995, personal communications) has argued that the task of classifying pages
differs from the tasks  for which TF-IDF and relevance feedback were designed
and that algorithms designed for classification may provide a more appropriate
bias for the task.  <p>
<b>5 Future Work</b><p>
We are planning two types of enhancements to Syskill &amp; Webert.  First, we
will investigate improvements to the underlying classification technology:  <p>
*	Selecting an appropriate numbers of  features.  The performance of the
learning algorithms is sensitive to the number of relevant features. We
currently use a fixed number of features in a user profile. Rather than fixing
the number, we plan on investigating having a threshold on the minimum
informativeness of a feature.  This may allow Syskill &amp; Webert to adapt the
number of features to the given problem and the number of examples without
increasing the complexity of converting HTML to Boolean features.<p>
*	Explore the use of ordinal rather than Boolean features. Boolean features
indicate whether a word is present or absent in a document. The ordinal
features could indicate the number of times a word is present.  Note that words
include items such as "jpg" and "html" so these may be used to make decisions
based on the number of pictures or links if they are informative.  Like
extensions to TF-IDF, these may be normalized to the length of the document. <p>
*	Using linguistic and hierarchical knowledge in the forming of features.
Linguistic routines such as stemming (i.e., finding the root forms of words)
may improve the accuracy of  Syskill &amp; Webert by having a smaller number of
more informative features.  Currently, words in the pages are used as features
without any knowledge of the relationship between words such as "protein"  and
"proteins."  Semantic knowledge such as the relationship between "pigs" and
"swine" may also prove useful (e.g., Greffenstette, 1992).  Similarly, knowing
that "gif," "jpg" and "jpeg" are all extensions of graphic files would
facilitate Syskill &amp; Webert learning that a user has a preference for (or
against) pages with in-line graphics.<p>
*	We will continue experimentation with various learning algorithms.  Nearest
neighbor algorithms perform about as well as Bayesian classifiers and have many
of the same desirable properties. Nearest neighbor algorithms have a few
potential advantages such as not making independence assumptions and having the
ability to learn nonlinearly separable functions.  One possibility that we are
now implementing is using the TF-IDF weights as part of similarity metric for
nearest neighbor.  Syskill &amp; Webert is implemented in a fashion that allows
us to easily change the representation of user profiles.<p>
<p>
Another set of enhancements to Syskill &amp; Webert involve the redesign of the
user interface to make it more interactive.   We are currently reimplementing
many of its capabilities as JAVA applets.  One important advantage of this
reimplementation is that the user profile can then be stored on the client
rather than on the Syskill &amp; Webert server.  We are also exploring several
other enhancements to the interface that will make it easier to use (and as a
consequence allow us to collect more data for our experiments). <p>
*	Implementing routines that interactively annotate the index page with Syskill
&amp; Webert's predictions as the initial 2k of each link is processed.
Currently, no annotations are added until all links have been retrieved and
rated.  We allow the user to prefetch links so that the rating can occur
rapidly, but this does require patience the first time Syskill &amp; Webert is
used and disk space to store local copies of files. <p>
*	Currently, Syskill &amp; Webert displays its raking as annotations on the
current page that is displayed.  We are planning on an option that will create
a new page with Syskill &amp; Webert's rankings sorted by the probability
estimate that the page is hot. <p>
*	Currently, Syskill &amp; Webert retrieves the original source of a page to
determine its interestingness.  Several of the Web search engines such as LYCOS
store a summary of the page (e.g., See Figure 4).  We are implementing routines
to use this summary for rating the interestingness of a page.  Combined with
the previous option, this will reorder the suggestion made by LYCOS based on
the user's profile. This may be particularly useful with "CyberSearch" which is
a copy of much of the LYCOS database on CD-ROM eliminating the network
connection overhead as well as the network transmission overhead.<p>
* 	We plan on monitoring the topic page of each topic of a user, and notifying
the user when a new link is added to the page that is rated as interesting.<p>
<p>
<b>7 Conclusions</b> <p>
We have introduced an agent that collects user evaluations of the
interestingness of pages on the World Wide Web.  We have shown that a user
profile may be learned from this information and that this user profile can be
used to determine what other pages might interest the user.   Such pages can be
found immediately accessible from a user-defined index page for a given topic
or by using a Web search engine.   Experiments on six topics with four users
showed that the Bayesian classifier performs well at this classification task,
both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.  Other learning algorithms that make
classifications based on combining evidence from a large number of features
also performed well. ID3 was not very accurate perhaps since it tries to
minimize the number of features it tests to make a classification and accurate
classifications cannot be based on the presence or absence of a few words.
Further experimentation showed that nearly the same classification accuracy
could be achieved by looking only at the initial portion of a page, suggesting
an enhancement to the interface that reduces storage space and network
transmission overhead.<p>
