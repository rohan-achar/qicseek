"<B>The ProcessWall: A Process State Server Approach to Process
Programming</B>"</A>, by Dennis Heimbigner, in 
<i>Proceedings of ACM SIGSOFT Fifth Symposium on Software
Development Environments,</i>
pages 159-168, Tyson's Corner, VA, December 1992.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

The ProcessWall is a process state server providing storage for
process states plus operations for defining and manipulating the
structure of those states.  It separates the state of a software
process from any program for constructing that state.  Instead, client
programs implement the processes for operating on the process state.
This approach has a number of potential benefits such as support for
process formalism interoperability, support for multiple process
languages, low-cost retro-fitting of process into existing
environments, and support for long-term execution of processes.  The
process server interface provides descriptive mechanisms for
representing process state as well as product state.  A classification
of client programs is provided to show how the state server can be
used in a variety of ways.
