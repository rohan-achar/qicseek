This software evaluates double-dummy bridge hands.
I have made some attempts to make the system
not overly user-hostile.
<P>
This software is tricky to write correctly,
and it is hard to verify
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/correctness.html">
correctness</a>.

   <LI> EVAL:
        evaluates a bridge hand and, optionally, produces a playing tree
<BR>
        This program determines whether one side
        can take the specified number of tricks against
        perfect defense and, if so, exactly how it can be done.
        Newer versions have dramatically improved
        <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/performance.html">
        performance</a>.

   <LI> PLAY:
        uses the playing tree to play optimally
<BR>
        You get to play defense against the program's perfect offense.
        In this manner, you will observe how any possible defense
        can be overcome.
<P>
   <LI> The Version 1 system uses
        <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/alpha.html">
        alpha-beta search</A>, including some
        <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/amenities.html">
        amenities</A>:
        dynamic rank equivalence, suit ordering,
        and dynamic rank ordering.
        A brief discussion of some
        <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/implement.html">
        implementation</a> details is available.
<P>
   <LI> The Version 2 system uses
        <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/isomorphism.html">
        node isomorphism</a> and is an order
        of magnitude faster than Version 1.
        It also allows the user to configure memory usage.
        This version was a bit trickier to code since now there is a DAG
        (directed acyclic graph) rather than merely a tree.
<P>
   <LI> The Version 3 system uses
        <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/isomorphism.html">
        node equivalence</a>.
        For difficult problems it is an order of magnitude faster than
        Version 2.  Version 3 files are fundamentally different from
        and incompatible with earlier versions.

<P>
   <LI> The Version 4 system uses dynamic backtracking, some dynamic
        heuristics that are enhanced by learning techniques utilizing
        <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/pubs/searchsurv.ps.gz">
        self-organizing lists</a>, and some code tuning.
        Version 4 appears to be about twice as fast as Version 3.
        (For some hard hands, it is an order of magnitude faster
        than Version 3 for tree construction.)
        Optionally, the program determines the maximum number
        of tricks that are guaranteed makable, as opposed to just
        deciding the question for a specified number of tricks.
<!--
<P>
   <LI> The Version 5 system, under development,
        will use a modified partition search and is hoped to be
        an order of magnitude faster than Version 4.

<P>
   <LI>  Can you solve this
         <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/devilish.txt">
         devilish hand</a>, which was described in rec.games.bridge?
         If not, EVAL can solve it for you.
   <LI>  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/bridge/hand7h.txt">
         Here</a> is another hand.
   <LI>  This <a href="slam.txt">slam hand</a> was presented
         as the Bridge Plaza Deal of the Week in April 1997.

NOTE ADDED March 2008:
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The old EVAL software will not run on newer architectures.
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Some year, when I have a chance, I will recompile it.
