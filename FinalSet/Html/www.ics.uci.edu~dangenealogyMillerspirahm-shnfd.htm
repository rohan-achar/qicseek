Hi,
I am doing family research on the name Schonfeld. My maternal
grandfather, Moses (Moishe) Schonfeld, was the 8th of 10 children from
the second wife, Bayla, of Zvi Elimelech Schonfeld. Zvi had two children
from his first wife, she died and he left them with his in-laws in
Hungary. Bayla was the sister of the first wife.Since my grandfather was
the 10th of his 12 children and was born in1867, the older ones would
have been born in the 1840's and Zvi maybe in the 1820's.Any
connections?

Hi,
 I found your page fascinating especially since my mother has
  her grandfather's name as Zvi Elimelech and one of her sister's 
  said his name was Hersh Shula and my grandparents had a first 
  baby boy who died shortly after birth whose name was Hersh 
  Melech. I don't know hi wives maiden names nor his first 
  wife's name, just my great grandmother Bayla. Some of your 
  dates dont fit if I am estimating my grandfather's birth in 
  1867. since he was the 10th if Zvi's children his father had 
  to have been born at least 35 when he was born so Zvi would 
  have had to be born no later than 1830. Wish I could help 
  more. I don't know any of my grandfathers siblings names but 
  have several of his niece's and nephew's names and will try 
  that route.


Marge Schechner


I would say most definitely. To tell you where you fit, can you provide 
either some of the siblings names or verify that Bayla's maiden name was 
Kallush? Did he have a sister Sara? Please see my website at
www.langsam.com
or the specific page at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm#L3.4.11
Please let me know,

Hi,
Thanks for the clarification. Found out that his name was Hersh 
Melech and Hebrew name was Zvi Elimelech which now makes sense 
since the baby who would have been my mother's oldest sibling 
was named Hersh Melech (he died after &quot;a bad bris&quot;)for their 
grandfather.

Hi,
Sorry for the delay. I will answer the rest of your email shortly. Just one 
thing to point out.
Hersh Shula is not a name. It must have been Hersh. The phonetic &quot;ula&quot; 
&quot;ela&quot;, or &quot;ala&quot; is added at the end of almost any name as a term of 
endearment, like Moshela (for Moshe), Chanala (for Chana), etc.

Hi,
 I wish I could help with this one but the only one that I know of is my 
 grandfather, Moses (Moshe). For some reason,no one in the family knows 
 the names of any of his siblings, just that Zvi was from Hungary and 
 born somewhere in the 1820-30 range.Zvi had died by 1896 since the first 
 child to my grandparents was a boy named Hersh Melech who died shortly 
 after birth and was born in 1896. I know the names of a few of his 
 siblings children who were my grandfather's age. One of his siblings 
 sons(obviously a brother) was Abe Schonfeld who accompanied my grandmother 
 here in 1912, June or so to New York  and two sisters, Esther Weisman and  
 Fannie Goldberg, who were about my grandmother's age so born about 1875 to 
 another of his siblings but dont know if they were Schoenfelds by maiden 
 name or not.

Hi,
Can we start in the beginning? Can you list (in age order?) the children 
from each of R' Zvi Elimelech's marriages? For women, can you add their 
married names?
Do you have a genelogical report out of a program like Family Tree Maker or 
such?

The only thing that I can add is that my grandfather was the 8th of 10 
children from the second marriage and he was born in 1867 so if R'Hersh 
Mylech Spira died in 1841, then my great grandfather would have been born 
then and fathered 10 children by the time he was 26 in 1867, when my 
grandfather was born. Possible, but not likely,unless a lot of them died 
in infancy and another was produced in less than a year. I wish I knew.

Hi,
Thanks for your response. You should be aware that Zvi Elimelech's (Hersh 
Mylech) namesake was the famed R' Hersh Mylech Spira, author of various 
books, the most famous entitled &quot;Bnei Yissochur&quot;, for which he is known. He 
lived from 1783 - 1841. Can your datres fit with your g-grandfather being 
born then (>1841) instead of 1820-1830?

Hi,
The first baby was a boy named Harry (Hersh Melech) who died shortly 
after birth in 1896 or 7 from a &quot;bad bris&quot;.First one to survive was my 
aunt Bertha, born November 20,1898.

Thanks for the reply. One more question. What year was his first child born?

Hi,
 I found another evidence of my grandfather's birth year on his Naturlization 
 certificate. It is dated 10/7/21 and has his age as 54, so again birth year 
 1867. Been thinking about the famiy story of his being the 8th of 10 children. 
 We have no proof since he never mentioned names of any of his siblings. There 
 were at least two since it was his nephew Abe Schoenfeld who accompanied my 
 grandmother here in 1912 and it was his niece Esther Weisman who he stayed 
 with in NY while my grandmother was in Europe.

The message below bounced. Hoping that one of our subscribers has the
current e-mail address for Nathan Rosenshein ....and will forward this
message to him.



Dear Nathan,


I finally have definitive knowledge as to how the Schonfeld and Kallush
families are related:


Rabbi Meshullam Dov Kallush, Dayan (religious court judge) of Munkacs was
the father-in-law of Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Schonfeld (son of Moshe Schonfeld
and Sara Spira, the daughter of the Bnei Yissaschar). In fact, after Rabbi
Z.E. Schonfeld's zivug rishon (first wife) was niftar (died)her sibling
became his sivug sheni (second wife). I have known this for several years.
What is new is that Rabbi Meshullam Dov Kallush also had a son Elimelech
Kallush who had a son Shalom Kallush (d.1920) who married a daughter of
Rabbi Z.E. Schonfeld. Shalom and his wife, nee' Schonfeld had a son BenZion
and a daughter Chaya Breine who married Rabbi Shlomo Eliezer Weisel (he was
Rabbi in a town in Maramoresh). Other Kallush offspring are not named here
since I don't have that information. Hopefully, this will be helpful to you,
and others as well.


Best wishes,


Louis Schonfeld
