<H2>some implementation details</H2>

Two cards, X and Y, of the same suit in one hand are
<I>rank-equivalent</I>
if none of the other 3 players have any cards in that
suit with rank in between those of X and Y.
Dynamic rank equivalence can be implemented by maintaining an
array of length 52, one cell for each of the cards in the deck,
with each cell containing a value from the set {N,E,W,S,none}
indicating which (if any) of the players holds that card in his hand.
For purposes of determining equivalence, it is important
that this array is not updated at the time a player plays a card!
The array must be updated only at the conclusion of a trick.
<P>
<I>Node isomorphism</I> refers to the situation in which
two nodes correspond to identical hand configurations
with equal number of tricks taken by N/S.
Node isomorphism can be implemented by maintaining a list
of configurations and their associated values,
indicating which partnership, N/S or E/W, will prevail
starting from that configuration.
When encountering a configuration, C, the list is checked
to determine whether C is listed.
If it is, then the value of configuration C
can be obtained from the stored value, thereby avoiding the
necessity of expanding the entire tree of possibilities.
If it is not, then the pair [C,unknown] is entered onto the list
and, after C has been evaluated (say, to find that N/S will prevail)
then this entry is updated (to become [C,N/S]).
<P>
For difficult problems, the number of encountered configurations
can be so large that there will not be enough space to store
all of them.  In that situation, it is effective to store
the configurations that will have the most impact in avoiding
tree expansion.   Also, for speed considerations, it is important
that the list be searchable very rapidly.  These various concerns
can be addressed efficiently and effectively by using a variant
of <I>Robin Hood hashing</I>.  For very difficult problems,
additional speed enhancements might be possible by use of a
<I>Bloom filter</I>.
<P>
To obtain the greatest benefit,
it is best that the hash table have the largest size possible.
The size of the table is not the number of bytes stored
in the table -- it is the maximum number of entries that can
be stored in the table.  It is true that increasing the number of bytes
available for the table will increase the number of entries.
But equally effective, and even more important for speed considerations,
is the fact that decreasing the number of bytes required for one
entry will increase the maximum number of entries that can be held
by a table having capacity of a fixed number of bytes.
<P>
I encode a configuration in 8 bytes.
When it is possible that an output tree will be produced,
each configuration requires an additional 4 bytes.
Also, producing an output tree necessitates the use of
a rather large stack, typically allowed 1-2 Megs.
<P>
The stack contains the body of what will ultimately be the tree file.
The tree file format is roughly as follows.
There is a primary header,
which describes the initial state of the program
(number of cards per player, who are the "goodguys",etc.)
a secondary header,
which describes the contents of the 4 hands,
and the body, which contains one word that gives the number of
words in the rest of the body and then a series of cells
that are stored in depth-first search order.
A cell describes a trick.  It contains:
<UL> For Versions 1,2:  
 <LI> in one word: the round number, the leader, the winner, the 4 cards
 <LI> if a duplicate position has been reached then the next 2 words
      contain:  ZERO,  pointer to identical position cell
</UL>
<UL> For Versions 3,4:
 <LI> in one word: the round number, the leader, the 4 card equivalents,
      and indication as to whether a duplicate position has been reached
 <LI> if a duplicate position has been reached then
      the next word contains:   pointer to identical position cell
