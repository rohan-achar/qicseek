<h1> > Self-Improving Algorithms for Delaunay Triangulations  </h1>
<h2> 
Ken Clarkson, IBM Almaden Research Center </h2>


<p>
This work investigates ways in which an algorithm can improve its
expected performance by fine-tuning itself automatically, with respect
to an arbitrary and unknown input distribution. We give such
self-improving algorithms for sorting and for computing Delaunay
triangulations. Each algorithm begins with a training phase during which
it adjusts itself to the input distribution, followed by a stationary
regime in which the algorithm settles to its optimized incarnation. We
show that in both cases, in the stationary regime, the algorithms run as
fast as possible.
