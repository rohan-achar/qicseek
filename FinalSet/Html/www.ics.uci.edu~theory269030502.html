Exact algorithms for Exact Satisfiability
<br>
Jesper Makholm Byskov
</h2>

<p>
The Exact Satisfiability problem (XSAT) is the variant of the
Satisfiability problem (SAT) in which we are given a formula in
conjunctive normal form and are asked to find a truth assignment to
the variables s.t. EXACTLY one literal in each clause is true. The
Exact 3-Satisfiability problem (X3SAT) is the restriction of XSAT to
formulas with at most three literals per clause.
</p>
<p>
We are interested in algorithms for these two problems with good
worst-case complexity, i.e. better than the trivial O(2^n) which comes
from trying all possible truth assignments. For XSAT we improve the
running time from O(2^(0.2441*n)) to O(2^(0.2325*n)) and for X3SAT we
improve the running time from O(2^(0.1626*n)) to O(2^(1379*n)).
</p>
<p>
Our algorithms work by analysing the formula and branching depending
on a number of different cases. As the number of cases is rather
large, I will give an overview of the ideas and only cover some of the
cases in detail.

This is joint work with Bolette Ammitzb�ll Madsen and Bjarke
Skjernaa. It has not been published yet, but if you are interested,
lease send me an email at jespermn@ics.uci.edu.
