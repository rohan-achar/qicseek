Data mining practitioners frequently have to spend 
significant portion of their project time on data preprocessing
before they can apply their algorithms on real-world datasets.
Such a preprocessing is required because many real-world 
datasets are not perfect, but rather they contain missing,
erroneous, duplicate data and other data cleaning problems.
It is a well established fact that, in general, if 
such problems with data are not corrected, applying
data mining algorithm can lead to wrong results.
The latter is known as the "garbage in, garbage out" principle.
Given the significance of the problem, numerous data cleaning
techniques have been designed in the past to address the aforementioned
problems with data.<BR>
<BR>
In this paper we address one of the data cleaning challenges, called
<EM>object consolidation</EM>. This important challenge arises because
objects in datasets are frequently represented via descriptions
(a set of instantiated attributes), which alone might not always
uniquely identify the object. The goal of <EM>object consolidation</EM>
is to correctly consolidate (i.e., to group/determine) all the 
representations of the same object, for each object in the dataset. 
In contrast to traditional domain-independent data cleaning techniques, 
our approach analyzes not only object features, but also additional semantic
information: <EM>inter-objects relationships</EM>, 
for the purpose of object consolidation. The approach views datasets
as attributed relational graphs (ARGs) of object representations (nodes), 
connected via relationships (edges). The approach
then applies graph partitioning techniques to accurately cluster object 
representations.
Our empirical study over real datasets shows that
analyzing relationships significantly improves the quality of the result.
