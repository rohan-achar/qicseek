<p> The workshop announcement states in regard to the WWW that "the
software engineering community is now faced with two significant
challenges and opportunities on:

<ul>
<li> how best to capitalize on the nature of the Web to leverage
existing goals and work and,

<li> how, given our expertise in building software systems, to
participate in the shaping of the Web."
</ul>

<p> But the WWW is more than a new technology for software engineers to
leverage and shape for our problems.  The WWW is an <em>enabling
technology</em>.  The Web has the potential of changing software
development as dramatically as the transistor and microprocessor
changed computer architecture.

<p> An enabling technology does this by changing fundamental assumptions
which are ingrained in our discipline.  For example, the
microprocessor changed the reliability, cost, transistor density, and
performance assumptions underlying hardware design.  Changing these
underlying assumptions resulted in new design approaches and broadened
the practical scope of its use.

<p> The central premise of this paper is that the Web changes some of the
fundamental assumptions underlying existing software engineering
discipline.  Consequently, the Web has the potential for changing our
notion of the software artifact itself and the processes by which it
is constructed.


<h2> What Assumptions Are Changing? </h2>

<p>Predicting the impact of the Web on software engineering is
difficult.  Instead, we focus on the changing assumptions implied by
the Web.  We believe it is more effective to state the catalysts of
change than to predict their effects. Since the Web itself is rapidly
changing, our list is bound to grow in length.

<ul>

<li> cheap, direct, highly accessibly customer channel -- The Web
provides a cheap, direct, and easily accessible medium of
communication between customers and software developers.  Customers
can use the Web to interact directly with software developers, for
example to request product features and submit bug reports.

<p> Software producers have begun using the Web to advertise their
products, and provide product literature, product support, and early
prototypes to customers. Distribution costs are significantly lowered
in comparison to tradition distribution channels which require product
packaging, space on store shelves, and warehousing costs.

<p> The Web enables new software pricing models, such as per use or
per function.  The Web also makes the distribution of small
applications economical.  Such applications, freely distributed by
software producers, may provide an effective means to advertise
software and services. <br> <br>

<li> remote, frequently updated resources -- Product documentation,
tutorials, help, frequently asked questions may also be provided to
customers in a timely, cost effective manner.  Software patches,
providing bug fixes and new functionality, distributed using the Web
have also become common place.  The Web enables new software
distribution models, such as weekly updates, by significantly reducing
the costs and risks traditionally associated with software
distribution.  <br> <br>

<li> new medium of communication and distribution -- The software
artifact has evolved as the communication and distribution medium
available to it has evolved.  Since the Web provides a new medium of
information exchange, the software artifact itself will evolve in
order to use it effectively. This change has far reaching consequences
and is dealt with in a subsequent section of this paper.
 <br> <br>

<li> large, globally accessibly information spaces -- The Web provides a
globally shared and hyper-linked information space, in which the
physical location of the information is largely transparent to users.
By significantly reducing the difficulty and costs associated with
browsing and extending and globally shared information space, the Web
has enabled geographically distributed development of complex products
<a href="#CTG96">[CTG96]</a>. <br> <br>

<li> searching of large global information spaces -- Effectively
utilizing a large, global information spaces hinges on the ability to
effectively and efficiently search it.  The existence of several
keyword-based Web indexing technologies, such as <a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com">AltaVista</a>, demonstrate
that searching unstructured information is feasible and effective.
Categorization-based indexing, such as <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">
Yahoo!</a>, is an effective means for searching smaller information
spaces.

<p>Both keyword- and categorization-based techniques have been used as
mechanisms to support Web-based component repositories.  <a
href="http://www.gamelan.com">Gamelan</a>, a popular Java component
and resource repository, has indexed approximately 6,000
artifacts. <br> <br>

<li> simplicity, extensibility, standardization -- The Web is based on
several simple, extensible standards (e.g., URI, HTTP, and HTML).
Simultaneously achieving all three properties resulted in significant
benefits: simplicity facilitated adoption, extensibility facilitated
evolution and customization, and standardization facilitated
interoperability and heterogeneity.  Software engineers strive to build
systems with similar benefits, but are arguably rarely as successful.
The effectiveness of these properties in helping to achieve these
benefits should not be underestimated.

</ul>

<p>The subsequent sections of this paper explore one of these changing
assumptions, the Web as a new medium of information exchange, in the
hopes that a more detailed discussion will more clearly demonstrate
the dramatic changes that the Web represents.


<h2> The Web as a New Medium for Software </h2>

<p>The software artifact has evolved as the communication and
distribution medium available to it has evolved.  Because the Web
represents a new medium of information exchange accessible to the
software artifact, it has the potential to change the software
artifact.

<p>Traditional software distribution mediums include magnetic tape,
floppy disk, CD-ROMs, and networked PCs.  Consider the CD-ROM's
effects on the software artifact and its distribution.  The tremendous
capacity provided a cost effective mechanism to distribute large
software systems and data.  Multimedia reference and entertainment
software represented a new class of systems that took advantage of the
unique properties of the medium.

<p>Even though we are at its early stages, some of the Web's effects
on software is already apparent.  Miniature applications, called
applets, have become commonplace on the Web.  Several interesting
properties set them apart from traditional software applications:

<ul>

<li> applets are automatically downloaded, installed, and executed without
user involvement;

<li> applets "reside" on Web pages, automatically being executed when
the user arrives at the page and stopped when the user leaves the
page;

<li> applets are embedded within the information of a Web page, as
opposed to traditional applications which embed the information;

<li> applets are dynamically and transparently loaded on an as-needed basis;

<li> applets are cached by the browser for efficiently;

<li> applet interaction with the browser and client operating system are
severely restricted for security reasons.

</ul>

<p> In effect, software has inherited several properties of the Web
medium.  In the cases distinguished above, it in essence behaves as
another browser content type.  In order to display a Web page, the
browser downloads all the elements of the Web page, and for each one
determines the content type of the element and invokes the associated
content handler.  In the case of applets, the browser's content
handler is an interpreter for a virtual machine which essentially
executes the content.

<p> Initially, the Web could be characterized as a medium based solely
on a "pull" content model, in which users <em>explicitly</em> request
pages to be downloaded from the server to the browser.  Recent
technologies (e.g., <a
href="http://www.marimba.com/datasheets/castanet-ds.html">Marimba's
Castanet</a>) built atop the Web infrastructure have begun to
extended the medium to support a "push" content model as well.  In a
push content model, users can register interest in a Web page and the
server sends the Web page to the browser whenever it changes.  Other
communication mediums that are based on the push model include
television and radio broadcasting.

A medium supporting the push model has the potential to further
differentiate software that effectively leverages its properties.  The
distinguishing characteristics of the push model for software includes
the ability to:

<ul>

<li> receive and apply software patches as they are made available;

<li> tailor software distribution to the specific needs of individual
users by permitting finer grained control when registering interests.

</ul>


<h2> Evaluating Existing Technologies  </h2>

<p>The existing set of technologies provide some of the facilities
needed to effectively leverage the properties of the Web, but they
fall short in several respects.  In this section, we discuss the
effectiveness of browser plug-ins, <a href=#Java>Java applets</a>, <a
href=#ActiveX">ActiveX components</a>, and <a
href="#Castanet">Castanet</a> in enabling software systems to leverage
the Web communication and distribution medium.

<h3> Browser Plug-Ins </h3>

<p>Browsers "plug-ins" have enabled independent extension of media
types, thereby enabling third-parties to extend the browser without
changing browser source code.  A plug-in encapsulates the
functionality required to display a particular content type as a
software component (typically implemented as a dynamic link library).
When the browser is executed, it determines which plug-ins are
available and the content types they support.  The browser augments
its internally supported content types with those supported by
plug-ins. When the browser downloads an element from a Web page whose
handler is provided by a plug-in, the handler is loaded and executed
to display content within a window region determined by browser <a
href="#NPA96">[NPA96]</a>.  But plug-ins suffer two shortcomings
that prevent them from taking full advantage of the medium: (1) users
must explicitly request that a new plug-in be downloaded, and (2)
users must manually install them which usually requires quitting and
restarting the browser so that the new plug-in can be recognized.

<h3> ActiveX and Java Applets </h3>

<p>Java applets and ActiveX components are two mechanisms for
implementing applets.  From our perspective, the most significant
differences between the two are (a) ActiveX components are applets
written for specific platforms whereas Java applets are byte-code
interpreted and chiefly platform independent; and (b) the security
model adopt by them. The ActiveX security model resembles that of a
software retail store in which the company that developed the applet
is identified and the user is asked to approve its execution.  Once
approved, the applet has unrestricted access to the client machine.
The Java applet security model is based the "sandbox" model, in which
applets are executed without explicit user approval but has severely
restricted access to the client machine.

<p>Unlike plug-ins, ActiveX and Java applets are downloaded,
installed, and executed automatically and without user involvement.
But both suffer several shortcomings that restrict the degree to which
they can leverage the medium.  Both technologies restrict the applet's
execution scope to a single Web page.  As such, an applet's execution
context cannot be preserved beyond a Web page unless the context is
transmitted to the Web server as the user leaves the source page, and
subsequently downloaded when the user arrives at the destination page.

<p>Security restrictions inherent in the Java "sandbox" model provides
further restricts on Java applets.  Java applets cannot tailor their
behavior to the user's environment since they are restricted from
querying and otherwise accessing the client machine.  Since each Java
applet runs in its own sandbox, direct inter-applet communication is
prohibited.  Applets can only communicate if (a) both were downloaded
from the same Web server, (b) each is explicitly aware of one other,
and (c) all communication is routed through the common Web server.

<h3> Castanet </h3>

<p> <a
href="http://www.marimba.com/datasheets/castanet-ds.html">Marimba's
Castanet</a> technology is representative of early efforts at
extending the Web communications medium to support the push model.
Two components comprise the functionality: a client-side component
that allows the user to register interest in and receive content from
multiple sources, and a server-side component that maintains user
interests, manages distribution, and transmits the content as it
changes.

<p> Castanet distributions are independent of browser Web pages, so
distributed content may persists until the user explicitly unregisters
interest in the content.  This alleviates the execution scope
limitations inherent in the Java applet and ActiveX
approaches. Castanet's server-side component may be extended using a
plug-in mechanism, thereby permitting the content it distributes to be
personalized on a user-by-user basis.

<p> Existing Castanet technology is based on Java applications,
thereby avoiding the severe security restrictions of Java applets.
But Castanet content has limited access to the users client machine,
for example file I/O is restricted to a private directory.

<p> But because a separate Java virtual machine is used to execute
content provided by each source site, communication among content
provided by different sites is restricted.


<h2> Preliminary Work </h2>

<p>We have done preliminary work in building an environment that
supports access to the Web medium which is less restrictive than the
existing technologies in the hopes of investigating the consequences
of the medium freely.  Although our prototype is incomplete,
experiments with it have been encouraging.

<p>Our environment consists of a Web browser, a component repository,
a command shell, and an applet incorporation handler.  Using the
environment, the user can locate a desired applet.  By clicking on the
applet, the user explicitly requests that it be downloaded.  The Web
browser then downloads the applet binary and invokes the incorporation
handler to process the applet.  The incorporation handler uncompresses
the applet and deposits it into the component repository.  Once
applets have been placed in the repository, users can invoke them
using the command shell.

<p>Applets in our environment adhere to a canonical structure which
requires that they communicate exclusively using event broadcasts.  By
controlling the event routing mechanism between applets, the command
shell allows the user to compose applets in arbitrary ways.  In this
sense, our command shell is similar to the ability of a UNIX command
shell in allowing users to combine UNIX filter applications using UNIX
pipes.

<p>All the tools in the environment are written in the Java
programming language.  The JFox Web browser <a
href="#Wen96">[Wen96]</a> was integrated by modifying it to recognize
our applet content type and to handle the content type using our
incorporation handler.

<p>Although simplistic, our environment is unique in that it allows
applets downloaded from different sources to communicate under user
control.  Applets may freely query the client machine and utilize
facilities of the host operating system.

<p>The current implementation has only allowed us to investigate the
pull model aspects of the Web medium.  In the future, we plan on
integrating existing push content technology into the environment to
enable further investigation.


<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>The properties of the Web medium raise many interesting issues and
questions that should be considered and investigated by the software
engineering community.  Some interesting questions include:

<ul>

<li> Is the Web expanding the domain of software engineering or just
causing us to look at an unexplored region of the existing domain?

<li> Do these changing assumptions necessitate fundamentally new
techniques, methods, and processes for software development or can
existing techniques be applied effectively?

<li> What are the tradeoffs between the benefits the Web medium and
the risks inherent in its use?

</ul>
