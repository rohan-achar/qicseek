<h2> April 2, Spring Quarter 2010: Theory Seminar </h2>
<h3>1:00pm in ICS 243</h3>
<h1>   
Creating "Good" Point Clouds
</h1>
<h2> Dick Palais, UCI</h2>

<p>
Abstract: 
In this talk I will discuss algorithms for creating Point Clouds with
desirable properties for use in Mathematical Visualization. And I
mean "discuss" literally--I will explain some ideas that I hope you
will find interesting (and maybe even a little elegant), but I am
also
hoping for feedback from the audience to help me with some unsolved
problems.

<p>
Please arrive a few minutes early, as their are a limited number of
3D glasses that will be passed out so as to appreciate this talk.
