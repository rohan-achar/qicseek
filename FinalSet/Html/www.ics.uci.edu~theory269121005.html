<h1>
Force-Directed Graph Drawing Using Social Gravity and Scaling
</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ltrott/">Lowell Trott</a></h2>
<p>
Force-directed layout algorithms produce graph drawings by resolving
a system of emulated physical forces. We present techniques for using
social gravity as an additional force in force-directed layouts,
together with a scaling technique, to produce drawings of trees and
forests, as well as more complex social networks. Social gravity
assigns mass to vertices in proportion to their net- work centrality,
which allows vertices that are more graph-theoretically central to be
visualized in physically central locations. Scaling varies the
gravitational force throughout the simulation, and reduces crossings
relative to unscaled gravity. In addition to providing this
algorithmic framework, we apply our algorithms to social networks
produced by Mark Lombardi, and we show how social gravity can be
incorporated into force-directed Lombardi-style drawings.
