The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below. </em></p></blockquote><h3>Applicability</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations? </em></p>    <ul>        <li><em>An applicable situation </em></li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Participants</h3><blockquote>    <p>The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities. </p>    <ul>        <li>Participant Name: Responsibility for what </li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Collaborations</h3><blockquote>    <p>How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities. </p>    <ul>        <li>[Collaboration] </li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Consequences</h3><blockquote>    <p>Communication intermediation has the following benefits: </p>    <ol>        <li>They do not alter the service provider or consumer.</li>        <li>Their overhead is amortized in high cost operations.</li>        <li>They facilitate logging and playback. Because all the            interaction between the service provider and consumer            occurs by way of the communication intermediator, the            interactions may be logged and played back at a later            time.</li>    </ol>    <p>Communication intermediation has the following    limitations:</p>    <ol>        <li>They apply only to explicit communication channels.</li>    </ol></blockquote><h3>Implementation</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues? </em></p>    <ol>        <li><em>Description of Bullet </em></li>    </ol></blockquote><h3>Known Uses</h3><blockquote>    <p>Firewalls, Web proxy servers, and CORBA interceptors are    examples of communication intermediation.</p></blockquote><h3>Related Mechanisms</h3><blockquote>    <p>See <a href="reified-connectors.html">reified connectors</a>    and <a href="instrumented-connectors.html">instrumented    connectors</a> for more specific instances of the    communication intermediation mechanism.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peymano/adaptation/"><em>Backto the Adaptation home page</em></a><em>.
