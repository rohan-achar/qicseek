<H3>Introduction:</H3>

This article is intended to help Educators, Parents and Children better
utilize their Web resources.  Included in this paper is information 
pertaining to the
<A HREF="#Teachers"> TEACHER</A> who is interested in better 
exploring the Web and the idea of using it within the classroom as an 
additional teaching tool.  Also included are sites throughout the Web
that
<A HREF="#par">PARENTS</A> can utilize at home to better educate 
themselves on how they can interact with their children and the education 
process. Also given are sites that would be fun to peruse with children.
 A section on what
<A HREF="#kid">KIDS</A> 
can do on the Web has also been included. Everything from sports 
information to actual games that can be played.  The goal is to create a 
resource that can be used by educators, parents and children.

<H4> <A NAME="Teachers"> Teachers </A> </H4>
Teachers, where do you begin?
  Many educators have yet to explore the world of<A 
HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/dic.html">
 Cyberspace</A>. This world of Cyberspace can seem confusing. Many<A 
HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/stories.menu.html">
 questions and 
doubts</A> may arise to a teacher who is
considering using a computer as another teaching tool within the classroom:
<OL> 
<LI>What is the <A HREF="#History">history of the internet</A>?
<LI>What are some internet<A HREF="#resources>resources</A> for educators?
<LI>What are some <A HREF="#Activities">interactive classroom activities</A> 
that involve the computer? </OL>
These questions and more will be explored in the next few pages.


<P>

<H5> <A NAME="History"> <B> History of the Internet </B> </A>  </H5> 

The Internet
or information highway was born in 1969 although
 it had been thought over theoretically for over 25 years.  
It was instigated by the U.S. Department of Defense as a way 
for computers at distant locations to "talk" with each other.  
This communication was to be used to transfer military and
national security data. Well, today it has developed into much
more. It is now a source that can be used by people all over the world to transfer data and exchange information.

<P>
<H6>
<B> <A NAME="Resources">Educational Resources for Educators</A></B>  
</H6> There are some good resources on the Web that a beginner may access.
There is an educational Web server called
<A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/">
Web 66</A> that contains among it's many 
educational goals, the goal of helping educators of grades K-12 learn
how to set up their own Internet servers. The Web 66 Classroom <A
HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/contents.html">

Internet Server
Cookbook</A>may be a helpful tool for the beginner Webber. It contains
information on adding pictures and sound to the page that you create.
It also includes information on how to mail share and creating your own
mailing list. In it's 
<A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/Kitchen.html"> Server Kitchen</A>
you are
able to find all the basic information on beginning an educational
connection to the Web. Also helpful is the <A
HREF="http://www.batnet.com/ape/machttp_talk/machttpservers.by.mac.html">
Home Page of Macintosh</A>, you can learn all about their
various servers.  There are also links to other home pages where you can
find out more about different types of computers.  Please note, however,
that not all of your technical problems and questions can be found answered
on the Web for you.
Many technical questions may need to be addressed to someone that you can
talk
to directly.  

<P>

There are many resources on the Web that are available for teachers.
One such source that was previously mentioned was <A
HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/"> Web 66</A>. Web not only contains
informative computer server information, but it also contains links to
educational documents all over the Web. Web 66 includes a What's New
page and even a <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/schools.html">
registry</A> of all the K-12 schools on the Web.  This can be useful
because a teacher can look into how other classrooms and schools are
using the Web. Another example of Web resources is
<A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/k12menu.html"> Janice's
OUTPOST</A>.  Her K-12 Cyberspace OUTPOST contains group of very
helpful educational <A HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/vl.html">
virtual libraries</A> on the Web. One interesting and informative link
is called the <A HREF="http://eryx.syr.edu/COWSHome.html"> AskERIC
Virtual Library</A>. This Library contains everything from a complete 6
week lesson plan outline on
<A HREF="gopher://ericir.syr.edu/00/Lesson/Astronomy/Introduction">
Astrology</A>to great listed
 resources on mainstreaming gifted students.

<P>

An informative source for teachers would be the
<A HREF="http://www.cortland.edu/www_root/flteach/flteach.html">
FLTeach</A> page.  

This page 
supplies different information on foreign language teaching 
methods for high school and college educators.
A very informative site and good starting point for a
foreign language educator would be 
the<A HREF="http://www.itp.berkeley.edu/~thorne/HumanResources.html">
World Wide Web page of Foreign Language Resources</A>.  This site 
includes links all over the United States and 
the world. It contains information on many different foreign
 languages, from Hebrew to Chinese.

<P>

One interesting and informative Web page is 
that of the<A HREF="http://www.scri.fsu.edu/~dennisl/CMS.html">
Cyberspace Middle 
School</A>.

On this page you can find helpful information on Web magazines and a
special search engine on the web just for educators, called<A
HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/cisco/edu-arch.html"> CEARCH</A> in the
Cisco Educational Archive..  Now if you are looking for state of the
art development for education through computers the Web has information
available on that, also.  One study called Computer as<A
HREF="http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP.html"> Learning Partner
Project</A>(CLP) is actually founded by the National Science
Foundation.

This project, directed by Dr. Marcia Linn of Berkeley's Graduate School of
Education. attempts to help students with the conceptual complexities of
understanding science.  This project uses the computer to assist in
instruction.  CLP has become a complete physical science course being
offered at Foothill Middle School in Walnut Creek, CA.  RAND (Research and
Development) is a non-profit institute that that has seen the need for
computer teaching tools.  A system by the name of ARC/INFO ESSCOTS created
with the help of the<A HREF="http://www.rand.org/"> RAND</A> corporation,
allows junior high and high school students to propose statistical theories
and then examine them with easy-to-use graphical interfaces.

<P>

 Another project allows high school students to exchange text, data,
audio and video with other users.  This is the
<A
HREF="http://www.covis.nwu.edu/"> Learning through Collaborative
Visualization Project</A>(CoVis) supported by Ameritech and Bellcore
companies.  This educational network uses a standard of computing
usually only accesible to commercial networking.  

<P>
<H7> <B> <A NAME="#Activities">Interactive Classroom Activities</A> </B>  
</H7><P>
Nothing can
completely replace the hands-on traditional experiences that a
classroom and teacher are able to provide.
 With the computer and the communication attributes thereof, one can
communicate with other classrooms throughout the state and throughout
the world.


<P>

Teachers are now able to have contact with other teachers and exchange
innovative educational ideas, while students are capable of communicating
with other students all over the world.  By this communication they can
peer edit assignments or cultivate friendships.    The
<A
HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/ibahn.int4.html"> Internet</A> gives the
modern educator a new classroom tool.  This tool can become an educational
window to other cultures around the world.  For example at 
<A
HREF="http://www.ncook.k12.il.us/sp/sp_home_page.html"> John H. Springman
School</A> a teacher or school administrator can explore the teaching and
motivational philosophy of another school without actually visiting the
campus.  Students can talk to other students at the school and teachers can
also communicate and exchange ideas. On
<A
HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~sstrat/BestK12.html">
 Steve Stratford's home page</A> you and your students can look at schools
and their computer projects from around the world.  One can even look at a
classroom in Germany, view their class picture and be accessible to each
students very own home page.  St. Olaf College in Minnesota helps out with
the 
<A HREF="http://www.stolaf.edu/network/iecc/#subscribe"> Intercultural
E-Mail Classroom Connections</A> program.  A teacher can link themselves
and their classes to other classes in different countries, thereby exposing
their classes to other cultures.  One interesting site includes an 
interactive on-line discussion on <A 
HREF="http://ericir.syr.edu/Discovery/Promise/Welcome/welcomepage2.html">
AfroAmerican</A> 
migration form the Southern
States of the U.S., to Chicago from 1942 through 1970.  Interactive sites 
such as this one would greatly augment a unit on AfroAmerican History.  
Another site would tie in well with a unit on war. This page includes <A 
HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~sstrat/BestK12.html"> 
historical war stories</A> along with professional exhibits and pictures and 
memories from veterans.



<H5>
<a name="par"><b>Educational Uses for Parents</b></a></H5>

Parents as well as teachers are able to use the Internet to educate their
children.  The Internet can accommodate all ages of children in a variety
of different subjects.  A good place for parents to begin looking would
be in the <A HREF="
http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/fastindex.html">
Kids Web</a> which is a World Wide Web Digital Library for
Schoolkids.  In this directory one can choose from a multiplicity of
subjects to engage their children.



<P>
This particular Kids Web has many subject headings in the area of <A
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/art.html">art.</a>  As
well there are a vast majority of sciences that have to do with the <a
HREF="
http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/environment.html">environment,</a>
<a
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/physics.html">physics,</a>
<A HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/weather.html">
weather,</a> <a
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/biology.html">biology</a>
and the educational list continues.
This Kids Web also has directories pertaining to  Social Studies
and Miscellaneous themes.  Each one of these documents link to other
computers and documents that provides a vast array of incredible
information to
teach children.  This is why the Internet is called a web, the resource of
knowledge is never ending. <p>
<P>
<b>Simple Exploration</b>
<p>
   

A good way to start
is just simple exploration.  For example under the arts, <A
HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/artsedge/artsedge.html">(ArtsEdge)</a>
there are amazing pictures.  A child is
able to take a tour of the famous Louvre art gallery in Paris just by
sitting down at their computer. <a
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/drama.html">
 Dramas</a> can also be shown on the screen (although
this could take a long time to load onto one's computer depending on the
type of computer and it's speed).  The subject of sciences can take a
child through museums and show them pictures of <A
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/dinosaurs.html">dinosaurs.</a>
Pictures of dinosaurs are only a few of the great online images available to
see, as well there are many types of birds, reptiles, amphibians,
insects or mammals to find.  In the area of social studies, children are
able
to look into information about our <a
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/government.html">government</a>
and the different branches that exist in
our judical system.  One's interest is continuously spurred when exploring
the Internet.  The Internet is a learning
experience for both the parent and the child.
   
<p>
The Internet also allows for parents to look into the methodology that other
model school
districts use. From on-line examples, parents can get a good feel  
for how others are choosing to educate their children.  A nice
example of this would be <A HREF="http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/>Princeton 
Regional Schools</a>.  This
school district has general information regarding the Internet.  If one
decides to explore this particular district, they will find the school's <a
HREF="http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/subjects/techmission.html">technology
Mission Statement</a>, about their newspaper, board policies, manuals and
a basic overall general <A
HREF="http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/Subjects/PHS_Profile.html>profile</a> of
the school.  This could be a very
beneficial way to learn about other schools and how parent involvement in
the schools could lead to the furthering of the education of our
children.
<p>
   
<B>New Software</B>   

<P>
There is more related software that parents have been
searching into for their children.  The Princeton school district K-12's 
home page refers to a lot of the software now being offered.  The WWW has
many different web
viewers and to accommodate them all, it needs to keep up on the new
software.  For example there is <A
HREF="http://home.mcom.com/MCOM/products_docs/index.html">Netscape</a>
which is able to show graphics, <a
HREF="file://www.prs.k12.nj.us/pub/Current
Mosaic Client/Helper Apps/Sparkle.hqx">Sparkle</a> which is able to 
show   
movies
online, <A HREF="file://www.prs.k12.nj.us/pub/Current Mosaic
Client/Helper Apps/SoundMachine.hqx">SoundMachine</a> and many others.
(Sparkle and SoundMachine can only be accessed with appropriate
equipment.)  All these extras are fun to
have and the functions  they contribute are amazing to watch on the
computer because the computer just seems to come to life.

<H6><a NAME="kid"><B>Educational Uses for Children</b></a></H6>
   
<p>

Computers are part of the future and children need to be familiar with
computers in this day and age.  Whether or not a child is playing games
or finding new and exciting web find, they are familiarizing themselves  
with the computer and it's many functions.
<p>
<b>Places for Kids to Start</B>
<p>
A fantastic directory with endless topics and links for children is <a
HREF="http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/kids.html#skip">Uncle Bob's Kids'
Page</a>. "This page is a treasure chest of links, which
have been cleaned, checked, and annotated, with spotlights on special
subject."  This is the introduction to Uncle Bob's Page that Bob Allison
(boba@wwa.com) created.  Within this directory there are spotlights on 
outer
space,
the grand canyon national park, Star Trek, pictures, upcoming, current
and recent events, Disney, NASA and much much more because these
highlights don't even scratch the surface of what there is to find.


<p>
There are many games to find in Uncle Bob's Page, but there are also many
other places to look.  <a
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/fun.html">Fun and
Games</a> in another particular directory contains <a
Href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Comics/">comics</a>
and many different varieties.  <a
HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Games/">Games</a>
also seem to be unlimited on the Internet.  There is everything from
Backgammon, Paintballs, Role Playing Games, Scrabble to Television Game
Shows.  The lists are numerous and on this homepage there are
the options of <a
HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Hobbies_and_Crafts/">hobbies a$

zines/">on-line magazines</a>.  Kids can be glued to the screen
for hours once they find this directory.
<p>
<b>Sports</b>
<p>


Another area that kids usually enjoy is the area of sports.  <A
HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Sports/">The Yahoo
Sports Page</a> is a fantastic place to start.  There is about 100
different sports that can be looked into.  Any of these sports will lead 
to a homepage where more can be researched or current news can be looked
up.  It contains sports from croquet, korfball, sumo, martial arts to
snow boarding.  It appears to be the "most comprehensive listing of
sports information available on the Internet." (Paul Coddington,
paulc@npac.syr.edu)


<p>
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/journalism/kid.html">KID</a> which   
stands for "Kids Internet Delight" is one more site that children might  
really enjoy.  This directory is basically an index of an array of different
information for children to search.  Learning can be fun on a computer
but there are also many areas that children can explore that may not be
something that parent feel suitable for their children to view.  With young
children it is
recommended that parents monitor and help their child while exploring the
web.  Searching the web is definitely an educational experience for
children regardless of their age and the familiarity with a computer will
be helpful to them in the future.

<p>
<H7><A=Name"conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></a></H7>
<p>
Exploring the Internet leads to many educational finds.  Teachers,
Parents and Children are each able to resource particular areas to
accommodate their needs.  Teachers can use the web for informational
ideas in helping to more effectively teach their children.  Parents are
able to get involved with their children's learning process by actively
finding interesting topics or pictures.  Children are able to explore a
wide range of exciting themes, games, sports and much more.  The Internet
is growing daily and has so much knowledge to offer the world that it is
important to get involved.  The Internet will be a leading source of  
knowledge in the future and it is important to get children involved.  
Teachers and Parents have the opportunity to be a part of it and 
educate   
the future generations.
