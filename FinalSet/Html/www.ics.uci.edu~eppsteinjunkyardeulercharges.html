<h1>Euler's Formula,
Proof 6: Electrical Charge
</H1>

This proof is due to <a href="refs.html#Thu">Thurston</a>.
He writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arrange the polyhedron in space so that no edge is horizontal -- in
particular, so there is exactly one uppermost vertex U and lowermost
vertex L.
<P>
Put a unit + charge at each vertex, a unit - charge at the center of
each edge, and a unit + charge in the middle of each face.  We will show
that the charges all cancel except for those at L and at U.  To do this,
we displace all the vertex and edge charges into a neighboring face, and
then group together all the charges in each face.  The direction of
movement is determined by the rule that each charge moves horizontally,
counterclockwise as viewed from above.

In this way, each face receives the net charge from an open interval
along its boundary.  This open interval is decomposed into edges and
vertices, which alternate.  Since the first and last are edges, there is
a surplus of one -; therefore, the total charge in each face is zero.
All that is left is +2, for L and for U.

Thurston goes on to generalize this idea to a proof that the
<a href="http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/10001.4-7.shtml">Euler characteristic</a>
is an invariant of any triangulated differentiable manifold.
