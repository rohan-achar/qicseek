&gt;Jim's subject line makes the issue seem one of taste

No... just an attempt to inject some humor into an otherwise serious post.
Name space munging has the same negative connotations as URL "decorations,"
as if a URL was a Christmas tree... :-)

&gt;To that end, I suggest that we decorate the version number with version=,
&gt;so that
&gt;
&gt;        <a href="http://host/dir/projectX/1.5/Macintosh/French/file.c">http://host/dir/projectX/1.5/Macintosh/French/file.c</a>
&gt;
&gt;becomes:
&gt;
&gt;        <a href="http://host/dir/projectX/version=1.5/Macintosh/French/file.c">http://host/dir/projectX/version=1.5/Macintosh/French/file.c</a>
&gt;
&gt;Aesthetics aside, this works.

This is better, although it seriously increases the length of URLs.  And if
we're going to do this, I'd prefer to see something like:

   <a href="http://host/dir/projectX/Macintosh;version=1.5/French/file.c">http://host/dir/projectX/Macintosh;version=1.5/French/file.c</a>

This still handles the "surfing" requirement that seems to be so compelling.

&gt;
&gt;| 2)  Competing name space semantics: What gives us the right to partition
&gt;| the name space for HTTP servers which employ versioning?  How can we
&gt;
&gt;We're not seizing rights here, we're establishing a convention.
&gt;Admittedly, even /version=_version_/ takes away from the namespace
&gt;freedom of the HTTP servers, albeit less than simply /_version_/.

This dodges my main point: how can we guarantee there won't be collisions
between our convention, and other existing conventions.  Given the scope of
the proposed convention, I find the likelihood of collisions to be high,
and gave an example of an entire class of existing namespaces which may
cause problems.

&gt;
&gt;| 4) The main benefit of placing version identifiers into the name space,
&gt;| "surfing" into the past via relative URLs, does not work.  One scenario
&gt;| outlines this:
&gt;|
&gt;| <a href="http://foo.bar.com/1.5/A.html">http://foo.bar.com/1.5/A.html</a>  (where 1.5 is the version id) contains a
&gt;| relative URL of GIF "../background.gif."  In this case, version 1.5 of
&gt;| background.gif would also be retrieved.  However, experience to date with
&gt;| versioning systems shows that all objects are not versioned at the same
&gt;| rate.
&gt;
&gt;First, if the _version_ identifier is something other than a revision
&gt;number, this works a whole lot better:
&gt;
&gt;        <a href="http://foo.bar.com/brochure/version=_symbolic-label_/A.html">http://foo.bar.com/brochure/version=_symbolic-label_/A.html</a>
&gt;
&gt;allows A.html to include a relative gif of "background.gif" and get the
&gt;desired version, whatever its revision number may be.
&gt;
&gt;Second, if you allow /version=_version_/ to appear anywhere in the path,
&gt;then the aware server can have it where it most makes sense.  For example,
&gt;
&gt;        <a href="http://foo.bar.com/brochure/A.html/version=1.15">http://foo.bar.com/brochure/A.html/version=1.15</a>
&gt;

I don't think you can just allow /version=_version_/ to appear either
before or after the resource without affecting the semantics of it.  The
way I read your comments, having the /version=_version_/ before the
resource is giving the version id of a *collection* of resources, while
having /version=_version_/ after the resource is simply specifying the
version id of the resource itself.  These are not the same.

Plus, I still don't think this works.  Here's another example:

resource A.html has 3 versions: A.html,1.0; A.html,2.0; A.html;2.1
resource B.html has 2 versions: B.html,1.0; B.html,2.0
resource logo.gif has 2 versions: logo.gif,1.0; logo.gif,2.0

The latest version of resource A.html is version 2.1, and includes version
2.0 of logo.gif using a relative URL.  The latest version of resource
B.hmtl is version 2.0, which also includes version 2.0 of logo.gif using a
relative URL.

To make the name space work, you'd have:

<a href="http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/A.html">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/A.html</a>
<a href="http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.0/B.html">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.0/B.html</a>

But wait ... the relative URL in A.html will try to get the 2.1 version of
logo.gif, which doesn't exist!  Assuming you mean that the version=2.1
really refers to a collection of resources, I'll assume you can add a
symbolic link to version 2.0 of logo.gif into the version=2.1 collection.
At this point, let me introduce resource C.html, which, like A.html, has
three versions, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.1.  As you might imagine, C.html also
includes logo.gif, but C.html is an older page which has not been updated
recently, and hence includes logo.gif version 1.0. So the URL for C.html
is:

<a href="http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html</a>

Utilizing the solution of adding a symbolic link to logo.gif, version 1.0
into collection "version=2.1", we suddenly realize that a symbolic link to
logo.gif already exists (left over from adding the link to version 2.0 of
logo.gif for A.html version 2.1).  This is a problem.

On the other hand, if the versions (i.e.,
..../version=_version_/resource.html) do not actually refer to collections,
but instead refer just to the object one heirarchy down, then there are
still problems.  A new version 2.1 of logo.gif, a copy of version 2.0,
could be made so that A.html would retrieve the right version, but C.html,
version 2.1 just simply would be unable to get version 1.0 of logo.gif,
because the version 2.1 name for logo.gif has already been taken by a copy
of version 2.0 of logo.gif.

&gt;The whole point is to allow version-naive clients to surf.  If this is not
&gt;as important as I think it is, then maybe we don't need to go to such lengths
&gt;to solve the problem.

I think it is an important problem.  But I also think we shouldn't
partition the namespace in a way which causes other problems due to
namespace collisions, and restrictions on the versions of entities which
may be accessed.

I strongly feel the text/config MIME type approach is the best one for
handling browsing of collections of versioned objects.
