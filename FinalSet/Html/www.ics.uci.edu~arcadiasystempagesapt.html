APT (APPL/A translator)
<P>
<LI> <i>Source:</i><BR>
University of Colorado Arcadia Project.
<P>
<LI> <i>Brief description:</i><BR>
Apt translates programs written in a subset of the APPL/A
	software-process programming language into an equivalent Ada 
	program that may be compiled and executed.  Available in two
	versions:
	<UL><LI> APPLA_to_Ada:  translates APPL/A directly to Ada
	   <LI> A combination of two tools, APPLA_to_IRISand IRIS_to_Ada,
	         where the IRIS intermediate form is saved in persistent
                 repositories. 
	</UL>
<P>
<LI> <i>Evaluation against applicable general dimensions:</i>
<P>
<OL><LI> <i>Availability: commercial/licensed/public domain</i><BR>
Public domain.
<P>
<LI> <i>Cost:</i><BR>
None; it can be made available via anonymous FTP.
<P>
<LI> <i>Degree of support/maturity/testing/usage:</i><BR>
The support provided for Apt is very limited.
	Only major bugs will be fixed.
	Apt is currently considered stable and no enhancements are planned.
	It is reasonably robust and has been in daily use in Arcadia
	for several years to support Rebus, Debus, and a management process
	program.
<P>
<LI> <i>Speed:</i><BR>
For the APPL/A-to-Ada version:  50 lines/second.
	With persistent intermediate IRIS:  approximately 10 lines/minute.
<P>
<LI> <i>Computing platforms:</i><BR>
It is known to work on Sun 3s and Sparcs.
	No others have been attempted.
<P>
	Required Support Systems:  None to simply run the translators.
<P>
	Required libraries/tools for rebuilding the translators:
	In addition to the Ada source code:
	<OL><LI> The original versions of Alex and Ayacc
	<LI> The Napa-IRIS version of the IRIS development tools
	<LI> Standard Ada compiler (Verdix or Sunada preferred)
	</OL>
	With the exception of the Ada compiler, these are all available
	through the Arcadia Consortium.
<P>
	Required libraries and support systems for the compilation and use
	of translated programs (i.e., the Ada source programs resulting from
	the translation of APPL/A source by APT):  An additional runtime
	support package, event server, and Q RPC/XDR libraries.  All are
	available through the Arcadia Consortium.
<P>
<LI> <i>Language compatibilities:</i><BR>
Apt is written in standard Ada and
	Apt translates into standard Ada.
<P>
<LI> <i>Footprint:</i><BR>
Unknown.
<P>
<LI> <i>Openness/integrability/source availability:</i><BR>
Source is freely available.
<P>
<LI> <i>Extensibility:</i><BR>
It is reasonably understandable for someone knowledgeable
	about Ada and the Arcadia IRIS toolset.
<P>
<LI> <i>Pedigree: ARPA developed?</i><BR>
Developed by the ARPA-sponsored Arcadia project.
