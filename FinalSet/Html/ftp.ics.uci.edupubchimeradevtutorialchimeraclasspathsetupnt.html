<H2>Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include chimera.jar</H2>

<p>&nbsp;
This section will explain how to set the CLASSPATH environment variable
to include chimera.jar. CLASSPATH is used by the Java interpretor to
determine where it looks for Java byte-code.  Since the server programs 
that make up Chimera 2.0 are in chimera.jar, you need to set CLASSPATH
to the location of chimera.jar.
</p>

<H3>Setting the CLASSPATH Environment Variable</H3>

<p> Follow the following steps to access the area in NT where the
environment variables are located.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Open the Control Panel.
        <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_settings.gif" WIDTH="286"

    <li> Double click the System icon from the Control Panel window.
        <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_control_panel.gif" WIDTH="475"
        HEIGHT="394"></CENTER>
	The Systems Properties window should appear.  

    <li> Click on the Environment tab.  This will display the
        information about the environment variables used.
        <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_environment.gif" WIDTH="408"
        HEIGHT="465"></CENTER>
	Add the variable CLASSPATH and type in the path to the location of 
	chimera.jar in the value field. 
	(Note: This image does not show chimera.jar being added 
	to the CLASSPATH variable.  Be sure to type in the proper path
	for your system.)
</ol>

<p> You now have the chimera.jar file set for your Java interpretor.
