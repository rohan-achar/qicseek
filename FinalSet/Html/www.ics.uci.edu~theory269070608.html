<h1>Optimal-time Dynamic Mesh Refinement</h1>

<h2>Benoit Hudson</h2>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>In February, Gary Miller presented our results on static mesh
refinement: the problem was to, given an input geometry, produce an
output tetrahedral mesh where every tetrahedron has good aspect ratio.
This requires adding some additional points to the input; he showed how
to minimize (to within a constant factor) the number of points in the
output, and how to run in optimal sequential time.</p>

<p>When the mesh domain changes after the first timestep, we now need to
solve the dynamic mesh refinement problem: how to maintain a small but
good quality mesh as we change the input.  I will show that after
addding or removing points from the input, the mesh refinement algorithm
of Bern, Eppstein, and Gilbert can recompute the output quality mesh in
O(log&nbsp;<i>L</i>/<i>s</i>) time.  This uses the automatic
dynamization techniques of Acar, which ensures that the dynamic
algorithm is no harder to implement than the static algorithm.</p>

<p>In two dimensions, we can extend this to do even better: by
dynamizing a post-processing algorithm of Har-Peled and Ungor, we can
maintain a mesh as small as is known how to produce in practice, at no
additional asymptotic cost.</p>

<p>I expect this joint work with Umut Acar (TTI-C) to be of particular
interest to geometers, dynamic algorithmaticians, and scientific
computers.</p>
