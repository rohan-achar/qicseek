ROLES
</UL><UL>
Roles are problematic, because roles become very programmatic.  For example, you could have some kind of role/permission to state that �after the editor has edited the document, the individual marked as reviewer in such-and-such a database now has the role of reviewer for this document.
</UL><UL>
E.g. �lisadu� has role of �approver� on this expense item folder
</UL><UL>
This can be done without changling acls:  two steps.
</UL><UL>
1.  First look up who is the �approver� of the document or folder, or some other role stored as a property or looked up in a DB.
</UL><UL>
2.  Then assign the rights on the object based on the look-up.  </UL> </P>
