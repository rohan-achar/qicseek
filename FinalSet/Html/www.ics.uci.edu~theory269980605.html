<p>A video-on-demand (VOD) server is a place where hundreds or
thousands of movie files are stored, and movie watchers (clients)
can connect their own machines to the server to browse, request and
view the movies immediately . There are many challenges to a VOD
server, and load balancing is the most important one. A server must
have movie files organized in such a way that all clients can view
the movies they want, regardless of the number of clients who are
online. There may be peak time periods when many clients want to
view the same movie, and the server must send different phases of
the same movie file to them, since the clients do not all request
the movie at the same time. The server must also minimize the
waiting time for each client. The cost must be kept low, but the
number of files and bandwidth must be large enough to service all
clients promptly. The goal of load balancing is to maximize the
ratio of the number of concurrent streams over the cost of the
server.</p>

<p>Another challenge is the online functionalities at the client's
end. A client must be able to perform the VCR-like functions, such
as fast-forward, rewind, pause, etc... on the movies they are
viewing, the same way as when they rent and watch a video tape with
their VCR. Therefore, it's not enough if a steady stream of movie
file comes to their house without the client being able to
interfere with it.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will survey a number of articles which appeared
recently about this type of multimedia. These are the contributions
by the people who have studied the details of a VOD server, the
problems that are involved, and the solutions for those
problems.</p>
