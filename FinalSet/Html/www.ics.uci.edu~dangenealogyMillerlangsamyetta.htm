I just found some of your correspondence. My father was born in Sanok, 
Poland in
1906. His mother's
maiden name was Yetta Langsam. Are we related?

Hi,
    My father's name was Harry(Zvi). He was one of eight children.
My grandfather's name was Abraham. I'm sorry but I don't know
my greatgrandparents' names.

:Hi,
:I would still like to find our relationship. Can you provide any more
:detail, like your father's name or Yetta's parent's names, or any of
:Yetta's siblings.
:Yetta Langsam is too slim to go on. There are over 14,000 known
descendents
:to Pesach Langsam (c1748-1820).
:Any input would be appreciated.
:Thanks!
