Title: Parallel Processing, A Way to Reduce Wall Clock Time
<br>
Speaker: Josiah Carlson</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
There are many areas of computer science in which the time to complete a
computation can be overwhelming.  Through the use of various parallel
processing techniques, some of which are available at UCI, you may be
able to reduce your processing time to a tolerable length.  This talk
isn't meant to dive into anything theoretically intense, but is mostly
to give an introduction and a bit of background to those who have had
little exposure to parallel processing and what it entails.
