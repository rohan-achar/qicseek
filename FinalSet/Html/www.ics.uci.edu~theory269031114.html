Power-Aware Routing Algorithms for Sensor Networks - A Brief Survey
<br>
John Augustine
</H3>
<p>
Sensor networks pose challenging design limitations that often require
re-working of well researched problems. This talk will deal with one
such issue, namely the limited amount of power in a battery powered node
in the network. Traditional routing algorithms may drain a crucial node
in the network that might have several debilitating effects on the
network at large. Several system level researchers have started studying
this problem producing interesting results, both empirically and
theoretically. This talk will be a survey of these results.
