This assignment corresponds to the initialcoding phase, unit testing, and debugging. The next assignment correspondsto software integration, integration and system testing, debugging, andenhancements.&nbsp; In conjunction with coding each unit, your team mustdevelop unit test plans covering each of the implemented units.<P>For this assignment, you must turn in both a descriptive document andcode listings as described below. The source code should be documentedwith sufficient, informative comments. Theunit test plans and test execution histories should functionally test each unit in the implementation. You should organizethe unit test plans and test history documentation in much the same wayas the units themselves are organized in the implementation. You need notprint out the results of all testing activity, but should show enough resultsof executing your unit test plans to convince us that your units are readyfor integration.<P>Specify the correspondence between your software design and the implementation.Show this correspondence any way you feel is appropriate (e.g., make notationsthroughout your document or in your minutes), but by all means includesome discussion in the overview section. Implementing the software willundoubtedly reveal inadequacies in previous documents. Please note theseproblems and what was done to solve them.<P>Don't forget to include your meeting minutes and performance appraisalswith your document; refer to the syllabus for the complete check-list ofwhat has to be turned in.<BR><HR><H3>Deliverable Objectives/Quality</H3>Keep in mind that key objectives of the implementation are to:<UL><LI> Translate the design into code that will satisfy requirements</LI><LI> Identify inadequacies in the design and requirements</LI><LI> Document further decisions and rationale</LI><LI> Provide a reference tool readable by developers, testers, and maintainers</LI></UL>In addition, keep in mind that an implementation document should satisfythe following qualities:<UL><LI> Complete? everything that is in the requirements and design is implemented</LI><LI> Consistent? no mismatched interfaces and consistent with the design</LI><LI> Stylistic? exhibits good programming style<BR>  (e.g., safe constructs, information hiding, well defined types, reasonablemodule sizes and complexity, well-defined module interfaces, avoids sideeffects)</LI><LI> Understandable? code should be constructed that is easy to read, not necessarilly  easy to write</LI><LI> Modifiable? again this is a living document</LI><LI> Desensitized to change? maintains information hiding as specified in thedesign</LI><LI> Confirmable, Verifiable and testable? you can tell when you've met thedesign and requirements</LI></UL><HR><H3> Document Contents</H3><H4>Introduction</H4>Expand your introduction to discuss your specific approaches to the implementationof the system and the organization of this document. This description isessentially just an updated version of the introduction you included inyour previous deliverable. This description should guide the reader.<H4>Understanding</H4>If needed, expand the understanding section of your previous document. Make sureto add descriptions of what additional steps or actions you took to understandeach technology or software during this phase. If you make changes to this section,add text describing why the change was necessary, and why it more accuratelyreflects your new understanding. This section need not be different ifyour understanding hasn't changed.<H4>Project Plan</H4>This will be an iterative expansion of your previous submission. Expandyour project plan to represent how you have accomplished the work so far.Reassess the project risks. Expand your task network or work breakdownstructure to include the effort expended to complete this task. Based onthe work you have done, revise your estimates on how much your team canaccomplish and deliver.  Update your time estimates for the remainingwork.<P>If you make changes, add text describing why the change was necessaryor why it will improve the ability of your team to accomplish the workyou have proposed.<H4>Implementation</H4><UL><LI> Overview of Software Implementation</LI>  <UL>  <LI> Implementation organization</LI>  <LI> System size (e.g., source lines, packages) (See the note below under the	 presentation instructions for how to show this.)</LI>  <LI> Major limitations on the current implementation</LI></UL><LI> Source Code Listings</LI>   <UL>   <LI> List of Modules/Objects within your system</LI>   <LI> Complete listings for your software system.</LI>       <UL>       <LI> Listings should be free of syntax errors</LI>       <LI> Each module/object must be documented in standard ways, defining its purpose,            how it works, and interface (this should be straight out of the design)</LI>       </UL>   </UL></UL><H4>Unit Test Plan/Test History</H4>Includes a unit test plans capable of demonstrating that each unit meetsthe design and requirements traceable to that unit. The unit test plansshould be based on  functional test heuristics based on the functionaldescription of the unit (black box).<P>Shows selected results of your testing activity, enough to raise ourconfidence in your software and to show that it is ready for integrationand final testing. In particular, you should show a representative selectionof test results for each unit test plan. The test results should show thetest case executed, whether any failures were detected, what faults weredebugged, and (hopefully) that it eventually passed.<UL><LI> Unit Test Plan / Test Execution History ... for each test case</LI>   <UL>   <LI> Test Case Identification</LI>   <LI> Purpose of Test Case</LI>   <LI> Item(s) being tested</LI>   <LI> Input specification</LI>   <LI> Output specification</LI>      <UL>      <LI> Expected Results or Test Oracle Mechanism</LI>      </UL>   <LI> Test environmental needs or special test procedures</LI>   </UL>   <HR WIDTH="100%">   <UL>   <LI> Test Results</LI>      <UL>      <LI> pass/fail</LI>      </UL>   <LI> Failures detected</LI>   <LI> Faults debugged</LI>   <LI> Final Test Result</LI>      <UL>      <LI> hopefully passed ... but if not fixed, document this</LI>      </UL>   </UL></UL><H4>Demonstration Plan (Update)</H4>How and what will you demonstrate?

If your requirementshave not changed, then so state.<H4>Glossary (Update)</H4>Defines any terms used in the specifications above.<H4> Documentation (Update)</H4>This section is reserved for any additional documentation you may havedeveloped during this phase of the project. Specifically, if during thecourse of developing the your understanding of the various technologiesinvolved in the project, you discovered items that were not documented,but which were important, then you should include that here.<hr><H3> Implementation Presentations </H3>March 5th.<p>Each team should prepare a 20 minute presentation. Your presentation should include  the following:<UL><LI> Very brief context to your project;</LI><LI> Current state of your project plan. Be sure to include a table showing how many hours were originally planned for each phase and how many hours you actually spent on each phase.  Forphases where there is a large difference (>25%) provide an explanation.</LI><LI> <strong>Highlights</strong> of your implementation including</LI>  <UL>   <LI> an overview of your architecture</LI>   <LI> one or more module/object implementations and associated unit test plans;</LI>   <LI> requirements and design cross reference for the highlighted code;</LI>   </UL><li> A description of how many lines of code you've written, how many files they are in,and how those files are organized.  A good way of showing this is as a tree reflectingthe file/directory structure, with each leaf node annotated with the number of lines of codein that node, and each non-leaf node annotated with the aggregate number of source linesin all subsidiary directories and files.<LI> Any significant modifications to your requirements or design that arose  as a result of your coding.</LI></UL>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>
