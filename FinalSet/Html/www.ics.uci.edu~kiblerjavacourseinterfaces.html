<h1> Interfaces </h1>
 Problem: Suppose we have a collection of shapes and
 we want to sort them by their area.

<p> Solution 1:   expand the definition of shape 

<pre>
  abstract class Shape
     { 
       double area();
       double perimeter();
       boolean lessThan(Shape shape)
     {
       return area() < shape.area() ;  // don't forget about implicit this.
     }
       void sort(Vector of shapes)
      {
          code for sorting
       }
     }
   No changes to other code.
</pre>

<p>This will work, but now we can only sort shapes. Our same
sort routine will not work for  addresses or any other objects.

<p> The C++ solution would be to allow multiple inheritance, 
  but Java doesn't have multiple inheritance.

<p>  The Java solution is to use interfaces, which 
    provide a limited type of multiple inheritance.

<h2> Sketch of Java Solution using interfaces </h2>

<pre>
     interface Sortable
    {   
     boolean lessThan(Sortable o);
     void sort(Sortable objects);
    }
     class Shape implements Sortable
    {
        
        
      ..as before
      boolean lessThan(Sortable s)
      {
         return area() < s.area() ;
      }
  
     no change to other classes
     }
</pre>

<h3> Interface Summary </h3>
<ul>
   <li> Interfaces support programming by contract, one of the
    principles in object-oriented design.
   <li> Interfaces are design artifacts, while classes mix design
     and implementation.
   <li> An interface has no member or static member functions, only
   function prototypes.
   <li> An interface may have data members, which are automatically
  static and final but some compilers may require you to declare this.
   <li> Interfaces provide a limited form of multiple inheritance.
   <li> Interfaces collect partial similarities between dissimilar objects.
    It is would be strange to force all sortable objects into a hierarchy.
   <li> Provides contracts for concrete classes to implement.
   <li> Promotes hiding of irrelevant procedures.
   <li> Promotes uniformity of code, increasing simplicity. 
   <li> A class can <em> implement </em> any number of interfaces.
   <li> You cannot inherit methods from an interface.
   <li> An interface may extend other interfaces.
</ul>
<h3> Standard Interface Enumeration </h3>
 This interface is in java.util.*.
  <pre>

     public abstract interface Enumeration
  {
     public abstract boolean hasMoreElements();
     public abstract Object nextElement() throws NoSuchElementException;
  }
 </pre>
<h3> Example use of Enumeration </h3>

 <pre>
      Vector v = new Vector();
      ... fill up v with Shape objects
      Enuermation e = v.elements();
      while (e.hasMoreElements())
        {
          Shape temp = (Shape) v.nextElement();  // note cast
          ... process temp
        }
 </pre>
   

<ul>
  <li> Interfaces permit increased comprehensibility and code sharing.
  <li>Any class that implements this interface needs to define the
   two methods above. 
  <li> StringTokenizer implements Enumeration
  <li> Vector has a method elements() which returns an Enumeration.
</ul>
<h3>Complete Sortable Example  </h3>
This code illustrates appropriate commenting style. Comments of
the form //.. are explanatory and should not be included in the usual
code. This code also illustrates a few of the javadoc commands. Javadoc
commands are embedded in the comments and are preceded by @. This will
generate documentation similar to that of Sun's Java.api's.

<pre>
package DataStructures;   //.. this allows you bundle related class 
                         //.. and access them via import
public interface Sortable
{
  /**
  * Returns 0 if objects equal,
  * Returns value less than 0, if object is < tobeCompared
  * Returns value greater than 0, if object is > tobeCompared
  * @param toBeCompared is the object to be compared
 */

  public double compare(Sortable toBeCompared);
}

package DataStructures;
import java.util.Vector;   //.. that's all were using from java.util

public class Sort
{
  /*
   * Sorts a vector using bubbleSort.
   * Bubble sort is best if number of elements is small or
   * is elements are "almost" sorted.
   * In worst case, bubble-sort is quadratic in number of elements.
   * @param toBeStored is vector of sortable objects.
  */
public static void swap(Object o1, Object o2)
{
    Object temp = o1.clone();  //.. Why  necessary? Efficiency? 
    o1 = o2;
    o2 = temp;
}

public static void bubbleSort(Vector toBeSorted)
{
  int n = tobeSorted.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < n;  i++)
     for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
       if ( toBeSorted.elementAt(j).compare(toBeSorted.elementAt(i) ) < 0)  
              swap(toBeSorted.elementAt(i),toBeSorted.element(j));
}
    
package DataStructures;
 /*
 * Class that implements sortable double
 */

public class SortDouble implements Sortable
{
  /* Constructs a SortDouble  object
   * @param val is double value
  */

  public SortDouble(double val)
  {
     this.value = val;
  }
  public double val()
 {
    return value;
 }

 public double compare(Sortable toBeCompared)
 {
   return value - ((SortDouble) toBeCompared).val());
 }

 public boolean equals(Object toBeCompared)
 {
  return value == ((SortDouble) toBeCompare).val();
 }

}
</pre>

<h3> Packages </h3>
 <ul>
    <li> A package is a collection of (usually) related classes and interfaces.
    <li> The package name must be the same as the directory name, and
      packages follow the directory structure. 
    <li> At  most one package per directory.
    <li> If you do not define classes to belong to a package, then
      they belong to an anonymous package common to the current  directory.
    <li> The java compiler automatically imports the package java.lang.*
    and the anonymous package.
    <li> Packages are the method by which Java implements namespaces.
    <li> The package java.util.* contains a number of miscellaneous
     useful functions.
    <li> Packages are created by prepending the line
<br>   package packagename;
 <br> before your class definition.
    <li> To use classes provided in JDK, you begin your code with
      <br> import packagename;
    <li> For example, the Date class is in java.util. To use this
    class in your code, you use:
  <br> import java.util.*;
    <li> Any class which is designated as belonging to a package X
    has access to all other classes of package X. It is as if
    "package X;" expanded to "import X; package X;".
   <li> The package java.lang.* contains the classes for
  Object, Process, String, System, Thread, Wrappers, Boolean, Character, etc.
  Since these classes are almost always used, java automatically
   loads this package.
  <li> Import is not the same as include in C or C++. Import defines
    where to look for class definitions; none are loaded unless used.
  <li> In order to share classes that you have created, you need
   to properly set your CLASSPATH variable. This will be covered in
  the lab as it is system dependent.
  </ul>
