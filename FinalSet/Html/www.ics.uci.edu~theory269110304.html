<h1>Pairing Heaps: Where are they now?</h1>
<h2>Darren Strash, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>The pairing heap is a meldable heap data structure by Fredman,
Sedgewick, Sleater, and Tarjan, which is intended to be a practical
alternative to Fibonacci heaps. Experimental analysis shows that pairing
heaps meet their intended purpose: they are quite efficient in practice;
however, a precise amortized analysis of pairing heaps has proved
difficult. In this talk, I will discuss the pairing heap data structure
and the progress that has been made toward its analysis. I conclude by
discussing a variant of the pairing heap by Amr Elmasry ("<a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4130">Pairing Heaps with Costless
Meld</a>", ESA 2010) that matches known lower bounds.</p>
