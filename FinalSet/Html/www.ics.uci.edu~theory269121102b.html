<h1>
Algorithms for Graphs via Orthogonal Range Searching
</h1>
<h2>
Sergio Cabello 
</h2>
<p>
I will explain how orthogonal range searching has been useful to
improve the running time of algorithms solving the following
problems:
<br>
a) Computing the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices
in a graph of bounded treewidth.
<br>
b) Computing the dilation of a geometric graph of bounded treewidth.
<br>
c) Computing an optimal pricing in the Stackelberg shortest path tree
game.
</p>

(Parts a) and b) are joint work with Christian Knauer.)
