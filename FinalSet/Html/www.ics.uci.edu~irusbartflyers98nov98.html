<EM><strong><font size=+1>Application of Data Mining to Information Access 
on the Internet</em></strong></em><br>

Data mining has become an active area of research, attracting people from 
several disciplines: database systems, artificial intelligence, statistics, 
information retrieval, and data visualization. Data mining products and 
toolkits are now commercially available, and serious industrial applications 
are being developed. This talk will provide a brief overview of data mining, 
and then focus on applications of data mining to facilitating information 
access on the Internet. On-going research projects at HP Labs in the areas 
of collaborative filtering, electronic business, and customer support will 
be used to illustrate the concepts and techniques.

<EM><strong><font size=+1>The Pointcast Network: Broadcasting News on the 
Internet</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

PointCast Inc., the inventor and leader in broadcast news via the 
Internet and corporate intranets, delivers news as it happens from 
leading sources such as CNN and the New York Times directly to a viewer's 
computer screen. The PointCast Network is an integrated client/server 
system which gives users control of selecting kinds of information the 
client retrieves and the frequency of those retrievals. PointCast Client 
runs on the user's computer and retrieves information from the Central 
Broadcasting Facility which is composed of multiple sites geographically 
distributed over the US, each carrying a number of web servers called 
"PointServers". PointServers are highly customized and "infinitely" 
scalable to serve close to 200 million requests in a day. The PointCast 
Network receives content from about 600 different sources via satellite 
links or the internet. A cluster of servers runs customized processes 
round the clock to assimilate data from various sources.

This presentation will describe the basic plumbing of the PointCast 
Network including:

<ul>
<li>fault tolerance 
<li>load balancing 	
<li>achieving scalability through pre-caching on servers
<li>packaging information to optimize internet bandwidth usage
<li>minimizing data latency
</ul></li>
