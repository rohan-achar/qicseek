I can't resist posting a related problem.  By a hexahedron we mean any
convex polyhedron in R^3 combinatorially equivalent to a cube; that
is, a polyhedron with six quadrilateral faces meeting three at each
corner.  Assume that three of the four body diagonals meet at a common
point.  Prove that all four of the body diagonals meet at a common
point.

This has applications to how many projective toric varieties can have
a (combinatorial equivalent of the) octahedron as their image under
the moment map.
