On the Number of Arrangements of Pseudolines<br>
<a href="/~javid/">Javid H&uuml;seynov</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>An arrangement of pseudolines is a family of pseudolines with
the property that each pair of pseudolines has a unique point of
intersection where two pseudolines cross. An arrangement is simple
if no 3 pseudolines have a common point of intersection.</p>

<p>S.Felsner in his paper "On the number of arrangements of
pseudolines" presented an enumeration of simple arrangements of 10
pseudolines. This enumeration became an addition to the previous
enumerations of simple arrangements on up to 9 pseudolines (due to
Knuth).</p>

<p>I will also briefly talk about my work on enumeration of
arrangements of up to 12 pseudolines.</p>
