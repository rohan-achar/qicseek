<H1>GraphTool: A Tool for Interactive Design and Manipulation of Graphs and
Graph Algorithms</H1>
<HR>
<P><B>GraphTool</B> is an interactive tool for editing graphs and visualizing
the execution and results of graph algorithms.
It runs under the X Windows environment and has full window/mouse interface.
While the primary purpose of <B>GraphTool</B> is to provide a means for
experimentally investigating the performance of graph algorithms, it has other
useful features as well.
It provides features for printing graphs in a visually appealing format, which
makes it easier to prepare papers for publication.
It also provides a facility for "animating" algorithms, which means that it can
be used in computer assisted instruction (CAI) and for preparing video
presentation of algorithms.
<A HREF="#references">Much more information</A> about <B>GraphTool</B> is
available.
<A HREF="./xbt_gtool.zip">A SUN OS 4.x version</A> of <B>GraphTool</B> is
available.
In addition to the executable <code>xbt_gtool</code>, there is a library,
<code>graphtool.h</code> and <code>libgraphtool.a</code>, that handles many
common functions used in algorithms.
Algorithms are made visible to <B>GraphTool</B> by adding an entry for them in
the <code>.graphrc</code> file.
A sample <code>.graphrc</code> file, the source for its
<A HREF="#algorithms">algorithm entries</A>, and a <code>Makefile</code> have
all been included.

GraphTool has also been ported to run under the Windows '95 environment
</A>.</P>

<UL>
<LI> Random vertices
<LI> Voronoi diagram: compute Voronoi diagram, by first computing Delaunay
triangulation, using simple O(N**2) algorithm due to (I think) McLain, and then
taking dual.  This program also demonstrates how edge (node) colors become edge
styles (node patterns) in black and white.
<LI> Eucl Shortest Paths: compute shortest (Euclidean path in an undirected
graph.
Algorithm used is such that triangle inequality need not hold
(although in this case it does), but all weights must be positive.
<LI> Delaunay Tri: compute Delaunay triangulation, using simple O(N**2)
algorithm due to (I think) McLain.
<LI> Shortest Cycle: compute shortest weighted cycle in an undirected graph
by: For each edge, remove that edge, find shortest path through remaining
graph, add on edge length.
Algorithm used is such that triangle inequality need not hold
(although in this case it does), but all weights must be positive.
<LI> Shortest Nonfacial Cycle: compute shortest weighted cycle in an
undirected graph that is not the boundary of a face.
Algorithm used is such that triangle inequality need not hold
(although in this case it does), but all weights must be positive.
<LI> Display Faces and Weights: display each face and the sum of the weights
of the vertices incident on the face.
Useful for checking the validity of Rivin-Smith (inscribability) weightings.
<LI> Display Min, Max weights, sums: compute facts about weights, including:
max edge weight, min edge weight, max face sum and min face sum
<LI> flipdt: compute Delaunay triangulations by edge flipping.
Use greedy (queuing) strategy, for now.
<LI> sweeptri: compute plane-sweep (left-to-right) triangulation.
<LI> bipartite: find a bipartite subgraph with many edges, using a greedy
heuristic.
<LI> Bipartite Matching: bipartite matching using Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.
The algorithm first colors the graph, then does the matching.
<LI> Extreme Edges: compute longest and shortest edges
<LI> Geometric MST: compute geometric minimum spanning tree, using dumb
algorithm.
<LI> Hamiltonian Cycle: check for Hamiltonian cycle, using slightly improved
brute force algorithm.
<LI> Total Edge Length: compute total edge length.
<LI> Convex Hull: compute convex hull, using Jarvis March.
<LI> Convex Layers: computer convex layers, by successive applications of
Jarvis March.
<LI> Remove Edges and unmarked vertices: strip all edges and all white
vertices, then color remaining vertices white.
<LI> Remove thin edges: delete all edges with width = 1.
