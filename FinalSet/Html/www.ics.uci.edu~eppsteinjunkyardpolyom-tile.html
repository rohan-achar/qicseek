&gt;    I was wondering about the ability to tile certain figures with
&gt;    polyominoes.  The figures I am interested in, with cartesian
&gt;    descriptions, are:

&gt;    rectangle (r)		[0, a] X [0, b]
&gt;    halfstrip (hs)		R+ X [0, b]
&gt;    strip (s)			R X [0, b]
&gt;    angled strip (as)		([0, a] X R+) U (R+ X [0, b])
&gt;    quadrant (q)		R+ X R+
&gt;    halfplane (hp)		R X R+
&gt;    three-quarter plane (tp)	(tp)(R X R+) U (R+ X R)
&gt;    plane (p)			R X R

you should read the following article:

 solomon golomb, tiling with polyominoes, journal of combinatorial
    theory, volume 1, (1966), pages 280-296.

he considers all the above possibilities (except for the three-quarter
plane), as well as the possibility that the polyomino tiles a larger
copy of itself.  from his examples, it's clear that he allows the use
of mirror images; however, the implications do not change under this
interpretation.  here's the diagram of implications he gives:

                            rectangle

                          /     |
                         /      |
                        /       v
                       /
                      /     half strip
                     /
                    /           |
                   /            |
                  /             v
                 /
               \/_          bent strip

            itself              |
                                |
              \                 v
               \
                \           quadrant &amp; strip
                 \
                  \        /              \
                   \      /                \
                   _\/  \/_                _\/

                   quadrant                 strip
                 
                          \               /
                           \             /
                           _\/         \/_

                              half plane

                                  |
                                  |
                                  v

                                plane

                                  |
                                  |
                                  v

                               nothing

most of the implications are immediate (e.g. quadrant ==&gt; half plane,
since the half plane may be tiled with two quadrants).  the only
non-obvious implications are:     itself ==&gt; quadrant,  and
                              bent strip ==&gt; (quadrant &amp;) strip.
i will leave these to the reader to prove.

if we add the "three-quarter plane" we have the implications:

          quadrant  ==&gt;  three-quarter plane  ==&gt;  plane

the first implication is immediate, but i need the axiom of choice
to deduce the second.  (if anyone can prove the second without the
axiom of choice, please let me and sci.math know.)  as a hint,
try to prove that if a polyomino can cover an N-by-N square for all N
(no overlap, and pieces may hang over the edges of the square), then
it tiles the plane.  i don't know if the implication 

              three-quarter plane  ==??==&gt;  half plane 

is valid, but there are a number of potential implications that
haven't yet been ruled out, even though there's no apparent reason
they should hold.  (e.g.  itself  ==??==&gt; rectangle)

[many lines deleted for brevity]

&gt;    I have been unable to find polyominoes in sets other than these
&gt;    five, or to fill in the ? in the above table.  There may be general

golomb classifies all (except the infamous y hexomino) polyominoes of
order <U>&lt;</U> 6, and finds that many of these sets are unrepresented.

&gt;    implications I have not worked out (e.g., does a polyomino tiling
&gt;    the half strip necessarily tile a rectangle?).  It would make an
&gt;    interesting study.

indeed.

Question:
=========
-- What are the prime rectangles for the one-sided 
Y-pentomino (.:..), L-pentomino (:...), and P-pentomino (::.)?
The case of the L-tetromino is solved.
Known prime rectangles:
  Y-pentomino: 5*10
  L-pentomino: 2*5
  P-pentomino: 2*5

-- Why is there no 8*5n rectangle tileable with Y-pentominoes?

-- Where are the prime hyperboxes?
-- Is there anyone interested?
