<H1><A HREF="index.html">Replicators</A>: B36/S245</H1>

Soon after the discovery of a replicator in
<A HREF="b36s23.html">HighLife</A>,
Mark Niemiec found another rule with a replicator: B36/S245.
The initial pattern consists of a pair of "shuttles".

<P>Frankly, I don't understand this replicator's behavior very well.  It
does not follow the typical parity-rule replicator pattern.  Instead,
each shuttle above, if sufficiently far from everything else, repeats
its shape in 102 generations, flipped 180 degrees, after laying a pair
of "eggs" (period 4 oscillators).  But, if an egg is already present, it
produces a collection of sparks, which in the presence of the
symmetrically placed shuttle end up hatching another replicator after 96
generations.
So, the first few generations at which a copy of the replicator
reappears are 102, 204, 300 (the first hatched egg), 306, 402, 504, 606,
702, and 708.  There is no replicator e.g. at generation 408 because the
replicator that should form then crashes with another formed by the
generation-306 replicator.  Somehow, despite all this asynchrony,
the replication of shuttles and eggs always continues
with the usual sawtooth growth pattern
instead of degenerating into chaos.

<P>Rule B36/S245 is also interesting because, like Life, it has
<A HREF="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b36s245/">many small spaceships</A>,
including a 3x3 period-7 diagonal glider,
and a 4c/23 spaceship I found based on a combination of a form of the shuttle
with two p4 oscillators.

<P>As Niemiec discovered, replicator-based oscillators can be used to form
a glider gun.

Dean Hickerson later discovered a simpler way of capping
rows of replicator by period-4 oscillators.  As with the parity-rule
replicators, this can be used to make arbitrarily high period oscillators.
Hickerson also found an alternate (double-barreled) gun mechanism
for replicators capped by p6 oscillators.

<P>Later, Hickerson, investigating other ways of combining pairs of
shuttles to make replicators, found that they could instead be used to
make puffers, moving 28 steps every 600 or 1200 generations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

HEIGHT=71 ALT="B36/S245 28c/1200 puffer"></A></DIV></P>

<P>Finally, these puffers can be tamed, to produce spaceships which move at
speed 14c/300

<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="b36s245-14c300.lif"><IMG
SRC="b36s245-14c300.gif" WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=71 ALT="B36/S245 14c/300 spaceship"></A></DIV></P>

<P>and 28c/1200

<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="b36s245-28c1200.lif"><IMG
SRC="b36s245-28c1200.gif" WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=165 ALT="B36/S245 28c/1200 spaceship"></A></DIV></P>

Probably the next interesting but still-unknown pattern to look for in
this rule would be some kind of breeder.
Other interesting patterns to look for include guns or glider syntheses
of the 4c/23 or 14c/300 spaceships.
