Title: 
On Unique Independence Weighted Graphs
</h2>

<p>
Abstract: 
We first give our
motivation for studying this problem by a short description on
Combinatorial Auctions, and then focus on those vertex-weighted
graphs
whose maximum independent set is unique. We provide some theorems on
this
topic and then conclude the talk with the complexity of the problem.
