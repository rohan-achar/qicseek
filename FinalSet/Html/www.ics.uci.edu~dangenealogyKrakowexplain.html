</center>

These charts (also known as Pedigree charts)
list a person's ancestors in graphic branching form.<P>

Each person has a listing showing that person's name and vital dates.
In addition, there are vertical lines connecting
a child to known parents.
The person's father is listed above
(and the mother is listed below)
the person's listing.

</center>

<center>
Ahnentafel is a German word--<EM>Ahnen</EM> meaning ancestors,
and <EM>tafel</EM> meaning chart.
</center><p>

These charts list a person's ancestors in lineal form, rather than in
graphic branching form as in Pedigree charts.
Except for the first person (#1), all males are even-numbered,
while all females are odd-numbered.<p>

The father of any person is double that person's number.
The mother of any person is one more than double that person's number.
So, the father of person #1 is numbered #2,
and the mother of person #1 is numbered #3.
This same formula continues on through all ascending generations.<p>

To determine the relationship of an ancestor to person #1,
or to determine the descending lineage from any ancestor,
the formula is in reverse.
Simply divide the ahnentafel number by 2 for a male,
and subtract 1 and divide by 2 for a female.<p>

If you want to determine the descendancy of the person whose
ahnentafel number is 85, subtract one
(since this person is odd-numbered we know it is a female)
and divide 84 by 2 to equal 42.
So #85 is the mother of #42;
#42 is the father of #21.
Again, an odd number, which tells us that #21 is the mother of #10,
who is the father of #5, who is the mother of #2,
who is the father of #1.<p>
