<p>Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first).</p>

    <td>Su 5/27</td>
    <td>I added a clarification to Part 2 of <a href="LabManual/Assignment4">Assignment #4</a>.  You will not be permitted to write a single message containing a <b>repeated</b> field with all of the exercises; instead, I want you to confront the issue of writing a stream of multiple messages and figuring out, on your own, what the type of each message is.  The goal is to understand what Protocol Buffers does and does not do for you automatically.</td>

    <td>Yesterday's <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a> of implementing the MapReduce algorithm in Erlang is now available.  Note, too, that Part 3 of <a href="LabManual/Assignment3">Assignment #3</a> has been updated to reflect the new version of that code example we wrote this quarter; fundamentally, the problem hasn't changed, but a few of the requirements have been changed to be more in line with the way we solved the problem in lecture this quarter.</td>

        <li>Today's <a href="CodeExamples">code examples</a> are up.</li>
        <li><a href="LabManual/Assignment3">Assignment #3</a> is available.  Note that Part 3 of the assignment makes reference to a code example that we've not yet covered and is not yet available on the web site, but we've certainly covered enough to allow you to work through the first two parts.</li>
