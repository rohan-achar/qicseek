<H2>Switching Webs</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
You can switch between different hyperwebs in order to construct different 
contexts.  In this example you will switch from bill_web to flight_web and
make some anchors and links in it.
</p>

<H3>Switching from bill_web to flight_web</H3>

<p> Go to the Webs tab on the Chimera Server and logout of bill_web.
Then select the flight_web by clicking on it.  
</p>

<H3>Switching webs changes Anchors and Links</H3>

<p>  When you shift from one web to another, the anchors 
and links on one web are different from the other.  The bill.gif
will not have an anchor on it any longer since an anchor has not
been defined on it in flight_web.  The images below show how bill.gif
is displayed by Jimage.  The image on the left is when the bill_web has
been selected in the Chimera Server, the image on the right is 
when the flight_web has been selected.
</p>

<LEFT><IMG SRC="images/bill_anchored.gif" WIDTH="96"
HEIGHT="116"></LEFT>

<RIGHT><IMG SRC="images/bill.gif" WIDTH="88"
HEIGHT="84"></RIGHT>

<p> Each web has its own set of anchors and links.</p>

<p> You are now ready to make new anchors and links in flight_web.
