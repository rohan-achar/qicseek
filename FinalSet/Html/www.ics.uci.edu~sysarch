<p>
The Parallel Architectures and Systems group in the Department of Computer Science at UCI conducts research
on processor architecture and software for parallel, high-performance and distributed systems (including 
embedded systems).  The best way to learn about our work is to look at our projects and publications.

<dir>
"WebRTC is perhaps the most disruptive of all HTML5 APIs. By making the audio and video communications programmable in the browser language, it is expected to have a profound impact on the way we communicate with each other. WebRTC will enable exciting new experiences on computing devices in individual communications, group meetings, e-commerce, customer support, remote collaborations, media, and online education among others.  WebRTC has the potential of transforming the web to the main real-time interaction medium.
<br>
<br>
Kudos to the UC Irvine research team of Prof. Nicolau and Prof. Veidenbaum for developing WebRTCBench, a ground breaking benchmarking suite for quantitative measurement of the system characteristics of fundamental operations of WebRTC. With the rapidly increasing importance of WebRTC in computing and communication industries, I have growing hope that WebRTCBench will play a major role in helping optimize WebRTC implementations and shape this exceptionally important emerging technology."
