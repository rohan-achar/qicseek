This paper describes our work on developing technology
for rapidly assembling information portals that provide
integrated access to and analysis of information from multiple
sources in the case of any disaster. Many recent disasters (the
S.E. Asian Tsunamis, the London subway bombings, the Katrina
hurricane, to name a few) have demonstrated that a lot of
valuable information becomes available in the hours and days
immediately following the disaster, and such information is indeed
valuable to disaster managers or even citizens in their response.
In this paper we describe our work on developing information
portals for disasters in general; we describe many key information
processing capabilities and challenges that we consider
important in such portals and also describe our approach to
developing such capabilities.
