Please also check   your recorded scores... I've sent email with the details.</p><p>[November 25, 2002] I've granted an extension to the due date on the implemenation   assignment, but at the penalty of reducing the maximum possible score for that   assignment from 7 to 5. Details are in the email sent to the course mailing   list. There will NOT be an extension granted for the testing assignment. </p><p>[October 3, 2002] You can find some very helpful guidelines for the composition   of good email messages <a href="http://www.compositioncafe.com/21492/email.html">here</a>,   courtesy of Ellen Strenski in the UCI writing program.</p><p>[September 29, 2002] Would you like to add this class? So would about 110 other   people (literally). The room capacity is 190. Currently there are 175 people   enrolled. I will therefore sign in a total of 15 people. <strong>Priority will   be given as follows</strong>: (A) ICS majors who are seniors; (B) non-ICS majors   who are both seniors and ICS minors; (C) ICS majors who are juniors. Before   I sign an add card you must complete, sign, and return to me <a href="ICS52Add.pdf">this   form</a> no later than Wednesday, October 2nd. Give me the form, a filled in   add card, and I will process the submissions. Signed add cards will be available   Friday, October 4th, from my office (in the bin on the outside of my door).</p><HR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="#overview">Overview</A> |<A HREF="#textbooks">Textbooks</A> |<A HREF="#schedule">Schedule</A> |<A HREF="#assignments">Assignments</A> |<A HREF="#TAs">TAs</A> |<A HREF="#touch">Keeping in Touch</A> |<A HREF="#computing">Computing</A> |<A HREF="#Disabilities">Disabilities</a> | <a HREF="#cheating"> Academic Dishonesty</A> |<BR></center><hr><h1> Instructor</h1><ul>  <LI> Professor <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/"> Richard N.
