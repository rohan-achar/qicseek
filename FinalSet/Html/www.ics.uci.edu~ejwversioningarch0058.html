&gt; So, before I can read what you wrote, I have to translate:
&gt;
&gt; # 1. Retrieval of a stated version of a resource: Any given revision of
&gt; # a resource should (?) be accessible... etc.
&gt;
&gt; Now that I read it, I don't really go along with your requirements;
&gt; I'd like to see something like:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   IF a server is providing access to a sytem with underlying version
&gt;   management capability
&gt;
&gt;   THEN the accessible versions of a resource should be named with
&gt;     URLs of the following style.

Larry, I think that for casual (or even not so casual) discussion
on the list, we can assume that we are discussing a "server
[that] is providing access to a system with underlying version
management capability."  Of course, your text is clearly more
appropriate for the RFC.

&gt; You might want to add warning messages or errors, e.g., VERSION NOT
&gt; AVAILABLE, but provide a (stylized?) link to the latest(?) version,
&gt; also to provide some mechanism for querying available versions, etc.

This is the sort of stuff that could (would?) go into the entity
returned with the status code.
