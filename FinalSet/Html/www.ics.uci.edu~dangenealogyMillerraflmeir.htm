	, of Dlha Luka, Slovakia.
	They had 6 children. Simon lived in Bardejov for some period but came to the US several times, beginning in the 1880's
	(probably to check it out). In 1893 Simon and his  family (except for Meyer) came to the United States (New York).
	He most likely departed from Bardejov  (Bardfeld), Slovakia. Meyer had problems with his eyes and came via Hamburg
	around 1900 (his son Royal remembers Meyer saying he was 13 years old when he arrived). Simon moved, upon his arrival, 
	to Torrington, Connecticut, where he peddled lye. His business partner shot him and left  him for dead. He survived
	but had (some)  paralysis on his left side (leg). He and all his children, with the exception of David, moved back to
	New York in 1903. Simon passed away, from chronic nephritis, at the age of 60. This was just a couple of weeks after
	his brother, <A HREF="#L1.2.1.1">Avrohm Aba</A>, passed away. Simon's final resting place is at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Ridgewood, NY.
	He was survived by 4 sons,  2 daughters, and 19 grandchildren.
