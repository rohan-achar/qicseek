Title: Orderly Spanning Trees with Applications to Graph Encoding and Graph Drawing

<br>
Speaker: Gwendoline Chien</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
This paper introduces the orderly pair of connected planar graphs. We
give a linear-time algorithm to obtain an orderly pair (H,T) of G, where H
is a planar embedding of G, and T is an orderly spanning Tree of H.  As
applications, we show that the technique of orderly spanning trees yields
(i) the best known encoding of G with query support, and (ii) the first
area-optimal 2-visibility drawing of G.

This paper, by Yi-Ting Chiang, Ching-Chi Lin, and Hsueh-I Lu,
was presented at the 2001 Symposium on Discrete Algorithms.
