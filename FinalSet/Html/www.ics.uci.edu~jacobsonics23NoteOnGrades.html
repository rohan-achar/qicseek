Next are the scores for yourlabs and their total, weighted by the fraction of the total lab grade eachlab was worth. Note that scores above 4 count as a kind of extra credit &#151;4 points is considered 100% of the possible points for a lab. Then come two columns that help in calculating your adjusted lab score, followed by that adjusted score. For details on how this is computed, see the Course Reference; if you are curious how your grader ranked, see the TA chart off to the right of main grade sheet. <p>Next is your midterm and final exam scores.  Then appears thecourse total; it was computed out of 100 points, weighted to the valueswe published in the Course Reference.<p>Your letter grade appears next; if you are taking the class P/NP, the Registrar will change your grade to P or NP as appropriate. Sometimes, instead of a grade, you'll see the notation "NR"--Grade Not Recorded--becausethere are pending issues that must be resolved before a grade can be given;if you see an "NR" grade for yourself and have not yet contacted me, do so!<p>Do check over your scores; if you find any which are incorrect because of a clerical or procedural error and <i>thatwould change your final grade</i>, contact me by email (my scheduleduring sumemer tends to be erratic). Note the only reasons for which I can change a grade are if a procedural or clerical error occurred#151;UCI rules.<p>The posted spreadsheet also shows some statistics on the course andcoursework that might interest you; these stats are at the bottom of the main speadsheet and also to the right of the main sheet.<p>I will hold onto your midterm and final exam Scantron sheets into the firstcouple of weeks of next quarter, in case you have questions.<p>My best wishes an enjoyable break!<p>Norm</body></html>
