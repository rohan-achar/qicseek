                <h3>Directory user-level/ : use level library for using the PAAPI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>paapi_dvs.h - data structures and functions visible to the end user</li>
                    <li>paapi_dvs.c - contains all functions that interface with the PAAPI system
                    calls as well as control the creation the destruction of POSIX threads. The
                    functions are described as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_create_thread_type: creates a thread type. It takes in as 
                                parameter the thread type info (wcet, deadline, period) and it returns
                                a handle identifying the type</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_change_thread_type: changes the thread type of the calling thread</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_create_instance: creates a thread instance given the type, the
                                code to be executed and the data to pass to the thread and returns a 
                                handle identifying the instance. This functions creates a POSIX thread
                                under the SCHED_FIFO linux real time scheduling policy and stores the 
                                handles for the posix thread internally in the library in the vector
                                "threads". The threads start executing but get block when they call 
                                paapi_dvs_app_associate.</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_init: start the PAAPI library. It only sets the scheduling policy
                                of the calling thread and all its children to SCHED_FIFO</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_select_policy: chooses which PAAPI scheduling policy will be used</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_start_taskset: Starts all the threads created with 
                                paapi_dvs_create_instance. Here the schedulability analysis takes place
                                (within the kernel) and the PAAPI tasks are waken up.</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_app_start: Called by the PAAPI threads. It notifies the beginning
                                of execution (this functions is actually unnecessary but I kept it there
                                anyways. If you look at the code you will see that it does not do anything)</li> 
                            <li>paapi_dvs_app_start_period: Called by the PAAPI threads. It tells the 
                                PAAPI scheduler that the task will start executing its periodic jobs.</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_app_done: it notifies the PAAPI scheduler that the execution 
                                of the job is finished.</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_app_associate: Called by the PAAPI threads. Associated the thread
                                as a PAAPI thread. Before calling this function the thread is technically 
                                not a PAAPI thread yet.</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_app_leave: Called by the PAAPI threads. Leaves the PAAPI scheduler
                                freeing all the resources allocated to it.</li>
                            <li>paapi_dvs_app_sleep_until_next_period: called by the PAAPI threads. Puts
                                the thread to sleep until its next period is due.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directory kernel-level/ : use level library for using the PAAPI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>include/linux/paapi-user.h - defines data structures and constants visible
                        to the user level libraries</li>
                    <li>include/linux/paapi_syscall.h - proper definition of the PAAPI system calls
                        added to the kernel (nothing very interesting)</li>
                    <li>include/linux/paapi_sched.h - data structure and constants used at
                        kernel level only</li>
                    <li>include/paapi.h - interface of the new system calls to user level</li>
                    <li>paapi_sched.c - contains the kernel internal data structures (type and
                        instance tables) as well as functions to help on debugging and trace 
                        collection. This file initially has a lot more code but it was cut down
                        to a few functions and data structures only
                        <ul>
                            <li>log_trace - we don't print out trace message during the execution of tasks
                                because the overhead is prohibitive. So we store a trace of events in a 
                                kernel internal table and print it out at the end of the execution of the
                                task set.</li>
                            <li>print_trace - print the trace messages mentioned above.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>paapi.c - contains the implementation of all the PAAPI system calls defined  
                        at kernel level as well as the queues used to manipulate the PAAPI
                        threads. There are two internal queues:
                        <ul>
                            <li>wait_for_admission_control - the PAAPI threads are put in this queue
                                after calling sys_paapi_associate.</li>
                            <li>wait_for_next_period - the PAAPI threads are put in this queue after
                                calling sys_paapi_sleep_until_next_period</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sys_paapi_create_type - creates a system type and insert in the system 
                                type table</li>
                            <li>sys_paapi_create_instance - creates a new instance and inserts it in the
                                instance table</li>
                            <li>sys_paapi_app_status - depends on the parameter "status" as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>PAAPI_DVS_APP_START - does not do anything anymore.</li>
                                    <li>PAAPI_DVS_APP_START_PERIOD - initializes some data structures in the
                                        instance table and puts the thread to sleep in the
                                        "wait_for_next_period" queue.</li>
                                    <li>PAAPI_DVS_APP_DONE - updates the instance table for the calling thread
                                        marking that the thread is done.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>sys_paapi_associate - marks the flag in the linux process data structure 
                                saying that the calling thread is a PAAPI thread.</li>
                            <li>sys_paapi_sleep_until_next_period - puts the calling thread to sleep in
                                the "wait_for_next_period" queue.</li>
                            <li>sys_paapi_control_taskset - implement three distinct functions depending 
                                on the parameter "cmd":
                                <ul>
                                    <li>PAAPI_CTRL_START_TASKSET - goes over the "wait_for_admission_control"
                                        queue and collects information about each thread (from the type tables)
                                        in order to perform the schedulability analysis and wake up the tasks</li>
                                    <li>PAAPI_CTRL_CHANGE_TYPE - changes the type information of the calling
                                        thread and performs a new schedulability test</li>
                                    <li>PAAPI_PRINT_LOG - print the trace log in the screen. It is called 
                                        by the paapi_dvs_start_taskset user level function after all PAAPI
                                        threads join the parent thread.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>sys_paapi_destroy_task - deallocates info from the instance and type 
                                tables if necessary</li>
                            <li>wake_up_tasks - called by the operating system tick handler in order to 
                                wake up tasks which are due to execution (according to their period).</li>
                            <li>rm_schedulability_analysis - performs the schedulability analysis and 
                                sets the processor speed accordingly. The three parameters are essential
                                in this functions and change its behavior as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>max_iterations - defines for how many iterations the schedulability
                                        analysis algorithm runs. 1 iteration means that a single slowdown
                                        factor for the entires taskset will be computed. With more iterations 
                                        it tries to compute individual slowdown factors per task.</li>
                                    <li>calc_dynamic_factor - when there this is a computation of dynamic 
                                        slowdown factors or static slowdown factors. For the static factors
                                        the WCET of each task is used. For the dynamic factor the average 
                                        execution time in the last HISTORY_WINDOW_SIZE is used.</li>
                                    <li>change_frequency - whether the processor frequency should be changed
                                        after computing the slowdown factors.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>update_next_task.incl - macro inserted within the Linux scheduler to keep
                        track of execution information of a PAAPI job whenever a context switch
                        takes place. This macro updates the info of the task selected for
                        execution.</li>
                    <li>update_current_task.incl - This macro updates the info of the job preempted
                        of completed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Linux kernel files modified (relative to the Linux directory three):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>power - softlink inserted in the tree and pointing to the directory 
                        "kernel-level"</li>
                    <li>include/linux/power - softlink inserted in the tree and pointing to the

                        are inserted right before a context switch takes place. Two includes are 
                        also inserted "#include &lt;linux/cpufreq.h&gt;" and 
                        "#include &lt;linux/power/paapi_sched.h&gt;".</li>
                    <li>include/linux/sched.h - two new fields are added to the "struct task_struct"
                        data structure: instance_index and paapi_task. The first is a pointer to
                        the PAAPI instance table representing this task and the second is a flag
                        used to recognize whether this thread is a PAAPI thread.</li>
                    <li>include/asm-arm/arch-sa1100/time.h - function call to wake_up_tasks is 
                        inserted in the OS tick interrupt handler "sa1100_timer_interrupt" in order
                        to wake up tasks when their period is due.</li>
                    <li>arch/arm/config.in - this line
                        "int 'Timer frequency (HZ) (100)' CONFIG_HZ 100" is inserted to allow
                        configuration of the OS timer tick precision.
                    <li>fs/proc/array.c - the following was added in the file:
                        <pre>
        /* start: modified for PAAPI implementation */
        priority,
        nice,
        0UL /* removed */,
        //task->it_real_value,
        hz_to_std(task->it_real_value),
        hz_to_std(task->start_time),
        vsize,
        mm ? mm->rss : 0, /* you might want to shift this left 3 */
        /* end: modified for PAAPI implementation */
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>include/asm-arm/param.h the following was modified in the file. The lines
                        commented out were there originally. The rest was added.
                        <pre>

        //#ifndef HZ
        //#define HZ 100
        #ifdef __KERNEL__

        # define USER_HZ       100             /* some user interfaces are in ticks */
        # define CLOCKS_PER_SEC        (USER_HZ)       /* like times() */
        # define hz_to_std(x) ((x) / ((HZ) / (USER_HZ)))
        #endif
        //#if defined(__KERNEL__) && (HZ == 100)
        //#define hz_to_std(a) (a)
        #ifndef HZ
        #define HZ 100                  /* if userspace cheats, give them 100 */
        #endif
        /* end: modified for PAAPI implementation */
                        </pre>
                    </li>
