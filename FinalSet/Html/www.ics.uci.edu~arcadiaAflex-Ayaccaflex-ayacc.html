<H1>Aflex and Ayacc</H1>

Aflex and ayacc are similar to the Unix tools lex and
yacc, but they are written in Ada and generate Ada output.  They were
developed by the Arcadia Project at the University of California,
Irvine.  Aflex is based on the tool 'flex' written by Vern Paxson.
These tools are copyrighted, but are freely redistributable.  There is
no warranty of any kind (see the copyright notice.)  However we
do ask that you report any problems you encounter as we use these
tools ourselves and we want to fix any bugs that are found.

<P>

You may give this software to others, but we prefer that those who can
get it directly from us to insure that all users are running the
latest version.  We also ask that you send electronic mail to the
address irus-software-request@ics.uci.edu giving your name, your
organization, a paper mail address, and your e-mail address (either an
Internet address or a UUCP path relative to a well-known site such as
uunet.)  A form is provided below for your convenience.  We will use
this information to set up a mailing list to announce new versions of
aflex and ayacc, as well as new software that is expected to be made
available.

<P>


<H2> Availability </H2>
Aflex and Ayacc are copy-righted by the University of California, but 
source code is available free of charge via anonymous
