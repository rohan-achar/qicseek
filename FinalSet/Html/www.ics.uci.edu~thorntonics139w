Also available today is the <a href="WritingAssignments/InfluencingPolicy">Influencing Policy</a> assignment, the first draft of which is due on Wednesday, April 27.

    <td>Our TA, Chris Jensen, has put up his own <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cjensen/teaching/139/s_05.html">139W site</a> that you will likely find useful.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>M 4/18</td>
    <td>We have been moved to a new classroom!  Fortunately, it's a "technology enhanced classroom," which will help us greatly with our oral presentations later in the quarter, and probably other points along the way.  We will begin meeting in PSCB 120 on Wednesday, April 20.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>W 4/13</td>
    <td>There has been some question about how to submit the final version of your <a href="WritingAssignments/WritingInstructions">Writing Instructions</a> paper.  Final versions of all assignments are to be submitted only electronically, using the <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">Checkmate</a> system.  You'll need to register yourself for the course before you can submit.  Note that there are two ICS 139W courses this quarter, so we had to come up with unique names for them: Jim Arvo's course is listed in Checkmate as "I&C SCI 139Wa" and ours is listed as "I&C SCI 139Wb."  Please be sure that you register for the right one.</td>

  <tr>

    <td>The first two <a href="WritingAssignments">writing assignments</a> are now available.  Be sure to have a look at the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a> for a list of due dates, as these two assignments overlap one another.
