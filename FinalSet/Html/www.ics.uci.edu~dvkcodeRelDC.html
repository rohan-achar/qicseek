<H4>Introduction</H4>
</center>

<p align =justify >
<b>RelDC</b> is an Entity Resolution algorithm that leverages <b>relationships</b> for disambiguation. The traditional approach for entity resolution uses "features" associated with a reference/record/object to find references that co-refer, that is, refer to the same object. For some domains using features only could be sufficient to get high quality. For others, using "features" only are not enough and much higher disambiguation quality could be achieved by using additional sources of information.<BR> 
<BR>
In our larger <A href="http://sherlock.ics.uci.edu">Project SHERLOCK @ UCI</A> we have studied which other sources and types of information could be used, in addition to just features, to better disambiguate among references. This information could be present in the dataset being cleaned itself (e.g., deeper context, long chains of inter-object relationships) or can be obtained from external data sources, including ontologies, encyclopedias, and the Web.<BR>
<BR>
As part of Project SHERLOCK @ UCI, we have pioneered a novel entity resolution methodology called Relationship-Based Data Cleaning (<b>RelDC</b>). RelDC relies upon the observation that many real-world datasets are <EM>relational</EM> in nature
and contain not only information about entities (and their "features") but also relationships among them, knowledge of which can be used to disambiguate among representations more effectively. RelDC is a principled, domain-independent framework that
exploits the <EM>entity-relationship graph</EM> of the dataset, and specifically
relationships, for high-quality entity resolution that is self-tuning and requires minimal
intervention by analysts.<BR>
<BR>
The source code below is what we internally call <b>"RelDC Engine"</b>. It is a bare bones implementation of the iterative and most basic version of RelDC.
The main purposes of the code were:
<ul>
<li>It has allowed us to build more advanced algorithms on top of it, by extending the RelDC Engine code.</li>

<li>To show that using relationships only (the code largely ignores "features", except for blocking) can result in a major quality improvement for certain domains.</li>

<li>To show that a very efficient implementation of RelDC is possible. This is since the RelDC algorithm contains a part that is difficult to scale: discovering all paths between many pairs of nodes in a large entity-relationship graph. One of the key values of RelDC Engine code is that it contains algorithms that solve this problem efficiently for you. That is why we have used it as an "engine" to drive our other approaches.</li>
</ul>

Hence, RelDC Engine code can be very useful to those who want to build other entity-resolution techniques that leverage relationships.
