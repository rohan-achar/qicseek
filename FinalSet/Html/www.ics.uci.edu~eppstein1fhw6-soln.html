<P><LI>Suppose you have offices in five cities, Anchorage, Portland,
Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, that you wish to connect up by
a communications network.  The costs to connect each pair of cities are

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0>

<P>(a) What is the minimum cost of a communications network connecting all
your offices?  (I.e., what is the minimum spanning tree.)
Draw this network.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: the minimum-cost network uses links connecting
Portland-Seattle, SF-Seattle, LA-Seattle, and Anchorage-Portland.
Its cost is
$300&nbsp;+&nbsp;$500&nbsp;+&nbsp;$700&nbsp;+&nbsp;$1200&nbsp;=&nbsp;$2700.

<P>(b) Some types of network require the offices to be connected into a
single loop (so the cheapest network is the same as the solution to the
traveling salesman problem).
Does there exist an algorithm for solving this problem?
Draw the best such network you can find.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: yes, there exists an algorithm, for instance brute force search
(trying all possible loops), but it is not efficient. 
In this case there are 24 different loops
(the general formula is that n cities would have (n-1)! loops).

<P>I believe the shortest loop is Anchorage - Los Angeles - Seattle -
Portland - San Francisco - Anchorage, with total cost $4300. 

<P>One way to see that this is best involves splitting the loop into
the part going into and out of Anchorage, and the remaining four-city path.
Los Angeles - Seattle - Portland - San Francisco is the shortest
four-city path not involving Anchorage, so any better loop would have to
improve on the part of the tour going into and out of Anchorage.
But there are only two combinations of cities (San Francisco and
Portland, or Los Angeles and Portland) for which the cost into and out
of Anchorage is better, and neither combination gives a better overall loop.

<P><LI>For each of the following functions,
state whether or not a program having the function as its running time
would be a polynomial-time program.

<P>(a) time(n) = 4n<sup>3</sup> + 3n + 3
<BR>(b) time(n) = 2n log n + 30n
<BR>(c) time(n) = n<sup>1.5</sup>
<BR>(d) time(n) = 2<sup>n</sup> log n

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: Yes for a, b, and c; no for d.
</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>For each of the following functions of a single parameter n,
simplify it as much as possible using O-notation.
For instance, if the function
is 4n<sup>3</sup> + 3n + 3,
you should simplify it to O(n<sup>3</sup>).

<P>(a) n + n<sup>2</sup>
<BR>(b) 2<sup>n</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 2/n
<BR>(c) (n+1)/(n-1)
<BR>(d) 2<sup>n</sup> + 3<sup>n</sup> + 4<sup>n</sup> + 5<sup>n</sup>
<BR>(e) n<sup>2</sup> + 100n + 10000


<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer:<BR>
(a) O(n<sup>2</sup>)<BR>
(b) O(2<sup>n</sup>)<BR>
(c) O(1)<BR>
(d) O(5<sup>n</sup>)<BR>
(e) O(n<sup>2</sup>)
