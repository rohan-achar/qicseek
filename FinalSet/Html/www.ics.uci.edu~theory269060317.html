<h1>Tight Approximation Algorithms for 
Maximum General Assignment Problems</h1>

Abstract:
<p>
The authors show that for any separable assignment problem (SAP), if there 
exists an B-approximation algorithm for solving the single bin case, then 
there is an LP-based algorithm that yields an (1-1/e - 
&epsilon;)-approximation and a local search algorithm with a 
(1/2-&epsilon;)-approximation.

A SAP is defined as follows:  Given a set of bins and items to pack into 
bins, a value <I>f_ij</I> for assigning item <I>j</I> to bin <I>i</I>, and a separate packing 
constraint on each bin (defined by a set of subsets of items that fit into 
bin <I>i</I>), find the packing that maximizes the aggregate value.
