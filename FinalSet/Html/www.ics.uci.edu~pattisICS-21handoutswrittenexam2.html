<h1>Outline for ICS-21 Written Final Exam</h1>
<p>
</center>
<hr align="left" width="100%">
<p>

I have collected together in this one handout the list of topics that we have
  covered in the second half of ICS-21.
This list is quite extensive (not as long as for the first half of the course,
  but the topics are a bit more subtle and have many connections with each
  other and the material that we studied earlier), and there is no way that I
  can ask questions covering all of it; likewise, there is no way that you can
  learn all this material starting now (I'm assuming that you've been learning
  it during the entire quarter).
<p>
Therefore, you should concentrate on reviewing the most important analysis and
  synthesis skills that we have studied.
Use the quizzes (and to a lesser extent the programming assignments and daily
  homework assignments) as a guide for what material is of primary importance.
Understand the material on its own terms, and how to use this material when
  writing code.
<p>
My written exams are not designed to determine if you understand obscure
   material; instead, they are designed to determine if you understand
  important material, and can use your knowledge to understand and answer
  questions <b>quickly</b>.
My exams are long (some students will not finish them): it you don't
  immediately know the answer to a question, skip it, and come back to it
  later, if you have time (sometimes working problems later in the exam will
  remind you of something relevant to the answer to earlier questions).
<p>
<b>Important:</b>Recall  that the final exam can also cover topics from the
   first half of the course.
   I would suggest reviewing the the earlier quizzes and midterm exam.
   Fundamentally, the second "half" of the quarter dealt with writing classes,
     using arrays, and using interfaces.
   Here is a <a href="writtenexam1.html">Topics from the first half
     of the class</a> link.
