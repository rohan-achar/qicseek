<h2>ICS 260 - Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- Fall, 2002 (Eppstein)</h2>

<p><b>Instructor:</b> David Eppstein, CS 358D, 949-824-6384, <a
href="mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a>.<br>
Office hours by appointment; call or send email to set up a time. I
will usually be available immediately after class.</p>

<p><b>Class meeting:</b> <a href= 
"http://www.reg.uci.edu/cgi-bin/options.py?script=soc_course.py&amp;course_code=36589&amp;year=01&amp;term=2">
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:30 - 1:50PM, in IERF B015.</a></p>

<p><b>Adds, drops, etc.:</b> There are plenty of seats in the
classroom, so I will be happy to add you to the class DURING THE
FIRST WEEK. You may drop the course any time up through the sixth
week of classes.</p>

<p><b>Course Text:</b> There is no required text. Some of the
material will be taken from the following books:</p>

<ul>
<li>[AMO] Ahuja, Magnanti and Orlin. <em> Network Flows</em>,
Prentice Hall, 1993.</li>

<li>[CLRS] Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. <em> Introduction to
Algorithms</em>.  See also the <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-2e-bugs.html">online errata</a>.</li>

<li>[GJ] Garey and Johnson, <em>Computers and Intractability: A
Guide to the Theory of NP-completeness</em>, W. H. Freeman and
Company 1979.</li>

<li>[P] Papadimitriou, <em>Computational Complexity</em> ,
Addison-Wesley, 1994.</li>
</ul>

In addition, <a href="notes/">course notes are available
online</a>. Please be aware that the notes are from a previous
offering of 260, and although they cover roughly the same material
as I expect to, they do not necessarily have the same emphasis. You
are responsible for all material covered in the lecture, even if it
is not covered in the course notes. 

<p><b>Coursework and grading:</b> Due to the lack of teaching
assistance for this course, there will be no required homeworks.
However, you may find it helpful to study <a href= 
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dillenco/ics260/homework.html">Prof.
Dillencourt's homeworks</a> from last Winter. The graded
courseworks will consist of two midterms (each worth 30% of the
grade) and a comprehensive final exam (worth 40%). Note: I reserve
the right to assign a failing grade to a student who performs
extremely poorly on the final exam, irrespective of his/her
performance on the midterms. Similarly, I reserve the right to
assign a student who performs extremely well on the final exam a
higher grade than his/her course average would dictate. Exams are
closed-book, and sharing or copying answers is not allowed;
violating this honesty policy will result in failing the class.</p>
