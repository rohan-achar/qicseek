<H2>1. Introduction </H2>

<H3>1.1 Purpose </H3>

<P>The purpose of this document is to extend the HTTP 1.1 [HTTP11] protocol
to support features which satisfy the Distributed Authoring and Versioning
requirements set down in [INSERT REFERENCE TO UNIFIED DAV REQUIREMENTS
DRAFT].</P>

<DT><B>command comments</B> </DT>

<DD>Command Comments associate either a string or a URI with an HTTP message.
See section x.x.</DD>

<DT><B>copy</B> </DT>

<DD>A copy performs a duplication of a resource, making it available at
both the original and new location in the URI namespace. Due to contextual
differences, it may not be possible to create an exact copy of a resource.
A copy only requires best effort on the part of the copy agent. See section
x.x.</DD>

<DD>A group of URIs which are manipulated as a unit. See section x.x.</DD>

<DT><B>destroy</B> </DT>

<DD>To destroy a resource is to request that the resource be permanently
removed from storage. This differs from delete in that some versioning
systems handle delete as a request to no longer make the specified resource
available under the specified URI. See section x.x.</DD>

<DT><B>diff</B> </DT>

<DD>A diff is a mechanism whereby two or more resources are compared and
the differences enumerated. See section x.x.</DD>

</DL>

<H3>1.3 Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar </H3>

<P>This specification uses the Augmented BNF and Basic Rules as defined
in Section 2 of [HTTP11]. </P>

<H3>1.4 Design Conventions</H3>

<P>The following design conventions have been adopted by the HTTP Distributed
Authoring and Versioning (DAV) group.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Whenever reasonable new functionality will be expressed as new methods.
When sensible the commands for such a method will be included in the message
body of the request.</LI>

<LI>This resolution was adopted in order to solve a debate about how to
express new functions such as copy and diff. One group wished to use POST
and MIME types to express new commands. Another group wished to use new
methods and MIME types to express new commands. A third group wished to
use new methods and new method headers to express new commands. The group
settled on using new methods and MIME types to express new commands. The
new methods would allow for quick parsing by proxies and servers but the
MIME types would allow for flexibility in specifying the command. It was
also felt that introducing method specific headers would violate the letter
and spirit of the HTTP protocol.</LI>

<LI>Methods should only perform a single action.</LI>

<LI>The original design of many of the methods in this document allowed
for multiple requests of the same type to be packaged together. So, for
example, one could send a Copy method which specified that 1000 different
URIs should be copied. It was decided that in the face of pipelining, compressed
headers, and other innovations there was no need to add this level of complexity
to the protocol. This decision was based upon the assumption that a new
method or MIME type would be introduced which would allow for any number
of HTTP requests to be bundled together. It was further assumed that such
a method or MIME type would carry with it the option to specify that the
contents be processed atomically.</LI>

<LI>URLs are opaque tokens and should be treated as such.</LI>

<LI>It is often possible to decrease the number of trips to retrieve a
particular piece of data by putting suffixes on URLs. However URLs are
intended to be opaque tokens. The above design principal not prevent the
use of suffixes but rather requires that the server indicates that a particular
URL understands a particular type of suffix.</LI>

<LI>Only addressable entities will be subject to the commands in this document.</LI>

<LI>Response must be machine processable. Currently HTTP responses rely
upon humans being available to view the response and take appropriate action.
This level of error encoding is not sufficient for WEBDAV purposes where
all actions and results of all actions must be fully machine processable.
However, a corollary of this design principal is that response messages
are not required to provide information about incorrect syntax, only to
point out that incorrect syntax has been submitted. It is legitimate to
assume that the client and server are both capable of generating proper
syntax. However, this corollary in no way effects the general principal
of being generous in the sorts of messages accepted.</LI>
</OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<LI>It is sometimes desirable to have a non-addressable entity. For example,
an accept header may specify a content-language. The response may contain
a representation in that language but may not contain a content-location
header. In that case the representation of that resource in that language
will not alterable with the commands given in this document.</LI>
</DIR>

<H2>2. Schema Methods</H2>

<P><I>[Ed. Note: Misplaced this section - should follow links. Will correct
later.]</I></P>

<H3>2.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>DAV methods provide diverse abilities, and no current system supports
all of them. As such the client requires a mechanism to determine what
features of a method a server supports. DAV provides such a mechanism controlling
how methods are defined and then providing for a feature discovery mechanism.
DAV also provides for a version number to allow servers to alter method
semantics without breaking older clients.</P>

<H3>2.2 Method Formatting</H3>

<P>Part of the feature discovery mechanism is a regulated format for method
request bodies. This format allows for individual method functions to be
identified and for the server to be able to describe its support for those
functions. Methods that support this format are referred to as Schema Methods.
All Schema Methods MUST use this format. [Author's Note: We will have to
change the name.]</P>

<P>A Schema Method takes the following form:</P>

<P><TT>Request-Body = Schema-Version CRLF *(Schema-Entry CRLF)<BR>
Schema-Version = 1*Digit.1*Digit<BR>
Schema-Entry = AttributeName &quot;:&quot; (Enumerated_List | Comma_List
| Open_Value)<BR>
AttributeName = Token<BR>
Enumerated_List = #Token<BR>
Comma_List = #Token<BR>
Open_Value = Text-No-CRLF<BR>
Text-No-CRLF = ; Text which doesn't contain a CRLF</TT></P>

<P>The method's request body always begins with a Schema-Version that is
followed by a series of Schema-Entries. These entries always consist of
a name followed by a colon followed by either a predefined list of values,
a comma separated list of tokens, or an open value which can contain any
legal text but a CRLF.</P>

<P>The Schema-Version major number describes a set of schema entries and
their defined values for a particular method. The major number MUST increase
if the semantics of a previously defined schema entry is altered or if
the Schema Method format is changed.</P>

<P>The Schema-Version minor number is used for feature negotiation purposes.
As defined below feature negotiation allows the server to list each schema-entry
and indicate if the entry is required, optional, or unsupported. A server
MAY add new schema-entries to a method without changing the minor schema-version
number so long as those entries are optional. If a new required schema-entry
is introduced then the minor number MUST be increased.</P>

<H3>2.3 Schema Entry Negotiation &amp; Response Format</H3>

<P>With the Schema Method format it becomes possible for a server to provide
information to a client regarding the schema-entries it supports and the
manner in which it supports them. This mechanism is completely mechanistic
so any Schema Method can be negotiated upon. This section describes the
response format used by a server to declare the nature of its support for
a Schema Method.</P>

<P>The format is to list each schema entry, mark it as required, optional,
or unsupported, and then indicate what values it may take on. Schema entries
with predefined lists of values the server lists which of those values
is supported. For schema entries with a comma delaminated list of tokens,
the server indicates how many tokens it will accept. No additional information
is provided for schema entries that use the Text-No-CRLF production.</P>

<P>A client MAY include schema entries whose values are enumerated lists
for which there is only a single legal value. A client MUST NOT include
schema entries that have been marked as unsupported. A client MAY include
a schema entry that is marked as optional. A client MUST include schema
entries that are marked as required. A client MUST only use values that
the server has indicated it will accept. If definition of a Schema Method
does not state that a schema entry is required then the server MAY make
that entry required, optional, or unsupported. The Schema-Version production
MUST be included in all request bodies of all Schema Methods. The definition
of a Schema Method MAY put restrictions on the interaction of schema entries,
such as declaring that if one schema-entry is required then so must another.</P>

<P>The format for providing Schema Method negotiation information is a
web collection that is contained in a response of type Text/HTML.</P>

<P><B>WC Attributes:<BR>
<BR>
</B><TT>Type = &quot;DAV/VersionSupport&quot;<BR>
Name = MethodName<BR>
Schema-Version = SupportedVersions<BR>
SupportedVersions = #(VersionRange | MajorNumber | Individual)<BR>
VersionRange = Schema-Version &quot;to&quot; Schema-Version<BR>
MajorNumber = 1*Digit &quot;.&quot; &quot;*&quot;<BR>
Individual = Schema-Version</TT></P>

<P><B>WCDATA Entry:</B></P>

<P><TT>Entry = AttributeName (Required_Optional | &quot;Unsupported&quot;)
CRLF<BR>
AttributeName = Token<BR>
Required_Optional = (&quot;Required&quot; | &quot;Optional&quot;) [(EnumList
| NumLegalEntries)]<BR>
EnumList = &quot;Enumerated_List&quot; &quot;:&quot; &quot;[&quot;#Token&quot;]&quot;
| &quot;AsDefined&quot;<BR>
NumLegalEntries = &quot;Number_Entries&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*Digit | &quot;Infinite&quot;
| &quot;AsDefined&quot; </TT></P>

<P>The &quot;AsDefined&quot; value is used when the definition of possible
values is too complex to be expressed in this simple negotiation format.</P>

<P>The VersionRange production allows the server to declare support for
all versions within a specified range. The MajorNumber production allows
the server to declare support for all versions within a major version.
The Individual version production allows the server to declare support
for an individual version.</P>

<P>Multiple web collections may be specified as necessary if support differs
based on schema-version.</P>

<H3>2.4 Schema Method Support Discovery</H3>

<P>Two mechanisms are provided for discovering server support for a Schema
Method. One is by checking for a link and the other is by using a discovery
method. A server MUST support at least one of these two mechanisms.</P>

<H3>2.4.1 SchemaMethod Link</H3>

<P>The type of the schema method link is defined as follows:</P>

<P>SchemaMethodLink = <TT>&quot;DAV.SchemaMethod.&quot; MethodName<BR>
MethodName = Token</TT></P>

<P>This destination of this link is the support provided by the source
for the method specified. The result will be a text/html response body
containing a series of web collections describing the systems support for
that Schema Method.</P>

<P>[NOT YET DEFINED - A Web Collection to indicate that there is variation
of function based on namespace.]</P>

<H3>2.4.2 SCHEMASUPPORT</H3>

<H3>2.4.2.1 Method Definition</H3>

<H3>2.4.2.2 Request Body</H3>

<H3>2.4.2.3 Response Body</H3>

<H3>2.4.2.4 Error Conditions</H3>

<P>[2.4.2 NOT YET DEFINED - It will provide for the submission of a schema
method name and information about schema versions supported by the client.
The server will then return a web collection specifying the sort of support
provided for the schema method and schema versions indicated.]</P>

<H2>3. Links</H2>

<H3>3.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>In [HTTP11] link and unlink methods were introduced. The idea was to
allow for two or more arbitrary resources to be associated with each other.
In essence, its purpose was to extend the linking facilities available
on the Web to all content types, not just HTML.</P>

<P>This document proposes a link facility consisting of links which are
typed and unidirectional, containing an explicit source and destination.</P>

<H3>3.2 Link Types</H3>

<P>Links are typed. These types explain the purpose and behavior of a link.
It is possible that multiple links defined on the same resource may have
the same type, e.g., a resource with multiple authors.</P>

<P>A link type usually belongs to a link schema, such as the &quot;LockInfo&quot;
type which belongs to the &quot;DAV&quot; schema. By convention, links
which belong to a schema are specified as: schema &quot;.&quot; typename.
Thus, the LockInfo type would be specified as &quot;DAV.LockInfo&quot;.
This creates a type namespace which is less susceptable to namespace collision
than a single, flat namespace. However, use of the &quot;.&quot; to denote
hierarchy is only a convention, since types are properly considered to
be opaque tokens.</P>

<H3>3.3 LINK</H3>

<H3>3.3.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>The LINK method requests that a single typed unidirectional hypertext
link be created on the Request-URI. This link consists of three fields,
a source URI, a destination URI, and a type, which is an opaque token.
The source URI is the beginning of the link, the destination URI is the
endpoint of the link, and the type describes the relationship between the
source and destination resources. A link may be interpreted as a binary
relationship between the source and destination resources, which has the
meaning, &quot;the destination resource contains information of relation
&lt;type&gt; to the source resource.&quot; A link may also be interpreted
as an attribute-value pair, where the attribute name is the link type,
and the value is pointed to by the destination of the link.</P>

<P>The specification of the requested link is made in the message body
of the LINK request, which SHOULD be of content type &quot;application/link&quot;.
The source URI of the link will typically correspond to the Request-URI
of the LINK request, but MUST not be required to do so. Either the source
URI or the destination URI of the link MUST correspond to the Request-URI
of the LINK request. This ensures that the Request-URI is part of the link
being defined.</P>

<P>If the source URI is ommitted in the link specification, the source
URI defaults to the Request-URI. If the destination URI is ommitted in
the link specification, the destination URI defaults to the Request-URI.
</P>

<P>Some servers may automatically allocate part of their namespace for
link information of a specific type. For example, the creation date of
a resource at URL &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/resource.html&gt; might be
accessed from &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/resource.html?create_date&gt;.
In this case, a user-agent would not want to specify the destination of
a link of type &quot;create_date,&quot; and instead would want the server
to automatically fill-in the correct destination URI. If the server should
specify the source or destination URI of a link, then the key word &quot;SET&quot;
is entered for the source or destination URI in the link specification.</P>

<H3>3.3.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The request body of a LINK method request is of content type application/link,
defined as:</P>

<PRE>Link = Version CRLF [ Source CRLF ] [ Destination CRLF ] Type CRLF 
Schema-Version = &quot;Schema-Version&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*Digit &quot;.&quot; 1*Digit 
Source = &quot;Source&quot; &quot;:&quot; ( URI | &quot;SET&quot; ) 
Destination = &quot;Destination&quot; &quot;:&quot; ( URI | &quot;SET&quot; ) 
Type = &quot;Type&quot; &quot;:&quot; token</PRE>

<P>The Schema-Version field specifies the version of the specification
of the application/link media type. By definition, the version of the application/link
media type specified in this document is &quot;1.0&quot;.</P>

<P><B>Example</B></P>

<PRE>Source: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/reports/Q1.html 
Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/reports/Q1_author.html 
Type: Author</PRE>

<P>This link states that the destination URI contains information about
the author of the source URI. It may also be interpreted as the value of
the author attribute of the source URI can be found in the resource pointed
to by the destination URI.</P>

<H3>3.3.3 Response Body</H3>

<P>The request body of a LINK method request is of content type application/linkresult,
defined as:</P>

<PRE>LinkResult = Version CRLF LinkSource CRLF LinkDestination CRLF Type CRLF 
LinkSource = &quot;Source&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI 
LinkDestination = &quot;Destination&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI 
Type = &quot;Type&quot; &quot;:&quot; token
</PRE>

<H3>3.3.4 Error Conditions</H3>

<P>a) there is a syntax error in the application/link message body (e.g.,
missing field values, missing type value) </P>

<P>b) the source URI and the destination URI fields are both missing </P>

<P>c) Both the source URI and the destination URI are specified, and neither
match the Request-URI.</P>

<P>d) Unsupported Type - The server does not allow links of the specified
type to be created. </P>

<P>e) The server does not have room to store the requested link. </P>

<P>f) The server is unable to fulfill a request to automatically set an
endpoint of the link.</P>

<H3>3.5 UNLINK</H3>

<H3>3.5.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>The UNLINK method requests the removal of any link defined on the Request-URI
which exactly matches the link specification in the request message body,
which must be of content type application/unlink.</P>

<P>If there are any links which exactly match the link specification, a
description of the removed links is returned in a response body of type
application/unlinkresult.</P>

<H3>3.5.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The request body of an UNLINK method request is of content type application/unlink,
defined as:</P>

<PRE>UnLink = Version CRLF Source CRLF Destination CRLF Type CRLF</PRE>

<PRE>Schema-Version = &quot;Schema-Version&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*Digit &quot;.&quot; 1*Digit 
LinkSource = &quot;Source&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI 
LinkDestination = &quot;Destination&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI 
Type = &quot;Type&quot; &quot;:&quot; token</PRE>

<P>The Schema-Version field specifies the version of the specification
of the application/unlink media type. By definition, the Schema-Version
of the application/unlink media type specified in this document is &quot;1.0&quot;.</P>

<H3>3.5.3 Response Body</H3>

<P>The response body of an UNLINK method is of content type application/unlinkresult,
defined as:</P>

<PRE>UnLinkResult = Version CRLF 1*(LinkSource CRLF LinkDestination CRLF Type CRLF)</PRE>

<PRE>Schema-Version = &quot;Schema-Version&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*Digit &quot;.&quot; 1*Digit 
LinkSource = &quot;Source&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI 
LinkDestination = &quot;Destination&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI 
Type = &quot;Type&quot; &quot;:&quot; token
</PRE>

<H3>3.5.4 Error Conditions</H3>

<P>a) there is a syntax error in the application/unlink message body (e.g.,
missing fields, missing field values, missing type value) </P>

<P>b) Both the source URI and the destination URI are specified, and neither
match the Request-URI.</P>

<P>c) No links match the specification in the request message body. </P>

<H3>3.6 LINKSEARCH</H3>

<H3>3.6.1 Method Definition </H3>

<P>The LINKSEARCH method is used to search on the link tuple space. The
search occurs in the URI namespace. Search points and scope define the
area of name space to be searched. The search points are URIs from which
the search should start. The scope defines the number of levels into the
URI namespace the search should go down. The search syntax is in prefix
notation in order to ease processing by the server.</P>

<H3>3.6.2 Request Body </H3>

<P>The Request-URI is the search arbiter, and it is the job of that resource
to process the request and return the results. </P>

<P>The media type is application/linksearch.</P>

<P>This syntax is adapted from [RFC1959] and [RFC1960]. </P>

<PRE>LinkSearchMethod = Schema-Version CRLF [SearchPoints] CRLF SearchPattern CRLF Scope CRLF
SearchPoints = &quot;SearchPoints&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#URI 
SearchPattern = &quot;SearchPattern&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*SearchOperations
SearchOperations = And | Or | Not | Item
And = &quot;&amp;&quot; 2*SearchOperations
Or = &quot;|&quot; 2*SearchOperations
Not = &quot;!&quot; SearchOperations 
Item = Operator CompareTo MatchPattern
Operator = &quot;=&quot; | &quot;!=&quot;
CompareTo = &quot;Source&quot; | &quot;Destination&quot; | &quot;Type&quot;
MatchPattern = 1*(token | &quot; *&quot;) CRLF 
Scope = &quot;Scope&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*Digit | &quot;Sub&quot; </PRE>

<P>The SearchPoints are URIs on which the search is to be performed. If
at least one URI is not listed in SearchPoints then the search point becomes
the request-URI. </P>

<P>The operator is equals &quot;=&quot; or not equals &quot;!=&quot;. Source
and Destination equality are dependent upon the type of URIs. Please refer
to the definition of the referenced URI type to determine equality rules.
The server MUST NOT compare URIs with which it is not familiar. Two types
are equal if their tokens are octet for octet equal. </P>

<P>The MatchPattern allows for wildcard matching. Inserting spaces prevents
the wildcard character to not be confused with characters in the token.
A wildcard character matches zero or more characters. </P>

<P>The scope operator specifies how deep into the URI namespace the search
should go. A scope of 0 means the search is only on the search point(s).
A scope higher than zero means the search should proceed scope levels down
the URI namespace. A scope of &quot;sub&quot; means the search should go
all the way down to the leaves of the namespace. </P>

<P>Redirects may only be followed if the new location is within the defined
search space. </P>

<H2>4. Distributed Authoring and Versioning Link Schema</H2>

<P>This section specifies only those link types which are absolutely necessary
to implement the functionality described in this specification. Link types
other than the ones described within are possible, but must be defined
in other documents. Since there are many different possible relationships
which can exist between resources, there are many different link types
which can exist to describe these relationships. It is difficult, if not
impossible to enumerate and describe all of these relationships, especially
since the meaning of the same type may vary depending on usage context.
This specification has therefore chosen not to try and enumerate all possible
link types, instead providing a mechanism for discovering which link types
(DAV.SupportedLinkTypes), and which sets of link types (DAV.SupportedLinkSchemas)
are supported on a resource.</P>

<P>A server is not required to support all of the DAV Link Types. However,
if a server supports a DAV Link Type, it SHOULD maintain the consistency
of that relationship by ensuring the contents of the Destination URI are
always up-to-date.</P>

<P>The DAV Link Types specified in this document form the &quot;DAV&quot;
link schema. </P>

<P>All DAV schema links have a source URI which is the resource being described
by the link. The destination URI alway points to a resource whose content
type, and contents are described below for each DAV link type.</P>

<H3>4.1 DAV.Versioning.History</H3>

<H3>4.1.1 Link Definition</H3>

<P>The history link returns information about the history of a versioned
document. This information is contained within a DAG that describes the
ancestors and children of various versions in the tree. The history link
MUST be defined on the tree handle and SHOULD be defined on individual
versions. Versions that do not have a history link MUST have a tree link
defined on them. </P>

<H3>4.1.2 Link Type</H3>

<P>The history link has type DAV.Versioning.History.</P>

<H3>4.2.3 Destination Body</H3>

<P>The destination body of the history link is a text/html file containing
a series of web collections of type &quot;DAV/History&quot;.</P>

<P>WC Tag Attributes:</P>

<PRE>Type = &quot;DAV/History&quot;
Name = VersionToken</PRE>

<P>WCAT Tag Attributes and/or WCDATA Entry:</P>

<PRE>Rel = (&quot;ParentEntry&quot; | &quot;ChildEntry&quot; | &quot;SiblingEntry&quot;)
Version = Token
HREF = Pointer to a web collection w/more information</PRE>

<PRE>Rel = (&quot;Parent&quot; | &quot;Child&quot; | &quot;Sibling&quot;)
Version = Token
HREF = Pointer to a parent, child, or sibling.</PRE>

<P>The Rel/Version/HREF triples above can be used with WCAT or WCDATA.
The *Entry links provide pointers to web collections with more information
about the family member. The version tag provides the version of the relative
being pointed to. The second Rel/Version/HREF triple provides a pointer
directly to the versioned resource. All attributes defined on HCs MAY also
be used here to provide information such as creation date, author, owner,
etc.</P>

<H3><B>4.2 DAV.Versioning.CheckedOut</B></H3>

<P>A server MAY create a link of type DAV.Versioning.CheckedOut on the
check out root(s), the working resource, or both. The destination resource
of a DAV.Versioning.CheckedOut link is of content type application/checkoutresult,
which contains the same information as the response body to the CHECKOUT
method. invocation which caused the creation of this link. An optional
Web Collection attribute, &quot;Principal&quot; may also be included, which
holds information about the principal(s) who initiated the check out. </P>

<H3><B>Principal</B></H3>

<H3><B>4.3 DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished. </B></H3>

<P>A server MAY create a link of type DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished on
the version tree handle and all members of the version tree pointed to
by the handle. The destination resource of a DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished
link is a member of the version tree, and points to the version which has
been designated as being appropriate for display to non-editors. The DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished
destination resource SHOULD be returned to non-DAV aware clients who perform
a GET on a version tree handle.</P>

<H3><B>4.4 DAV.Versioning.NextVersion </B></H3>

<P>A server MAY create a link of type DAV.Versioning.NextVersion on a versioned
resource. The destination resource of a DAV.Versioning.NextVersion link
is the version that immediately succeeds the source. A resource MAY have
multiple DAV.Versioning.NextVersion links.</P>

<H3>4.5&nbsp;DAV.SupportedLinkTypes</H3>

<P>Destination resource content type: Web Collection <BR>
Synytax: TBD</P>

<P>The contents of the destination resource is a list of the link types
which the server will definitely allow to be created on the source URI.
The server may allow the creation of links with types other than those
contained in the destination resource, but this is not guaranteed.</P>

<P>If a server supports a particular schema, then all link types in the
supported schema SHOULD be returned in the destination resource of a SupportedLinkTypes
link.</P>

<P>If a server implements the LINK method, it MUST also implement the SupportedLinkTypes
link.</P>

<H3>4.6 DAV.SupportedLinkSchemas</H3>

<P>Destination resource content type: Web Collection <BR>
Syntax: TBD</P>

<P>The contents of the destination resource is a list of link schemas.
If a link schema is listed, it means that the server SHOULD allow the creation
of links with types belonging to that schema. The server may allow the
creation of links with types which do not belong to a schema listed in
the destination resource, but this is not guaranteed.</P>

<P>If a server implements the LINK method, it SHOULD also implement the
SupportedLinkSchemas link.</P>

<H2>5. Relationships</H2>

<P>[Ed. Note: This section will be removed from the spec and appended]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2>6. Locking</H2>

<H3>6.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>The mechanism for locking and unlocking a resource involves the use
of a &quot;lock token&quot; (LockToken) which is used to reference the
instantiation of the lock. Each lock token instantiates the occurrence
of a lock on one resource or a specified portion of a resource (i.e., a
lock on a range of a resource). The locking of multiple resources will
cause the instantiation of an equal number of lock tokens. </P>

<P>Lock tokens represent a lock that is specific to the context of a server
and therefore can not be transferred to another server. Nor is it allowable
to transfer the LockToken to another &quot;client space&quot; even if both
are instantiated on the same server. A &quot;client space&quot; is defined
as the data space in the context of the client obtaining the lock. More
than one thread can be active in a given &quot;client space.&quot; </P>

<P>A mechanism is provided to ensure that a method is executed only if
a lock is in place. This mechanism allows a lock header to be included
in the method request. The method will be executed only if the LockToken
is still valid. Multiple LockTokens may be include in the lock header.
Lock headers may reference any LockToken allowing the submission of a method
on a resource with a LockToken that refers to another resource. </P>

<P>A lock may designate &quot;write exclusive&quot; on a given resource.
&quot;Write exclusive&quot; is currently the only type of lock supported.
A single range for the &quot;write exclusive&quot; lock may be defined
and overlapping ranges are never allowed. Thus a lock on the entire resource
would be exclusive of any and all range locks on the same resource. Multiple
range locks may be instantiated for a given resource (even among multiple
&quot;user spaces&quot;), but overlapping ranges are not permitted. The
following table describes the allowable states: </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5 >
<TR>
<TD align="center">
<H4>Request</H4>

<TR>
<TD>partial</TD>

<TD>none</TD>

<TD>granted</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>* if no overlap </P>

<P>Once defined the definition of the lock range may not be modified. The
only mechanism supported is to release the lock and instantiate a new lock
with a defined range. </P>

<P>The size of a resource may not be changed within the defined region
of a lock range unless the range includes +n (n&gt;0) octets beyond the
end of the resource (eof). By definition, locking a range beyond the eof
provides the owner with the ability to add to the eof and therefore extend
the resource. </P>

<P>If an entire resource is locked and the lock owner deletes the resource
then the write lock remains. Further actions on the resource (e.g. PUT)
are allowed because the LockToken is still instantiated. </P>

<P>Each lock may have a time out associated with it. If no time out value
is associated with the lock then the lock will never time out (implementors
should have some mechanism for destroying a lock at an administrative level).
Otherwise the lock will expire if the designated amount of time has elapsed
without a method being invoked on the resource by the lock owner. The time
out value may be modified without affecting the rest of the the lock by
submitting a lock request for the LockToken with no other values associated
with it other than a new time out value.</P>

<H3>6.2 LOCK</H3>

<H3>6.2.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P><I>[Ed. Note: Need description of LOCK method.]</I></P>

<P>The Request-URI of the LOCK method is the URI of the resource to be
locked.</P>

<H3>6.2.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The lock request specifies the target of the lock, parameters of the
lock, and requests that a lock be set on the resource. </P>

<H2>7. Name Space Manipulation</H2>

<H3>7.1 COPY</H3>

<H3>7.1.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>This method requests the server to manipulate the mapping for the resource
in the namespace such that a new location (mapping) is created for the
Request-URI in the namespace, while maintaining the existing location (mapping)
in the namespace. The actual implementation is left to the discretion of
the server. The presence of hyperlinks within a resource creates special
problem in Web resources. The fact that these hyperlinks could be either
absolute or relative create yet another level of complexity.</P>

<P>The Request-URL will be the URL for the source resource which will be
copied to the destination. In case of a versioned resource, depending on
the implementation, it may be either the root of the version tree, in which
case it may mean to copy the whole tree or a specific version (depending
on the value of request-version), or it may be the version tree history.
In case of non-versioned resource, it will refer to the resourse itself.</P>

<P>The message body will contain the URL of the destination of the COPY.
The OVERWRITE header, as defined by this spec., defines the behavior of
the server if a resource already exists as referred to by destination URL.
If the value of the overwrite header is true (default), then any existing
resource referenced by the destination URL will be overwritten. If the
value of overwrite header is false then the copy will fail when the URL
of an existing resource matches that of the destination URL. In case of
non-versioned collections, COPY can be used as one of the ways to add to
the collection.</P>

<H3>7.1.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The information about the destination and the switch to determine if
the links need to copied as well, will be passed in the message body which
should be of the content type &quot;application/copy&quot;. Also defined
in the body is a switch called &quot;copylink&quot;. If the value of this
switch is set to true, then the server should copy all the links that it
deems pertinent. This spec. leaves it to the discretion of the server to
determine which links are or are not appropriate in the context of copy.
When links are copied the following condition MUST be met: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The types of the links should be maintained across the copy.</LI>

<LI>If the source field of a link matches Request-URI, then the source
field of the link on the copy destination should be destination URI.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The defination of the content type Application/Copy is as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>copy = Schema-Version CRLF destination CRLF copylink CRLF [request-version CRLF]
Schema-Version = 1*DIGIT &quot;.&quot; 1*DIGIT
destination = &quot;destination&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI
copylink = &quot;copylink&quot; &quot;:&quot; value
value = &quot;true&quot; | &quot;false&quot;
request-version = &quot;Request-Version&quot; &quot;:&quot; token
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Note: COPY and Version Trees</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The request-version token may be used to refer to a versioned resource
by its version ID, in which case the Request-URI must point to the version
tree handle. If the Request-URI points to the version tree handle and the
request-version field is not provided, then the whole tree will be copied
to the new location.</P>

<P>The following rules apply when a versioned resource is invloved in a
copy operation:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A versioned resource can be copied into a non-versioned space.</LI>

<LI>A versioned resource cannot be copied into another versioned resource.</LI>

<LI>A non-versioned resource cannot be copied into a versioned resource.</LI>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>7.1.3 Response Body</H3>

<P>The response body returns the status code back.</P>

<H3>7.1.4 Error Conditions</H3>

<P>The following status codes may be returned:</P>

<P>OK - The server has successfully copied the resource, and all the links,
if applicable, to the new location in the namespace.</P>

<P>Copy failed due to some internal error:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The source is missing<BR>
The desitination exists (and the overwrite switch is false)<BR>
One or more links (in case copylink switch is true) failed to copy due
to some internal error.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>7.2 COPYHEAD</H3>

<H3>7.2.1 Definition</H3>

<P>This is a discovery method to be used with COPY method. Since it is
the server's discretion to choose the links that it deems appropriate to
copy with the new resource location, these links have to be discoverable.
COPYHEAD provides this discovery mechanism to the client. The Request-URI
will be the URI for the source resource which will be copied to the destination.
In case of a versioned resource, it will be the version tree handle. In
case of non-versioned resource, it will refer to the resourse itself. The
information about the destination (and the switch to determine if the links
need to copied as well) will be passed in the message body which should
be of the content type &quot;Application/Copyhead&quot;.</P>

<H3>7.2.2 Request Body</H3>

<H3>7.3 MOVE</H3>

<H3>7.3.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>This method requests the server to manipulate the resource/namespace
mapping; a new location (mapping) is created for the Request-URI in the
namespace, and the existing location (mapping) in the namespace is removed.
The actual implementation is left to the discretion of the server.</P>

<P>Move can be considered as an atomic, logical operation combining a COPY
followed by a DELETE on the source URI. This means MOVE inherits all the
complexities of COPY operation, and add a few more of its own due to the
fact that it changes the resource location in the namespace.</P>

<P>For instance: from the perspective of the client, a MOVE on a resource
may result in a REDIRECT to the new location namespace. WEBDAV does not
require a server to issue a redirect on &quot;moved&quot; URIs in order
to be compliant, but one might argue that some sort of discovery for &quot;server
capability&quot; be provided.</P>

<P>Also there is an issue of &quot;level of intelligence&quot; of move.
One argument is that due to the special nature of HTML media types, move
should automatically perform some link management on links after a MOVE.
While it is impossible to manage all links pointing to a resource due to
lack of control over all of the links pointing to the resource, it is conceivable
that links from a resource, and links within a resource might be manageable.
The opposing argument to this is that allowing a move operation to have
side-effects which could modify the resource being moved - or worse yet
modify resources which were not being moved - can have unexpected consequences.
It is important to know the consequences of an operation before executing
the operation.</P>

<P>WEBDAV is silent on MOVE/link interaction issues, specifying a simple
MOVE with a discoverable list of links to be moved with the resource. Beyond
that WEBDAV does not make any recommendation or suggestions about the actual
implementation of the MOVE operation.</P>

<P>In case of non-versioned collections, move can be used as one of the
ways to add to the collection.</P>

<H3>7.3.2 Request Body</H3>

<H3>7.4 MOVEHEAD</H3>

<H3>7.4.1 Header Definition</H3>

<P>This is a discovery method to be used with MOVE method. Since it is
the server's discretion to choose the links that it deems appropriate to
move with the new resource location, these links have to be discoverable.
MOVEHEAD provides this discovery mechanism to the client. The Request-URI
is the URI for the resource to be moved. In case of a versioned resource,
it will be the version tree handle. In case of non-versioned resource,
it will refer to the resourse itself. The information about the destination
(and the switch to determine if the links need to moved as well) are passed
in the message body (content type &quot;Application/Movehead&quot;).</P>

<H3>7.4.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The definition of application/movehead is exactly the same as move</P>

<H3>7.4.3 Response Body</H3>

<P>The response is a Web Collection of type DAV/MOVEHEAD with BNF identical

the server deems appropriate to move with the destination URI.</P>

<P>To move a resource pointed to by http://foo.bar.com/foobar.html, with
a link of the type &quot;Author&quot; and destination URI http://foo.bar.com/junk,

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>7.5 DESTROY</H3>

<P>To destroy a resource is permanently remove a resource from storage.
To delete a resource is to request that the resource no longer be made
available for editing. Destory differs from delete in that a versioning
system may allow a deleted resource to be visible, but not&nbsp;editable,
while a destroy causes the resource, and all knowledge about the resource
to be removed from the server. &nbsp;A destroy is performed by the DESTROY
method. The request-URI of the DESTROY method is the resource to be destroyed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>7.6 UNDELETE</H3>

<P>An undelete undoes the action of a delete, making a deleted resource
available for editing. &nbsp;An undelete is performed by executing the
UNDELETE method. The request-URI is the resource to be undeleted. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2>8. URI Collections</H2>

<H3>8.1 URI Collection Behavior</H3>

<P>According to The Random House College Dictionary - Revised Edition,
Collection is defined as &quot;2. Something that is collected, as a group
of objects...&quot; In the most generic sense a URI Collection brings together
a group of URIs and provides information about them. This specification
will not be defining such a collection, mostly because it is a pretty idea
with no where to go. At least for now. In the future systems will be available
that will be able to make profitable use of a generic collection. For now
this specification defines the Hierarchical Collection (HC). The HC is
meant to walk, talk, and look just like a directory in a file system. URIs
are added to an HC as either relative or absolute. All relative URIs in
an HC are relative to the Request-URI. This restriction is in place in
order to replicate normal file system behavior. Thus if the collection
is copy, moved, or otherwise manipulated within the name space it will
be possible to copy, move, etc. its component parts. This behavior is referred
to as propagation. The idea is that a command executed on the collection
can be propagated to all the relative URIs. The PropagateLevel header controls
propagation behavior. This header specifies the number of levels a command
should be propagated. Absolute URIs are added as links and thus commands
are not propagated through them. Thus, if a collection is copied, the COPY
method will be executed on all the relative URIs but not on the absolute
URIs. Of course all the absolute URI entries will still be members of the
collection, they simply won't have the COPY method executed on them. </P>

<P>Executing the MAKECOLLECTION method creates HCs. This is the same as
executing a MKDIR on a file system. If a MAKECOLLECTION is executed on
a Request-URI which is not itself a member of a collection then either
the system will automatically create all the necessary collections or it
will reject the method. Once the collection is created any URI PUT under
the collection's namespace will &quot;magically&quot; appear inside the
collection. Again, this behavior mimics that of a normal file system. Adding
a relative URI directly to a collection will either be rejected or cause
a NULL file to appear. Removing a URI directly from a collection will cause
a link to disappear in the case of an absolute URI or will cause the file
to be deleted in the case of a relative URI.</P>

<H3>8.2 CREATECOLLECTION Method</H3>

<H3>8.2.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>The CREATECOLLECTION method indicates to the server that the clients
wishes a specified URI to act as a collection.</P>

<H3>8.2.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The contents of message/collection identify what sort of collection
is being created. This document defines the Hierarchical Collection (HC).
A HC only supports a hierarchical name space and is meant to replicate
the behavior of a file system directory.</P>

<P>A HC contains URIs. URIs may be entered as relative or absolute. Relative
URIs must be relative to the request-URI. A relative URI is a propagate
entry. If a PropagateLevel header is included with a method executed on
a HC then the method will be propagated through all relative URIs. Absolute
URI entries do not propagate.</P>

<H3>8.3 ADDRESOURCE</H3>

<P><I>Editor: this section needs to incorporate the correct text from Yaron.</I></P>

<H3>8.3.1 Content Type Definition</H3>

<P>This content type is used to add a link to a collection. In the case
of an HC most systems will not accept a relative URI. Rather, to add a
new entry to an HC, the resource should be created using a PUT or similar
method. If the server does accept a relative URI for an HC then the result
SHOULD be the creation of an empty resource.</P>

<H3>8.3.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>URIType indicates the type of URI while URIEntry indicates the actual
URI. URIType is included for negotiation purposes. If the URI is relative
then it is relative to the request-URI. The productions relativeURI and
absoluteURI are defined in section 3.2.1 of rfc2068.</P>

<P>This content type is used to remove a URI from a collection. In the
case of an HC most systems will not accept a relative URI. Rather, to delete
an HC entry, the resource should be DELETEd or DESTROYed. If the server
does accept a relative URI for an HC then the result SHOULD be the deletion
of the resource.</P>

<H3>8.5.1 Header Definition</H3>

<P>The PropagateLevel header controls how many levels a method will be
propagated down a collection. Zero means the method should only be executed
on the collection. Infinity means the method should be propagated as far
down as possible. A loop is impossible with HCs because its name space
is a tree and absolute URIs do not propagate. Other collection types will
have to define their own mechanisms to detect and prevent loops.</P>

<H2>9. Version Control</H2>

<H3>9.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>This specification provides interface definitions which clients may
use to perform the common versioning operations check in, check out, version
history retrieval, and merge. A fundamental assumption of this specification
is that the semantics of versioning operations are defined by the server,
and may vary from server to server, depending on the versioning engine
employed. As a consequence, this specification provides a common interface
for accessing the functionality of many different versioning engines. </P>

<P>Since versioning functionality may vary from server to server, or even
in different namespaces on the same server, a discovery mechanism is provided
for clients to determine precisely what effect a CHECKOUT or a CHECKIN
method invocation will have on the state of the server. A client may query
the server for its CHECKIN and CHECKOUT semantics by retrieving the destination
resource of the DAV.Discovery.CHECKOUT and DAV.Discovery.CHECKIN links.
It is expected that a client will query the value of the DAV.Discovery.CHECKOUT
link before performing a check out, and the DAV.Discovery.CHECKIN link
before performing a check in, so it knows exactly what will occur when
it issues the CHECKOUT or CHECKIN request. </P>

<P>Similarly, the who and when of setting a version identifier varies significantly:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>A version identifier MAY be specified by the client upon check out.
</LI>

<LI>Upon check out, the server MAY accept the client version identifier,
or the server MAY assign a version identifier, or the server MAY not assign
any version identifier. </LI>

<LI>If the version identifier has not already been set, the client MAY
specify a version identifier upon check in. </LI>

<LI>Upon check in, the server MAY accept the client version identifier,
otherwise the server MUST assign a version identifier unless one has already
been assigned (e.g., during check out).</LI>
</OL>

<H3>9.2 Versioning Data Model</H3>

<P>A version tree is a directed acyclic graph of versioned resources. Arcs
in the version graph indicate &quot;is-version-of&quot; (or &quot;is-successor-of&quot;)
relationships. Each versioned resource is a first-class resource, addressable
by a URI. A version tree MUST have a handle resource, known as the version
tree handle, which is used to refer to the version tree as a whole. The
contents of the handle resource MUST be a single URI (a pointer), which
is used by the versioning engine to identify the version tree as a whole.
The version handle resource MAY point to either the root object of the
version tree, or the history resource for the version tree. </P>

<P>The version tree handle MUST have server generated links of type DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished,
DAV.Discovery.CHECKIN, and DAV.Discovery.CHECKOUT, and MAY have a server
generated link of type History. Each versioned resource MAY have server
generated links of the following types: DAV.Versioning.History, DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished,
DAV.Versioning.NextVersion, DAV.Discovery.CHECKOUT, DAV.Discovery.CHECKIN.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The destination resource of the DAV.Versioning.History link SHOULD
describe the version tree, and contain comment information. </LI>

<LI>The destination of the DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished link, if this
link exists, points to the version which should be returned by default
if a GET is performed on the version tree handle URI by a DAV unaware client.</LI>

<LI>The destination URI of the each DAV.Versioning.NextVersion link, if
any such links exist, MUST point to a successor resource in the version
tree. </LI>

<LI>The destination resource of the DAV.Discovery.CHECKOUT link, if this
link exists, must contain information describing the capabilities of the
CHECKOUT method as implemented by the server on the source resource. </LI>

<LI>The destination resource of the DAV.Discovery.CHECKIN link, if this
link exists, must contain information describing the capabilities of the
CHECKIN mtethod as implemented by the server on the source resource. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Versioning is an orthogonal issue to content negotiation. Each particular
variant of a resource MAY be independently versioned, and MAY have its
own version tree. </P>

<P><B>TBD: A Figure showing a sample version tree (using text characters)</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>9.3 CHECKOUT</H3>

<H3>9.3.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>A CHECKOUT is a declaration by a client that it might edit a versioned
resource. The CHECKOUT method is intended to map to the notion of check
out supported by the server's versioning engine. The Request-URI of the
check out method is a version tree handle, which identifies the version
tree on which the CHECKOUT will be performed. </P>

<P>A server MAY create a working resource as the result of a check out.
If the server creates a working resource, it MUST return the URI of this
resource in the response body. </P>

<P>All of the activity which occurs during CHECKOUT method invocation MUST
be performed atomically. </P>

<H3>9.3.2 Checkout Capability Discovery</H3>

<P><I>Editor: this section will be subsumed by a more general method discovery
mechanism.</I></P>

<H3>9.3.3 Request Body</H3>

<P>The request body of the CHECKOUT method is of content type application/checkout,
defined as: </P>

<PRE>Checkout        = Schema-Version CRLF [Derived-From CRLF] [Request-Version CRLF]

Request-Lock    = &quot;Request-Lock&quot; &quot;:&quot; &quot;Exclusive&quot; &quot;Write&quot;

Request-Intent  = &quot;Request-Intent&quot; &quot;:&quot; (&quot;true&quot; | &quot;false&quot;)

<TT>Request-Working-Loc = &quot;Request-Working-Loc&quot; &quot;:&quot; (&quot;Client&quot; | &quot;Server&quot;)

Request-Visibility = &quot;Request-Visibility&quot; &quot;:&quot; Visible-When [Visible-Where]
Visible-When    = (&quot;Always&quot; | &quot;If_Locked&quot; | &quot;Never&quot;) 
Visible-Where   = (&quot;On_CheckOut_Root&quot; | &quot;On_Working&quot; | &quot;On_Both&quot;)</TT></PRE>

<P>The Schema-Version is the version number of the syntax specification
of the application/checkout content type. </P>

<P>Derived-From specifies the version identifier of the check-out root(s)
from which the working resource (if it exists) is derived. If more than
one version identifier is specified in the Derived-From value, the working
resource MAY be the result of a merge of the specified versions, and the
exact semantics of this merge operation will vary across versioning engines.
</P>

<P>Request-Version specifies a client's request to set the version identifier
of the working resource. The server MAY set the version identifier of the
working resource to this value. If this field is omitted from the request
message body, the server MAY perform a check out from a default check out
root (often the latest version). </P>

<P>Request-Lock is used by the client to request a lock when a server supports
optional locking on check out.</P>

<P>Request-Intent is used by the client to request the server to establish
an intent to edit on check out. An intent to edit MAY result in the association
of authentication or user information with either the check out root, or
the working resource. </P>

<P>Request-Working-Loc is used by the client to request where the working
resource is located. If the client specifies &quot;Client,&quot; then the
server SHOULD not create a working resource on the server. If the server
does not create a working resource on the server, the client SHOULD retrieve
its working resource from the check out root after successful completion
of the CHECKOUT. If the client specified &quot;Server,&quot; then the server
SHOULD create a working resource on the server.</P>

<P>Request-Visibility is used by the client to request whether to create
a DAV.Versioning.CheckedOut link, and the resource which will store the
link.&nbsp;Visible-When describes whether the DAV.Versioning.CheckedOut
link SHOULD always be created (&quot;Always&quot;), SHOULD only be created
if the check out performs a lock (&quot;If_Locked&quot;), or SHOULD never
be created (&quot;Never&quot;). Visible-Where describes where the link
SHOULD be stored: on the check out root (&quot;On_CheckOut_Root&quot;),
on the working resource (&quot;On_Working&quot;), or on both the check
out root and the working resource.</P>

<H3>9.3.4 Response Body</H3>

<P>The response body of a CHECKOUT method invocation is of content type

WC-Close           = &quot;&lt;/WC&gt;&quot;</PRE>

<P>Derived-Tree is the location of the version tree handle on which the
check out was performed. </P>

<P>Derived-Root is the location of the (possibly many) versioned resources
on which the check out operation was performed. </P>

<P>WorkURI is the location of the working resource generated by the server
on check out, if it exists. </P>

<P>WorkVersion is the version identifier of the working resource, if it
was set on check out. </P>

<P>Visibility is the location where the client can retrieve the DAV.Versioning.CheckedOut
link.</P>

<H3>9.3.5 Error conditions</H3>

<P>An error condition occurs if the following conditions hold: </P>

<P>If a client requests a version identifier on check out, but the server:<BR>
a) cannot set a version identifier<BR>
b) refuses to set a version identifier </P>

<P>If a client requests a lock, but the server doesn't support locking.
</P>

<P>If the client requests an intent to edit, but the server doesn't support
intent to edit. </P>

<P>If the client doesn't specify a Derived-From version, and the server
has no default value. </P>

<P>Syntax error in the request body. If a client requests a feature the
server doesn't support then it has committed a syntax error because the
discovery told the client what the server supports.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>9.4 CHECKIN</H3>

<H3>9.4.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>A CHECKIN is a declaration by a client that it wishes to place a resource
under version control. The CHECKIN method is intended to map to the notion
of check in supported by the versioning engine. The Request-URI for a CHECKIN
method invocation is the version tree handle of the version tree which
is being operated on. </P>

<P>A check in SHOULD clear any server state which is set as a result of
a check out. For example, if a server locks a resource on check out, it
should remove the lock upon check in. </P>

<P>To place a resource under version control for the first time, a check
in is performed on the resource. In this case, the Request-URI is the desired
location of the version tree handle, and the Working-URI or the check in
body gives the contents of the resource to be placed under version control.
</P>

<P>All of the activity which occurs during CHECKIN method invocation MUST
be performed atomically. </P>

<H3>9.4.2 Checkin Capability Discovery</H3>

<P><I>Editor: this section will be subsumed by a more general purpose discovery
mechanism</I></P>

<H3>9.4.3 Request-Body</H3>

<P>The request body of a CHECKIN method invocation MUST be in one of two
forms: </P>

<OL>
<LI>An entity of content type application/checkin </LI>

<LI>An entity of content type multipart/related, with two parts, an entity
of content type application/checkin, and a second entity, of any content
type, containing a check in body. </LI>
</OL>

<P>If the request-body is of content type multipart/related, the checkin
operation is defined to be a PUT of the checkin entity body (into a server-dependent
temporary resource), followed by a CHECKIN. </P>

<P>The definition of content type application/checkin is: </P>

<PRE>CheckIn          = Schema-Version CRLF [Derived-From CRLF]

                   [Working-Resource CRLF] [Request-Version CRLF] 

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">                   </FONT>[Check-In-Location CRLF]



Schema-Version   = &quot;Schema-Version&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1*DIGIT &quot;.&quot; 1*DIGIT

Derived-From     = &quot;Derived-From&quot; &quot;:&quot; #token

Request-Version  = &quot;Request-Version&quot; &quot;:&quot; token

Working-Resource = &quot;Working-Resource&quot; &quot;:&quot; ( &quot;[&quot; URI &quot;]&quot; ) | 

                   (&quot;VersionID&quot; &quot;:&quot; token) | &quot;BODY&quot;</PRE>

<P>The Schema-Version is the version number of the syntax specification
of the application/checkout content type. </P>

<P>Derived-From specifies the version identifier of the check-out root(s)
from which the working resource (if it exists) is derived. If more than
one version identifier is specified in the Derived-From value, the checked-in
resource MAY be entered as the successor of the Derived-From resources.
</P>

<P>Request-Version specifies a client's request to set the version identifier
of the check in resource. The server MAY set the version identifier of
the check in resource to this value. If this field is omitted from the
request message body, the server MUST set the version identifier if it
has not previously been set. </P>

<P>Working-Resource specifies a URI or a version identifier of the working
resource which is to be checked-in. If the value is &quot;BODY,&quot; the
working resource is contained in the check in body.</P>

<P><I>Open issues: 1 - If a version has multiple parents the client wants
to know where the version links will go. If the system supports multiple
inheritance then that needs to be stated. If the system only supports single
inheritance then the client needs to know, before hand, which version the
new version will be linked to. 2 - The syntax allows a client to specify
different derived-from resources on Check In then were listed on Check
Out. Somewhere there is a versioning system that doesn't allow this. The
client needs to know this fact before performing the check out.</I></P>

<H3>9.4.4 Response Body</H3>

<P>There is no response body defined for the CHECKIN method. </P>

<H3>9.4.5 Error Conditions</H3>

<P>If the Derived-From token(s) do not exist, </P>

<P>If the working URI is not located on this server, or the server is not
authorized to retrieve the working URI. </P>

<P>If the PUT of the checkin entity body fails. </P>

<P>Syntax error in the request body. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>9.5 DIFF/MERGE</H3>

<H3>9.5.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>The request-URI of the DIFF method is an arbiter. The arbiter will compare
the entries and return the differences between them.</P>

<P>The request-URI of the MERGE method is also an arbiter. The arbiter
will combine the entries and return the result.</P>

<P>The Application/Diff content-type works with the DIFF method. The Application/Merge
content-type works with the Merge method.</P>

<P><TT>Application/Diff = Body<BR>
Application/Merge = Body<BR>
Body = 1#(&quot;URI&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI | &quot;Entity&quot; &quot;:&quot;
entity-body)</TT> </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>9.5.2 SERVERMERGE</H3>

<H3>9.5.2.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>The SERVERMERGE method requests that the server merge a number of entities
on behalf of the client. The request-URI is a server side arbiter who performs
the merge on behalf of the client.</P>

<H3>9.5.2.2 Request Body</H3>

<P>The request body may take on one of two possible formats. One format
is application/servermerge, which is defined below. The second format is
message/multipart related which will contain an entry of type application/servermerge
as well as entities for the server to merge.</P>

<P>Type = application/servermerge</P>

<PRE><TT>Merge = Schema-Version CRLF MergeType CRLF [MergeEntities CRLF] 
        ReturnType CRLF [ReturnURI CRLF]
MergeType = &quot;Merge Types&quot; &quot;:&quot; (&quot;URIs&quot; | &quot;Bodies&quot; | &quot;URIs&quot; &quot;Bodies&quot;)
MergeEntities = &quot;Merge Entries&quot; &quot;:&quot; #URI
ReturnType = &quot;Return Result&quot; &quot;:&quot; (&quot;URI&quot; | &quot;Body&quot;)
ReturnURI = &quot;Return Location&quot; &quot;:&quot; URI</TT></PRE>

<P>MergeType specifies what mechanisms are being used to refer to bodies
to be merged. URIs means that a MergeEntities has been included while Bodies
indicates that one or more message/multipart related have been included.
ReturnType specifies how the results are to be returned, either as part
of the response or recorded in a URI. ReturnURI specifies the URI for the
result to be recorded in if the user selects that return mechanism. A server
MAY support any combination of values for MergeType and ReturnType. It
MUST provide for discovery of supported values.</P>

<H3>9.5.2.3 Response Body</H3>

<P>Only support # bodies to be merged</P>

<P>Can not resolve URI </P>

<P>Can not store in URI</P>

<P>Can not merge included types</P>

<P>Merge Failed</P>

<P>Merge Succeeded</P>

<H3>9.5.2.4 Response Codes</H3>

<P>[Will fold in from above.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>9.6 Command Comments </H3>

<P>Command comments are entity headers. </P>

<P><TT>Command_Comment = &quot;Comment&quot; &quot;:&quot; CommentVal<BR>
CommentVal = URI | comment</TT> </P>

<P>This is the standard comment facility used by versioning systems. Servers
that do not understand the header or do not wish to make use of the information
are free to ignore the information. No specification is made regarding
how this information is to be retrieved. It is likely, however, that most
systems will make the command comments available through their history
attribute. </P>

<H3>9.7&nbsp;FREEZE (a.k.a. UNVERSION) </H3>

<P><I>Editor: this method should be viewed as proposed functionality.</I></P>

<H3>9.7.1 Method Definition</H3>

<P>This method request the server to freeze the version tree in the current
state, and copy the default published version outside of versioning space
so that it is accessible as an unversioned resource to the client. After
the version tree is frozen, the clients will not be able to perform any
operation except CHECKIN at which time the tree will be taken out of the
frozen state and put back into the version space. The Request-URI is the
URI of the version tree handle.</P>

<H3>9.7.2 Request Body </H3>

<P>None.</P>

<H3>9.7.3 Response</H3>

<P>The response will only consist of the status code as returned by the
server.</P>

<H3>9.7.4 Error Conditions</H3>

<P>The error codes could any of the following: </P>

<P>OK - the server successfully froze the version tree and copied the Default
Published Version into non-version space. <BR>
FREEZE failed because the server could not freeze the tree. <BR>
FREEZE failed because the server could not copy the default published version
to unversioned space <BR>
FREEZE failed because the server could not determine the Default Published
Version <BR>
The source (tree) is missing </P>

<H2>10. Ancillary Methods and Headers</H2>

<H3>10.1 MaxLength Header </H3>

<H3>10.1.1 Header Definition </H3>

<P>The max length header requests that the server not return any results
greater than specified in the header. The header also specifies if partial
results are preferred to no results in the case when the result entity
is greater than allowed by the header. </P>

<H3>10.1.2 Header Body </H3>

<PRE>MaxLengthHeader = &quot;MaxLength&quot; &quot;:&quot; Size Partial CRLF
Size = &quot;Size&quot; &quot;:&quot; Bytes-Unit 1*Digit
Partial = &quot;Partial&quot; &quot;:&quot; (&quot;Acceptable&quot; | &quot;Not Acceptable&quot;) </PRE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>10.2 If-Lock Header </H3>

<H3>10.2.1 Header Definition </H3>

<P>The If-Lock header makes any request to which it has been appended conditional
on the lock(s) referred to by the included token(s) still being active.
This header can not be dropped. </P>

<H3>10.2.2 Header Body </H3>

<PRE>IfLockHeader = &quot;If-Lock&quot; &quot;:&quot; #LockToken CRLF </PRE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>10.3 Command-Comments Header (CCMD)</H3>

<H3>10.3.1 Header Definition</H3>

<P>Command-Comments (short form CCMD) is a request-header which is used
to transmit comment information on any HTTP request method to the server.
The server MAY provide persistent storage for the comments. The server
MAY log the comments. The server MAY ignore the comments. </P>

<H3>10.3.2 Header Body</H3>

<P>The definition of the syntax of the Command-Comments header is as follows:
</P>

<PRE>CommandComments  = (&quot;CCMD&quot; | &quot;Command-Comments&quot;) &quot;:&quot; LangTaggedString

LangTaggedString = Lang UTF-8   ; See RFC 2044 for UTF-8 definition
Lang             = &quot;(&quot; LangTag &quot;)&quot;
LangTag          = 1*8ALPHA *(&quot;-&quot;1*8ALPHA)</PRE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>10.4 Overwrite Header</H3>

<H3>10.4.1 Header Definition</H3>

<P>Overwrite is a request-header which specifies whether the destination
of the method should or should not be overwritten. </P>

<H3>10.4.2 Header Body</H3>

<PRE>Overwrite = &quot;Overwrite&quot; &quot;:&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot; | &quot;No&quot;)</PRE>

<P>If the value of Overwrite is &quot;Yes,&quot; a destination resource
will be replaced if it exists. If the value of Overwrite is &quot;No,&quot;
the server will not replace the destination resource if it exists. </P>

<P>This header may be applied to the PUT method, and thus modifies the
definition of PUT given in Section 9.6 of [HTTP/1.1].</P>

<H2>APPENDIX</H2>

<H3>A. Definition of LinkSearch Header</H3>

<P><I>Editor: This is a proposed feature.</I></P>

<P>The LinkSearch method can be expensive, especially when a number of
attributes must be retrieved over time.</P>

<P>A more economical mechanism is to append a search string to URL using
&quot;?&quot;. However, the URL could be confused with any of a number
of search syntax's. The solution proposed by this document is to create
a new header called LinkSearch.</P>

<P><TT>LinkSearch = &quot;LinkSearch&quot; &quot;:&quot; HTTP_url ; See
section 3.2.2 of [HTTP11]</TT></P>

<P>If the HTTP URL does not end in a &quot;/&quot; then a &quot;?&quot;
may be appended to it and the attribute search syntax defined below may
be used to search for attributes on that particular resource. If the URL
does end with a &quot;/&quot; then any resource whose name is a child of
the specified HTTP URL may be searched on directly.</P>

<P>To perform a search a string matching the following syntax should be
used.</P>

<P><TT>LinkSearchSuffix = &quot;?&quot; Attribute<BR>
Attribute = token</TT></P>

<P>So, if the LinkSearch value is <A HREF="http://foo/bar">http://foo/bar</A>
then a search on a link type of author would be performed using http://foo/bar?author.
If the returned value is <A HREF="http://foo/bar/">http://foo/bar/</A>
then the author search may be performed on <A HREF="http://foo/bar/">http://foo/bar/</A>?author
and any of its children, such as http://foo/bar/doublebar?author.</P>

<P>By returning the LinkSearch header the server is agreeing to manipulate
the search URL as it would the URL of the resource it resolves to. Thus
it becomes the responsibility of the server to resolve the search URL whenever
it is included in a command.</P>

<P>If it is impossible to resolve the search request to a single result
then a 416 Not Unique error should be returned. This error specifies that
the URI was not resolvable to a unique resource.</P>

<P>If the search URI does not resolve to any attribute then any request
containing that URI should return a 404 Not Found error.</P>

<H3>B. Definition of LinkPrefix Header</H3>

<P><I>Editor: this is a proposed feature.</I></P>

<P>In some cases a server may have an arbiter which handles all searches
on resources. To allow for the use of the arbiter but still gain the advantages
of URL based searching the LinkPrefix is introduced.</P>

<P><TT>LinkPrefix = &quot;LinkPrefix&quot; &quot;:&quot; HTTP_url</TT></P>

<P>To retrieve a particular attribute the following syntax should be used:</P>

<P><TT>LinkPrefixSuffix = &quot;?&quot; URL LinkSearchSuffix</TT></P>

<P>Thus the returned URL has the URL to be searched on appended to it followed
by the actual search syntax as previously specified. This allows for quick
retrieval of attribute values but with the benefit of processing requests
at a single resource.</P>

<P>The URI returned by LinkPrefix has the same use semantics as the URI
returned by LinkSearch.</P>
