      <p>Astrobiology is the study of life in the universe: its origin, evolution, distribution, and destiny. It is an intrinsically interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field involving (among others) microbiologists, astronomers, geologists, planetary scientists, environmentalists, geneticists, and evolutionary biologists. <BR>
<BR>
The NAI is a 20 year project and was established to promote interdisciplinary collaboration among astrobiology researchers through the use of information technology, promoting training for next generation astrobiology researchers, providing scientific and technical leadership for space missions, and supporting outreach through K-12 educational programs, teaching undergraduate courses, and public communication. <BR>
<BR>
The NAI is the chief NASA funding source for astrobiology research. The Institute is comprised of 15 lead teams at 14 research institutions nationwide, representing 720 individual researchers, and has partnered with four international astrobiology organizations in Europe and Australia. Members collaborate with one another, both in person and virtually, using communication and collaboration tools supplied by NAI. Lead Teams are supported by NASA through 5-year Cooperative Agreements with Ames Research Center. NAI members are also encouraged to obtain funding from NASA, NIH, NSF, or other sources for their research and educational activities. <BR>
<BR>
Collaborative efforts include virtual inter-team focus groups, an elibrary, and "Ask an astrobiologist" for students. Member services include group email,a photo directory, a web based project information repository, document exchange, annual report templates, and a general meeting forum. <BR>
<BR>
NAI sponsors astrobiology seminars, workshops, and professional training courses. It brings together the astrobiology community to provide new ideas to NASA planners. An NAI Strategic Fund is available to provide seed money for innovative research ideas. A NASA Astrobiology Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, administered by NAI in association with the National Research Council, annually selects a group of the best young astrobiology researchers and supports them directly. </p>

Monthly video seminars draw participants from many NAI Lead Teams and are open to the larger scientific and public communities. The seminars are hosted by one of the Lead Team sites. They are both webcast via the Internet and broadcast out to meeting rooms and/or desktops at other sites via the Polycom videconferencing system. Slides and other documents or images are shared with the distributed audience using the WebEx meeting tool. WebEx also includes a chat feature that has been used to facilitate exchange between presenter and remote audience members. <BR>
<BR>
Members of NAI Lead Teams have access to various handbooks, a photo directory, the NAI Emailer (a listerv manager), ScienceOrganizer, Discussion Forums, and Executive Council meeting Presentations. </td>

<BR>
The IT Working Group is a virtual team that was made possible through additional funding for working through problems with video- conferencing. Most problems were with equiptment, software compatablity across operating systems, and a lack of technical support. The technical support and funding provided by the IT Working Group has resulted in almost seamless videoconferencing. Now  local IT expertise and support are required by each Lead team Institution. <BR>
<BR>
Yearly NAI Science Conferences and InSight Courses offer opportunities for face to face communication. The InSight Course are specifically targeted to facilitate bridge-building between scientific disciplines. Previous InSight course include "Introduction to Planetary Science, For Non-Planetary Scientists" and "Introduction to the Microbial World, For Non-Microbiologists". <BR>
<BR>
To further support interdisciplinary collaboration the former director (Blumburg) encourged the formation of focus groups based on themes not disciplines.  Topics like early history of Earth and Mars landing sites are explored and membership was not limited to NAI. Collaboration is happening around shared interests.  <BR>
<BR>
The virtual institute was included for the first time as a category for poster submissions at the 2003 NAI Annual Meeting. Several members of the IT Working Group, and several NAI Central staff, as well as others, submitted proposals in the category and were invited to present posters. Posters included a general focus on virtual institute issues, such as the meaning of NAI membership, or the social and technical challenges of the virtual institute. Other posters presented projects undertaken by members of specific Lead Teams, such as the virtual classroom explored by Penn State University, data sharing tools linking the science laboratories of the Michigan State University researchers, a wireless data sharing system for remote fieldworkers designed by members of the MBL Team, and an interactive portal interface designed by CIW Team members.<BR>
<BR>
A special room was designated as a hands-on demonstration space for collaboration tools currently being offered to NAI members or explored by the NAI IT Working Group. Specific demonstration events were scheduled, and the room was also available for drop in visits by conference attendees interested in trying out tools or getting some personal coaching.<BR>

    <td width="66%">Lead Teams have access to videoconferencing hardware and software and document editing software. The decision to deploy certain tools came after a needs assesment perfomed in 2001 by the Collaboration Research Mangager with assistance from the firm FutureU.com. The needs assesment was intended to increase the collaborative effort and included an assesment of currently available commercial tools.  <BR>
<BR>
The tools in use before the needs asssesment were Polycom videoconferencing and PostDoc, an information management system developed at Ames. The assessment found videoconferencing was being used but many problems persisted. Also, PostDoc was perceived as cumbersome and irrelevant. Two and a half years into the founding of NAI it was found "good science was happening, but the way they were doing their work wasnít any different than before the institute". (L. Faithorn interview, 4.26.2004)<BR>
<BR>
Following the needs assesment each Lead Team were given NetMeeting access, WebEx, and DocuShare. WebEx has been successfully adopted through monthly science seminars. Use has revealed when users request videoconferences for their meetings, their needs may be met with the audio and shared slides that WebEx provides (without the hassle of videoconferences). Xerox's DocuShare was selected in place of OpenText's LiveLinks, which was tested for 7 months but was not selected, partly due to budget cuts. DocuShare was also seen as easier to use though LiveLink's Communities of Practice model was attractive to NAI. Also, because of a collaboration with Xerox, access to DocuShare could be secured at a low cost. <BR>
<BR>
Certain NAI teams are also particpating in the trial use of ScienceOrganizer, a locally developed knowledge management tool designed to enhance the information storage, organization, and access capabilities of distributed NASA science teams. ScienceOrganizer provides a common electronic repository in which science team members can store and share project information. Team members access the system through a web-based interface that enables them to upload, download, and organize project information -- including data, documents, images, and scientific records associated with laboratory and field experiments. Information in ScienceOrganizer is "threaded", or interlinked, to enable users to locate, track, and organize interrelated pieces of scientific data. Linkages capture important semantic relationships among information resources in the repository, and these assist users in navigating through the information related to their projects.<BR>
