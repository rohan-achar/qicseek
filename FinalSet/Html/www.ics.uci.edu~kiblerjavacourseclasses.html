<h1> Classes and Objects </h1>

 <h3> Why bother? </h3>
  <ul>
   <li> What do they give you ?
   <li> How can I find them?
   <li> How do I define them? 
  </ul> 
 <h3> Answers: </h3>
   <ul>
    <li> Provide problem decomposition, simplicity, sharing, reusability.
    <br> Simple reusable parts with simple interactions.
    <li> Finding classes: Narrowing the gap, problem ->code
     <ul>
       <li> Domain objects -> classes
       <li> What activities need to be supported? What before how.
       <li> OOP promotes separation of what and how.
       <li> Bottom-up design and inheritance: keep it simple.
       <li> Common classes: stacks, queues, trees, hashtables, etc.
       <li> Novel ones
     </ul>
    <li> Hiding information
        <ul>
          <li> hide implementation: you usually don't know what
       data structure is best (tree, list, array, ..).
          <li> Y2K problem. ignorance or tools?
        <pre>
            Class Year
            {
              char[] annum;
              Year(int n)
              {
                annum = new char[2];
                annum[0] = Character.forDigit( n%10,10);
                annum[1] = Character.forDigit( n/10,10);
              }
            public  String toString()
             {
                return "19"+String.valueOf(annum);
             }
            }
 
        </pre>            
          <li> hide ignorance: user has unclear preference
        </ul>
    <li> Getting information
       <ul>
         <li> How many objects of type P do you have?
         <li> How much work would be required to modify
           some method/routine.
      </ul>
    <li>  Change
       <ul>
           <li> We just switched to metric system. Change reporting
       and acquisition forms.
       </ul>

<h3> On learning a programming language </h3>

<i> 
    An expert programmer knows all the tricks,
   <br> and doesn't use them.  -- James Neighbors
</i>
  <br>
    For each construct you should learn:
 <ul>
  <li> Syntax: how to define
   <br> Test: compiler accepts
   <li> Semantics: what really happens 
    <br> Tests: Explain to friend, does what you expect
   <li> Purpose: why you want it
    <br> Test: you use it
  </ul>
 <h3> Defining a class and a simple application</h3>
The file is named "ComplexTest.java". Normally one puts
each class definition in a separate file and the files for
a program/project into a single directory. *DO NOT* follow
the comment style given here. These are explanatory comments
for learning the language. Alternatively you can view these
as bad comments, which are sometimes seen. We will provide
examples of good commenting style.


<pre>
     class Complex        //  end of line comment
   {
     private double x;   // private: not accessible outside of class
     private double y;   // data member
      
     Complex(double x, double y)   // constructor
       {
         this.x = x;        // x is passed parameter
         this.y = y;        // this.x is the x of the object
                            // . accesses data members
       } 
     Complex(double x)     // by Convention, class names begin with capital
      {                   // Java is case sensitive
         this(x,0);        // here "this" refers to constructor at this level
       }
     Complex()           // functions are distinguished by their parameters
     {
       this(0,0);
     }

     double getReal()     // accessor: get values of data members
    {                     // by conventions methods, start with lower case letter
       return x;
    }
     double getImaginary()
    { 
       return y;
    }
    void setReal(double x)   // mutators: change values of fields
    {
      this.x = x;
     }
    void setImaginary(double y)
    {
      this.y = y;
    }                    
    Complex  mult(Complex c)          
      {
        Complex d = new Complex(); // new allocates storage and returns reference to it.
         d.setReal( x*c.getReal() - y*c.getImaginary() );  
                 // . accesses member functions
         d.setImaginary( x*c.getImaginary() + y*c.getReal() );
        return d;
      }
 public String toString()  
/*     String is class in Java, not array of characters.
       toString() is useful for printing and debugging
       This overrides Object.toString(). Note that 
       overriding requires that the accessibility not be changed.
       toString() has unusual semantics. It is called whenever
       an object of type String is needed. Why did they do this?
*/

   {
     return(x+"+"+y+"i"); // + concatenates string objects
   }
}

public class ComplexTest   //note the class corresponds to the filename
{
  public static void main(String[] args)  // this line is required by applications
 {
   Complex c1 = new Complex(3,2); 
   Complex c2 = new Complex(1,2);
   System.out.println(c1.toString());
   System.out.println(c2); // automatic call to toString()
   System.out.println("product of c1 and c2 is ");
   System.out.println(c1.mult(c2));
   Complex c3 = new Complex(Double.valueOf(args[0]).doubleValue(),
                            Double.valueOf(args[1]).doubleValue());
   // note . is left associative
   System.out.println(c3);
 }
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li> To compile under Unix:  javac ComplexTest.java
  <br> This will generate ComplexTest.class
  <li> To run under Unix:   java ComplexTest 
   <br> this will run the "main" routine
  <li> note: A file can have at most one public class.
  <li> note: The semantics of toString() are unusual. If a string object
   is needed, say by println, and the object is not a string then
  the method toString() will be called automatically.
</ul>
  

<h3> Java Class Vector in java.util </h3>
  <p> A vector holds objects and allows addition and deletion of objects.
   You may think of it as an extensible array.
  It has 3 constructors and  about 30 methods. Vectors contain
   objects (references). If you need it, Vector probably has it.
  <ul>
  <li> Constructor: Vector()
  <li> public final synchronized void addElement(Object o); 
  <li> public final synchronized void removeElement(Object o); 
  <li> public final boolean contains(Object e);
  <li> public final synchronized Enumeration elements();
 </ul>

 <h4> Notes: </h4>
  <ul>
   <li> <strong> final  </strong> means that it can't be overridden. This
     is a safety feature.
   <li> <strong> Enumeration </strong> permits moving through items of
    data-structure one at time, as in a for-loop.
   <li> Enumeration is an interface that has only two methods, namely:
        <ul>
          <li> hasMoreElements()
          <li> nextElement()
        </ul>  
   <li> <strong> synchronized </strong> provides the ability to control
    who  updates the vector, for example to prevent multiple simultaneous
    deletions from same  bank account.
 </ul>
 <h3> Address Book: Class Exercise </h3>
    <p> What are the objects: book, address, name, last-name,...
    <p> What are the behaviors: 
 <h3> Static Classes and Static Methods </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Java has no global functions or globals constants.
    <li> Global functions are implemented as static member functions.
    <li> Ex.  Math.random() is the function in the class Math which
         generates a random number.
    <li> Global constants are implemented as static  member objects. By
   convention constants are in all caps.
    <li> Ex.  Math.PI  stands for the constant 3.14....
    <li> Notice that we did not create an instance of the class Math.
        These constants and functions are attached to the class itself.
  </ul>
 <h4> Example </h4>
   Return to the Complex number class.  Suppose we want to
   count the number of complex numbers our program  generated.
   To do this  add a static data member "count" and modify our
   constructors.  Static functions can only access static data
   members. We also add a corresponding  print function.
   

<pre>
  public  class Complex
  {
     private static int count = 0;    // int is associated with class
   
     private double x;   // x,y are associated with each instance of class
     private double y;
      
     Complex(double x, double y)   
       {
         this.x = x;        
         this.y = y;        
         count++;
       } 

     ...
   
    public static printCount()   
    { 
      System.out.println("Number of Complex numbers used is "+count);
    }
    // The output goes to the console. It would be called with
    //  Complex.printCount();     
</pre>
   Notice that static functions are not passed a "this" parameter.


<h3> Java Semantics </h3>
 <ul>
   <li> Semantics are defined operationally or procedural, ie.
    by what the compiler/interpreter does.
   <li> Recall: Java program is collection of classes.
   <li> One class must have the same name as the file. This is
      the main or "driver" class. This class is a bit unusual as
     is allows command-line interaction. However it is derived from
     Object and has an implicit call to "super()";
   <li> Before an object of a class is used, it must be constructed,
     except for the "driver" class or classes without data members.
   <li> When an object's lifetime is over, it is automatically
   garbage-collected. This removes a major source of errors from
   languages that require the programmer to free memory. Memory
   leaks have been a major source of problems with code.
   <li> The order of classes or methods in a class is unimportant.
    The language processor will sort out the order, unlike in C or C++.
    This removes an annoyance.
   <li> If a class has static variables and/or static expressions,
     these are initialize/executed at load-time as they need to be available
     for the objects of the class.
   <li> Order of loading classes determines order of execution of static
   expression blocks.
   <li> The "main" routine in the driver class of an
     application will be the first one that is executed. The driver
   class of an application must  contain a definition of
   <br> <em> public static void main(String[] args) </em>
   <li> Other classes may have "main" routines which is useful for debugging.
   <li>  In applets, the "driver" class must extend an Applet. We will
    discuss the interpretation of applets later.
    
 </ul>
<h3> Design Rules (from Eiffel school) </h3>
  <ul>
   <li> Eiffel is an  Object-Oriented language that
   came after C++ but before Java. Eiffel
   does not rest on C but stressed object-oriented design,
   bottom-up implementation, inheritance, programming by
   contract, and use of assertions for preconditions and postconditions.
   The goal was high-quality software.
  <li> Why isn't this a succesful language?
  <li> Classes should have few data members and many simple functions.
  <li> A class defines the behavior of an object.
  <li> If you repeat code, your design is wrong.
  <li> If your code is complicated, your design is probably wrong.
  <li> Reuse classes by inheritance.
  <li> Reuse classes by creating multiple object of the class.
 <li> Code and test each class separately. (not always possible)
  <li> Push code up the inheritance hierarchy.
  <li> Novice coders use "grab and run".
  <li> Experienced coders use "guess, check and iterate".
   <li> Redesign: learn from the process.
 </ul>
<h3> Object-Oriented Design Review </h3>
 <ul> 
  <li> Classes are new, user defined types.
  <li> Classes define objects and hide implementations.
  <li> Dependencies define relationships among classes.
  <li> Dependencies allow for reuse and variation.
  <li> Static-type checking promotes integration correctness,
       efficiency, and comprehensibility.
   <li> Bottom-up design yields more reuse, but also more less
       abstraction.
   <li> Top-design yields more better organization but less reuses.
   <li> Proper design entails mixing top-down design and 
    and bottom-up design to maximize information-hiding (Parnas).
 </ul>
<h3> Class/Object Summary </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> An object is an instance of a class.
    <li> Each object has data members, corresponding to what
    objects knows, and data functions, corresponding to what
    an object can do.
    <li> Be sure you can distinguish class members and object members.
    <li> Arrays and Strings are objects in Java.
    <li> Checklist of methods: constructors, accessors, mutators.
    <li> Java does not have destructors as it uses garbage collection,
    which can be called(scheduled) explicitly. 
    <li> A class is a user-defined type.
    <li> Objects help bridge the gap between the problem and
        code by decomposing the process.
    <li> Domain classes are derived from domain analysis. They
     model the world.
    <li> Code classes are built from the primitive types. These
    increase the level of abstraction of the code.
    <li> Beyond minimality, add useful operations.
    <li> For each class, expect to define constructors, accessors, and mutators.
    <li> Functions can return objects.
  </ul>

<h3> Primitive Types </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>  The primitive types in Java are: boolean, char, byte, short,
  int, long, float and double.
   <li> Primitive types are not objects.
   <li> Wrappers convert primitive types to objects, e.g.
        Integer(3) is a wrapper that constructs an Integer object
       from the integer 3. This is useful as some generic functions
      require objects. For example Vector() is a container of objects,
     not of primitive types.
  </ul>
<h3> What you should be absolutely sure of </h3>
  <ul>
   <li> How to <b>define </b> and <b> access </b>
     <ul>
      <li> classes
      <li> objects
      <li> class or static methods
     <li> object methods
     <li> class or static variables
     <li> object variables
    </ul>
  </ul>
