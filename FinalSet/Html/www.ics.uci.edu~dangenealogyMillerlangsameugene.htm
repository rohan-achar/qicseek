Dear Moishe,
I looked through your website. A ganze Megilla. Too much to read. I srolled
through it
and couldn't find Langsam. Maybe I went too fast.
(This is the second letter, the first one disappeared all of a sudden while
writing)
Anyway I'll give you what I have. Do you have anything with the familyname
Bier?
I think most of it is from Germany and it starts this way:


Jitschok Bier, about 1685
One of his children Shimshon Jitschok Bier
One of his children David Simon Bier 1747-1823
One of his children  Jacob David Bier
One of his childdren Jacob Cossman Bier. Married Susanna Isac.
Some of their children 1 David
                                  2 Isaak
                                  3 Rebecca bier married August Warendorf;
                                    They had a daughter Sophie Warendorf who
married a ? Langsam'
They had a son Eugene (or a daughter Eugenie?) because it is not clear if he
married a Carla
Heimann (or she married a Carl Heiman. The trail is dead.


I am a descendant of  Jacob David Bier.
One of his children was  Sophie Bier who married Jonas Fassbender.
One of their children was Eva Fassbender who married Abraham Meyerhof, my
grandmother
Rosalie's parents.
Rosalie married Hermann Randerath. They had 4 children. One of them was
Lotte.
She married my father Henri van Collem from Holland. (Sounds goyish but a
very good
Dutch Jewish name.
I am one of Henri and Lotte's children. My dad was murdered in Bergen
Belsen. My mom died
7 years ago at the age of 93. She my sister (in Israel) and I made it alive
out of Bergen Belsen.
Sorry not to be able to give you anything more.
I got some of my information from James Steckerl, the son of a cousin of my
mother who lives in England.
If you are at all interested, let me know and I give you his e-mail.


All the best, Ilse Zilversmit-nee van Collem.

Hi,
I know that it has been a while, but can I take you up on your offer? Do you 
think that your cousin in England, can be of any more help in the Langsam 
Connection? 

Can you date  Sophie Warendorf? When about was she born and/or married?

Dear Moishe,
 
If you can IMMEDIATELY refresh my memory I'll see what I can do. I am leaving on
Tuesday the 17th for London if that is the cousin you are talking about. So you 
have just a day or two and I am very busy. So be quick s.v.p. Ilse
