<h2>How do I create a new table?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Double-click the tabulizer application, or type cmd-N within
tabulizer, to create a table. The default column headings are
probably not what you want to use, so click the "Edit Columns"
button (cmd-/ for short) to display the components for changing the
number and names of the columns (screenshot below).</p>

<p>You can double-click on any column name in the drawer and type a
new name for the column. The tab key moves from one column name to
the next. The two buttons allow you to create a new column (on the
right side of the table) or get rid of the rightmost column. When
you are done editing the columns, click the button or press cmd-/
again to hide the drawer.</p>

<h2>How do I add data to my table?</h2>

<blockquote>To add a new row to your table, simply press return.
You can then start typing into the cells of the row, moving from
one cell to the next by the tab key. You can also go back and edit
any of your old data by double clicking on it and using the
standard Mac OS editing commands. When you are done adding data,
use the Save command (cmd-S) to store your table to a
file.</blockquote>

<h2>My table is in the wrong order. How can I rearrange it?</h2>

<blockquote>Clicking on any column header will sort the rows of the
table by the values in that column. Clicking again on the same
header will toggle between ascending and descending sorted order.
If you wish to rearrange the rows in some unsorted order, 
you can select some rows, and cut them and paste them into the desired
position.
You can also rearrange the columns by clicking and dragging them,
and change the widths of the columns by dragging the boundaries
between the column headers.
</blockquote>

<h2>My table is too big to scan by eye.  How can I find the rows I want?</h2>

<blockquote>
If you remember some text which occurs in the row, you can use the Find
command (keyboard shortcut command-F).  This will open a dialog which
will ask you for some text to search for, and where to look for that
text in each row.  By default, it will find the first matching line in
the whole table, but there are options for other search patterns such as
starting from the currently selected line and finding the next match.
Once you have already done a search, you can use the
command-G (search again forwards) and command-D (search again backwards)
commands to move around to other matching lines.
</blockquote>

<h2>How can I move my data to or from another program?</h2>

<blockquote>
The easiest way to exchange data with another program
is by copy and paste.  Tabulizer's copy and paste operations
can handle data in a Mac-standard tab-separated value format; we expect
this to work with other spreadsheet programs, but have not yet tested this.
In addition, tabulizer can also copy its tables into plain text strings
(suitable for pasting into text editors such as BBEdit), and
HTML-formatted tables (suitable for pasting into TextEdit; note,
however, that TextEdit lacks the ability to edit or format such tables
once they are pasted).
Tabulizer's data files are in standard XML format,
which can be read by many browsers and XML editors, but can not
likely be read by spreadsheets or text editors.
We intend to add options to tabulizer's routines for reading
and saving files, to handle standard spreadsheet formats such as
csv or tsv, but this is not possible yet.
</blockquote>

<h2>I made a mistake. How can I fix it?</h2>

<blockquote>All operations that change the table can be undone by
the Undo command (cmd-Z). Continued use of Undo will back up
through the history of operations until the most recent file open
or new table command. To perform an undone operation again, use
Redo (cmd-shift-Z). You can also use the Revert command to return
to the most recently saved version of the file.</blockquote>
