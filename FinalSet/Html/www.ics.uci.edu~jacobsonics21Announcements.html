<p>Retake sessions during finals week are

<p>Monday 2, 3, 4, 5  pm</p>
<p>Tuesday 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 pm</p>
<p>Wednesday 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pm</p>

<p>All session are in ICS 183.</p>

Each session starts on the
hour given, and lasts for 50
minutes.

<p>You may take up to one
retake for each exam
during a session; for
instance, you can retake
Lab 1 and Lab 2 once
each during the same session,
but you cannot make two
attempts at Lab 3 during the
same session.</p>

<p>Please do not turn in an
exam you know you will
not pass; it just slows down
our grading, without
providing any new information to you. Please be
very careful to label your
exam project folder
correctly, to include
in the exam's files your
name and ID where
indicated, and to turn
in the exam to the
correct dropbox: we
cannot grade what we
do not have or cannot
find!</p>

<p>We will grade tests as quickly
as we can, given our resources.
If you are worried whether you
passed a test, and are worried
that the grade may not be posted
in time for you to retake it again
if you need to, take the test
again, even though your previous
grade is not yet posted: if you
pass a retake, we do not grade
any subsequent retakes for
that test, so retaking an 'extra'
test will not hurt your grade. </p>
