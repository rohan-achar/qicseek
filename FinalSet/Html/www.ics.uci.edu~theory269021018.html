Title: Algorithms for Fault-Tolerant Routing in Circuit Switched Networks
<br>
Speaker: Amitabha Bagchi</h2>

Abstract:
We consider the <I>k</I> edge-disjoint paths problem
(<I>k</I>-EDP), a generalization of the well known edge-disjoint paths
problem. Given a graph <I>G</I>=(<I>V,E</I>) and a set of terminal pairs (or
requests) <I>T</I>, the problem is to find a maximum subset of the pairs in
<I>T</I> for which it is possible to select paths such that each pair is
connected by <I>k</I> edge-disjoint paths and the paths for different pairs
are mutually disjoint.  To the best of our knowledge, no nontrivial
result is known for this problem for <I>k</I>&gt;1. To measure the performance
of our algorithms we use the recently introduced flow number <I>F</I> of a
graph. This parameter is known to fulfill <I>F=O</I>(<I>Delta alpha</I><sup>-1</sup> log
<I>n</I>), where <I>Delta</I> is the maximum degree and <I>alpha</I> is the edge
expansion of <I>G</I>. We show that a simple, greedy online algorithm
achieves a competitive ratio of <I>O</I>(<I>k</I><sup>3</sup> <I>F</I>), which naturally
extends the best known bound of <I>O</I>(<I>F</I>) for <I>k</I>=1 to higher <I>k</I>.  To
achieve this competitive ratio, we introduce a new method of
converting a system of <I>k</I> disjoint paths into a system of <I>k</I>
length-bounded disjoint paths.
<P>
In addition, we study the <I>k disjoint flows problem</I> (<I>k</I>-DFP),
which is a generalization of the previously studied unsplittable flow
problem (UFP). The difference between the <I>k</I>-DFP and the <I>k</I>-EDP is
that now we consider a graph with edge capacities and our requests are
allowed to have arbitrary demands <I>d<sub>i</sub></I>. The aim is to find a subset
of requests of maximum total demand for which it is possible to select
flow paths such that all the capacity constraints are maintained and
each selected request with demand <I>d<sub>i</sub></I> is connected by <I>k</I> disjoint
paths, each of flow value <I>d<sub>i</sub>/k</I>.

This talk is based on work done jointly with Amitabh Chaudhary,
Christian Scheideler and Petr Kolman.
