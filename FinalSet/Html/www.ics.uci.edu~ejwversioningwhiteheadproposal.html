<P>
<B>1.  Introduction</B>
<P>
<B>1.1  Purpose<BR>
</B>
<P>
The World-Wide Web has demonstrated great utility as a mechanism
for allowing information entities to be published, then browsed
by the global Internet community. However, the current publish/browse
model only allows browsing of the most current revision of an
entity; older versions of an entity become unaccessible after
it is updated. The HTTP/1.1 specification extends the publish/browse
model by allowing distributed <I>editing</I> of entities, affording
use of the World-Wide Web for distributed home editing of personal
web pages, tele-commuting, and distributed software development,
among others.  As defined in HTTP/1.1, the &quot;PUT&quot; method
overwrites the current contents of the destination Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) or Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  This allows
users to overwrite each other's editing updates with successive
PUT method invocations (the &quot;lost update&quot; problem),
an unacceptable outcome during group work. <BR>

<P>
Versioning techniques alleviate both the loss of past revisions
of an entity and the lost update problem.  Fundamental to all
versioning approaches is the provision of storage for past states
of a entitiy and methods for the retrieval of those past states;
together, they preserve the history of an entity for later examination
or use.  Versioning addresses the lost update problem by providing
a policy for the creation, locking, and editing of a new state
of an entity.  <BR>

<P>
This document describes a set of extensions to the World-Wide
Web which augment it with versioning capability.  Included in
this document are extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol to add methods
specific to versioning, new entity types to describe collections
of versioned entities and derivation relationships between versions
of the same entity, and URI/URL naming conventions for versioned
entities.
<P>
<B>1.2  Desired Capabilites<BR>
</B>
<P>
The capabilities desired of versioning support for the World-Wide
Web are:
<UL>
<LI><I>Policy-neutral versioning</I>: the methods defined for
accessing, modifing, and locking entities should allow multiple
versioning policies to be built on top of them.  For example,
lock-based policies, as employed by RCS, and merge-based policies,
as implemented in CVS, should both be implementable.
<LI><I>Retrieval of a stated version of an entity</I>: Any given
revision of an entity should be accessible, thus supporting links
to stated revisions of entities.
<LI><I>Writing to a given version of an entity</I>: Once changes
have been made to an entity, versioning policies often dictate
that the changes be written into a new, stated version of that
entity.
<LI><I>Parallel development support</I>: Since it frequently occurs
that multiple people edit the same entity simultaneously, this
type of activity must be supported.  User agents must be supplied
with enough information to inform their users when they are entering
a parallel development situation, and they must be supplied with
the versions of parallel entities so they can provide merge support
for the entity contents.  Futhermore, since it is currently beyond
the state of the art to provide merge support for certain entity
types (e.g., MPEG video), it must be possible to disallow parallel
development on these entity types.
<LI><I>Browsing within a collection of entities</I>: Often multiple
entities together form a logical grouping, for example, a collection
of HTML and GIF entities which comprise online documentation for
a software product.  It is desirable to provide support for browsing
within such a collection without requiring either the user or
the entities to explicitly name the destination entity version
of each link traversal.
<LI><I>Retrieval of derivation relationships between versions
of an entity</I>: The ability to trace the development and ownership
of an entity provides visibility into the development of that
entity, and is frequently useful to the user.
<LI><I>Visibility control</I>: Through the user agent, it should
be possible to control the external visibility of an entity. 
For example, this is useful  for ensuring that working revisions
of an entity are not accessible by the entire world.

<P>
<B>1.3 Types of Group Work Supported<BR>
</B>
<P>
Single, Parallel Asynchronous, not Parallel Synchronous
<P>
<B>2.0 Version Naming Conventions<BR>
</B>
<P>
A version of a URI is explicitly specified by appending a parameter
called &quot;v&quot; to the URI.  For example, version 3.0 of
entity foo would be written foo;v=3.0.
<P>
<B>3.0 Extensions to HTTP/1.1<BR>
</B>
<P>
(Note: IETF standard BNF is not consistently used throughout ...
needs some cleanup)
<P>
<B>3.1 New Methods<BR>
</B>
<P>
The new methods added to HTTP/1.1 to support versioning are:<BR>

<P>
&quot;FLAG&quot;
<P>
&quot;LOCK&quot;
<P>
&quot;UNLOCK&quot;
<P>
&quot;USE&quot;
<P>
<B>3.2 FLAG<BR>
</B>
<P>
The FLAG method operates on flags associated with the Request-URI.
 FLAG makes use of a new Request Header Field called &quot;Flag-Option&quot;.
 Valid values of Flag-Option are &quot;SET&quot; flag, &quot;CLEAR&quot;
flag, and &quot;QUERY&quot;.  The FLAG method must be accompanied
by a valid &quot;Authorization&quot; header field (ed: or the
appropriate header field for identifying the end-user operating
the user-agent to the HTTP server).  The FLAG method always has
an entity-body which contains a list of the active flags for the
entity (including the effects of the requested Flag-Option), in
the form:<BR>
<BR>

<P>
For all users with flags set:
<P>
{user identification string}: {list of flags currently set for
the user}
<P>
<B>3.2.1 Flag-Option values<BR>
</B>
<P>
The &quot;SET&quot; Flag-Option sets the indicated flag to true.
 The &quot;CLEAR&quot; Flag-Option sets the indicated flag to
false.  The &quot;QUERY&quot; Flag-Option has no effect on any
flag (and hence only causes the return of the current list of
flags).  A flag set on an entity (no version specified in the
Request-URI) applies to all versions of that entity.  A flag set
on a particular version of an entity (version specified in Request-URI)
applies to only the indicated version of the entity.<BR>

<P>
When the Flag-Option is &quot;SET&quot;, the indicated flag will
be set, then automatically cleared after one week, unless the
&quot;Auto-Timeout&quot; header is present, in which case the
value it specifies will be employed.  An Auto-Timeout value of
&quot;Never&quot; causes the flag to never automatically be cleared
after a preset interval. Re-setting the same flag on the Request-URI
is legal, and causes the timeout value to be updated.
<P>
<B>3.2.2 Flag Naming Conventions<BR>
</B>
<P>
There are two flags with special names for the versioning context,
these being:<BR>

<P>
&quot;EDIT&quot;
<P>
&quot;LOCK&quot;<BR>

<P>
The EDIT flag is for use by CVS-like versioning policies, and
has the meaning: this entity is currently being edited by the
named user.  The LOCK flag is automatically set by the LOCK method,
and indicates that the entity is locked.  User-agents should not
use other flags to duplicate the meaning of the EDIT and LOCK
flags.
<P>
<B>3.3 LOCK<BR>
</B>
<P>
The &quot;LOCK&quot; method causes the Request-URI to have the
&quot;PUT&quot; method denied for all users except the user requesting
the lock.  This method must be accompanied by a valid &quot;Authorization&quot;
header field.  If the Request-URI specifically names a version,
then the lock applies only to that version.  If the Request-URI
does not name a version, then the lock applies to all versions.
 If a &quot;LOCK&quot; is attempted on all versions of the Request-URI
and there is currently a lock on an individual version of the
Request-URI held by another user, a response with status code
409 Conflict will be returned, with an entity body which states
that the Request-URI is already locked by another user(s), and
naming the other user(s). In the event a &quot;PUT&quot; is attempted
on a locked entity, a response with status code 409 Conflict will
be returned, with an entity body which states the Request-URI
is locked.<BR>

<P>
The &quot;LOCK&quot; method also causes the &quot;LOCK&quot; flag
to be set on the Request-URI, however, the currently set flags
are not returned in the entity-body.<BR>

<P>
When a LOCK is set, it will automatically be reset after one week,
unless the &quot;Auto-Timeout&quot; header is present, in which
case the value it specifies will be employed.  An Auto-Timeout
value of &quot;Never&quot; causes the lock to never automatically
be reset after a predetermined interval.  Re-locking the same
Request-URI is legal, and causes the timeout value to be updated.
<BR>

<P>
The LOCK method may also employ the new &quot;If-Not-Modified-Since&quot;
header field to specify that the lock will occur only if the entity
has not been modified since the time specified in this field.
 This ensures that a user does not take out a lock on an entity
which has changes since they retrieved it.  Typically, the time
specified in the &quot;If-Not-Modified-Since&quot; field is the
time of the most recent retrieval of the entity being locked.
<P>
<B>3.4 UNLOCK</B>
<P>
The &quot;UNLOCK&quot; method releases an existing lock, and clears
the LOCK flag on the Request-URI, and must be accompanied by a
valid &quot;Authorization&quot; field.  If the Request-URI does
not have a lock set by the requesting user, or if there is a lock
currently held by another user, a response with status code 409
Conflict will be returned, with an entity body which explains
the cause of the conflict.
<P>
<B>3.5 USE<BR>
</B>
<P>
The &quot;USE&quot; method causes the server to always employ
the specified version of the Request-URI when the Request-URI
is employed in a method without stating an explicit version. 
This method allows a preferred version of an entity to be returned
by the server in response to a GET or HEAD method.   It also allows
the version of a directory (container entity) to be prespecified
for all methods.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.0 Configurations<BR>
</B>
<P>
Browsing within a collection of entities (such as an older version
of program documentation) may be accomplished using a configuration
file.  A configuration file contains a list of URI's (without
a version explicitly specified), and a corresponding URI with
the version specified.  The configuration file is used by the
user-agent as a filter: if a GET or HEAD method call is made against
one of the URI's without the version explicitly specified from
the active configuration file, the user-agent will substitute
the URI with the version explicitly stated. The configuration
file also contains an entry point designator, which specifies
a member of the configuration to be loaded after the configuration
itself has finished loading (this is analogous to loading a description
of a book, then loading the contents of the first chapter for
display).<BR>

<P>
Navigation within a configuration starts when the user-agent loads
a configuration file (MIME type: text/config) -- the user agent
parses the file, determines the entry point URI, performs a GET
on it, then immediately starts using the configuration as a filter
until the next configuration file is loaded, at which point only
the new configuration is active.
<P>
<B>4.1 Description of text/config type<BR>
</B>
<P>
The text/config (configuration file) type is just a simple mapping
between URI's.  This basic wrapping information has been augmented
with HTML formatting codes so that the file can be displayed by
a user-agent which does understand the text/config type.  This
allows limited browsing capability by using the configuration
file as a menu.<BR>

<P>
ConfigFile = HTML-DTD
<P>
  HTML-Head
<P>
  Config-Banner
<P>
  Config-Entry-Point
<P>
  *(Config-Item)
<P>
  HTML-End<BR>

<P>
The detailed BNF elaboration is TBD.<BR>

<P>
An example configuration file is:</P>

<CODE>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;&gt;
<BR>

<P>
&lt;HEAD&gt;
<P>
&lt;TITLE&gt;Configuration File: <I>name of configuration file</I>&lt;/TITLE&gt;

<P>
Appendix A contains a description of an example use of the methods
described in this document for implementing the CVS-style of versioning
(merge-based).<BR>

<P>
The user starts by browsing through a series of pages.  Eventually
they find one they want to begin editing.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2>

<TR>

<TD>GET <I>entity</I> </TD><TD><P>Retrieves contents of page to be modified.</P></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>FLAG <I>entity</I> (Flag-Option: SET EDIT) </TD><TD>
Notifies server that editing is taking place.
The user agent receives back a list of flags already set on this
entity, and notifies the user that they are entering a parallel
work situation if the EDIT flag is already set. If the LOCK
flag is set, the user is informed of the LOCK (and they may
optionally proceed at their own risk, knowing they have 
to coordinate the release of the lock before they can save
their changes).</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The user now enters an &quot;edit-save-check&quot; cycle where
they perform their work, save it, then check that it actually
looks correct using a browser.  There are several possibilities
for where this work can be saved.  One option is to the user's
local disk.  Another is to perform a PUT to a scratchpad area
on the HTTP server.</P>

<P>
In the case the user decides to stop editing, the user-agent sends
a FLAG entity (Flag-Option: CLEAR EDIT), and performs a DELETE
of all working copies on the server.</P>

<P>
When the user has finished editing and wants to do a final save
of their changes, the user agent performs a:</P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2>

<TR>
<TD>
PUT <I>new-entity-version</I> </TD><TD><P>Save the contents to the server
</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>FLAG <I>entity </I> (Flag-Option: CLEAR EDIT)</TD><TD>
<P>Inform the server that this user is not performing any more editing.
The user-agent checks the flag settings on this entity to see
if merging is necessary. (Ed: I think we may need to look at derivation
information to fully determine if merging is necessary.)</P></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Perform merge, if needed.</P>

<TR>
<TD>FLAG <I>entity</I> (Flag-Option: QUERY) </TD>
<TD>Retrieve all flags currently set on the entity.
This allows the user-agent to check for other users editing
this entity using non-locking styles, and for the existence of
active locks on the entity.</TD>
</TABLE>

<P>
Assuming there are no locks, or flags set...</P>

<P>
LOCK <I>entity</I>  (If-Not-Mofified-Since: <I>time of GET of

<P>
Assuming the lock was successful, the user now begins an edit-save-check
cycle.</P>

<P>
If they decide to abort their work, the user-agent issues an UNLOCK
<I>entity</I>, and a DELETE of all working copies stored on the
HTTP server.</P>

<P>
If the user decides to perform their final save:</P>
