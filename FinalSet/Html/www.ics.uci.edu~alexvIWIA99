<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This invited workshop aims to bring together researchers and designers
from academia and industry to discuss directions in the development
of high-performance, parallel, distributed, and multimedia processors and
systems.  The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler,
operating system, and application experts. The main goal of the workshop
is to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and
software systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects  
about software systems and by software writers about architecture.
The increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased
interaction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately
assess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems.
</p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The main themes of the workshop are application requirements and
characteristics, compiler/architecture interaction and codesign, and software-
and technology-driven and constrained new architectures. Numerical
and non-numerical applications, in particular database, data mining,
Web- and Java-based applications, are of interest.  
In all cases a longer-term view
and assessment of the future is of most interest.
</p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This year we will concentrate on computation and memory
intensive applications, i.e. applications requiring more CPU power,
more memory bandwidth and lower memory latency than present or projected systems
can provide.  Workshop topics of  interest will deal with this type of
applications and include but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Application characteristics
<li> Their requirements and impact on system architecture and compilation
<li> Approaches to better map applications/algorithms to systems with traditional
   architecture, memory hierarchy
<li> Application community's view of whether the architectural limitations are fundamental
   or can be overcome by the use of different/new algorithms
<li> New architectural approaches to application problems as perceived by architects
<li> Modeling, benchmarking, and performance evaluation of such applications  
</ul>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Additional workshop areas of interest include the perennial favorites below,
but preference will be given to submissions on the above-mentioned topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Clusters, SAN, and FibreChannel-based systems <br>
<li> PC-based parallel computing <br>
<li> Single-chip multiprocessors, multi-chip servers and large-scale multiprocessors <br>
<li> Memory technology and system organization <br>
<li> Systems On a Chip (SOC) <br>
<li> Java-based computing <br>
</ul>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations 
with discussion.  Presentations will be limited to 15 min to provide sufficient
time for discussion.  An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future
directions rather than recently obtained results.  Speculation is encouraged.
</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<b> Workshop participation is capped at 50 invitees.  <br>
RSVP by Sept.30th, 1999
if you plan to attend. </b>

<b> Submission and Publication </b> </center>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   An extended abstract, up to 3 pages, should be submitted by 10/10/99.
   Submissions should electronic and in postscript  or pdf format.
   Papers will be refereed on the basis of the extended abstract and
   accepted for either regular or short presentation.  Authors will be
   notified about paper acceptance by Oct. 21, 1999.  
</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Full papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting.
The full papers will undergo an additional review process.
The following set of LaTex <A HREF="../ieee.macros">  macros </A> should be used
in preparing the paper.
Additional publication instructions will be made available at a later date.

<li>
There are some non-stop flights from the mainland to Maui  Kahului airport and
even more flights to Honolulu.  In the latter case one has to catch a very short
commuter flight from Honolulu to Maui.   <br>
See maps and directions below for
airport, Prince hotel, and MHPCC locations.
<br>
<li>
Registration fee: US$100.00 to cover publication costs and some of
the local expenses.
<br>
<li>
Car rental is recommended to drive to/from the airport, MHPCC meeting room,
and the hotel.  Car pooling will also be possible.
<br>
<li>
The workshop hotel is the <b> Maui Prince </b> where we have a special rate contract ($130). Reservations have to be made by 10/15 and will require a 2 night deposit (can be cancelled without penalty up to a week before arrival).  Phone number for reservations is <b> (800)-321-6248 </b>.
<br>
It is possible to stay a few extra days at the same rate before and after the
meeting.
<br>
A number of condominiums (1 to 3 bedroom) will be available for those
preferring apartment living. Their price is similar.
