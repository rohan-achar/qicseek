<h1>Algorithm Designers</h1>

This file lists names and (sometimes) home pages of algorithm
designers whose algorithms were discussed in the lectures. 

<ul>
<li><a name="blum"><a href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~blum/">
Manuel Blum</a></a> is a professor at U.C. Berkeley. He was one of
the inventors of the <a href="960130.html">deterministic linear
time selection algorithm</a>. He won the Turing award, the ACM's
highest honor, in 1995. His most recent research has been on
methods for automatically checking the correctness of programs.

<li><a name="boruvka">O. Boruvka</a>. <a href=
"960206.html#boruvka">Boruvka's algorithm</a> is one of three
classical minimum-spanning tree algorithms.

"http://www.cli.com/staff/resumes/boyer/index.html">Robert Stephen
Boyer</a></a> now works with J. S. Moore on automatic theorem
proving programs at U. Texas, Austin. The <a href=
"960222.html#match">Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm</a> is
described in Baase, but I didn't say much about it in lecture.

received a Ph.D., although his many accomplishments would easily
have been enough to earn one. He won the Turing award, the ACM's
highest honor, in 1978. He was one of the inventors of the <a href= 
"960130.html">deterministic linear time selection algorithm</a>. He
also made early improvements in <a href="960118.html#quicksort">

most famous for inventing the TeX and Metafont typesetting systems,
and for writing "The Art of Computer Programming", a multi-volume
compendium on algorithms that is still worth reading (even though
much of it was written in the 1960's). He won the Turing award, the
ACM's highest honor, in 1974. Knuth was one of the inventors of the
