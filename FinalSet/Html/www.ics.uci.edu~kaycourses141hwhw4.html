<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This shorter-than-usual assignment is due
on Monday, February 14, by 7:00 p.m. in the locking box in CS 189.  Turn
in everything you have completed at that time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B>  In this assignment you will
explore data types and expressions.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Readings and review questions:</B>  This
assignment covers most of Sebesta, chapters 5 and 6.  You should know the
answers to the review questions listed below, but you do not have to turn
them in.  This list should help you identify some of the more important
concepts in the text.  (On the other hand, don&#39;t infer that the topics
we skip or omit are entirely <I>un</I>important.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Chapter 5:  1-8, 13, 14, 17-19, 22, 24, 26-32</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Chapter 6:  1-5, 7-12, 14-16</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  In the Sebesta text, do problems
1 and 2 in the problem set starting on page 255.  For Problem 2, he&#39;s
referring to storing each decimal digit separately in memory, rather than
representing the entire decimal value in binary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>It&#39;s a good idea to think about the comparisons
that other problems in this chapter address, even though we&#39;re not assigning
them.</FONT></P>
