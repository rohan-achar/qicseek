Select and evaluate algorithms for camera control that will allow  smooth, predictive control of the camera given various scenarios of subject  movement.</p><h3><br>  <a name="Two"></a>Raytheon Visualization Interface for Enhanced Analysis. </h3><p>Re-engineer an existing analysis component coded in Ada83 using OO design  and the C++ language. The existing analysis component produces numeric output  in a tabular form. Design and implement a visualization interface (e.g., using  browser-based thin-client) to enhance analysts' understanding of results.</p><h3><br>  <a name="Three"></a>Raytheon C++/Java Message Interoperability Tool. </h3><p>Develop a tool that will accept a description of a message interface definition  via some defined Interface Description Language (IDL). The tool generates the<br>  corresponding C++ and Java classes to enable interoperability at the message  level between C++ and Java programs, including the logic for constructing the  actual messages that will be transmitted. This tool facilitates synchronization  between the two sides of the interface based on a simple interface definition.  The generated code should be portable and not dependent on any outside class  libraries, including CORBA libraries. The tool should be designed so that the  mapping from the IDL to the corresponding C++ and Java constructs is changeable  without modification  to the core of the tool.<br></p><h3><a name="Four"></a>Raytheon Multilingual User Interface.</h3><p> Enhance existing English-language user interface components, currently implemented  in Java/Swing, to allow real-time user selection of one of multiple languages  (including bi-directional support    for Arabic). Identify enhancements to the XML display description/data  mapping for these components in order to support multiple  languages. Evaluate services APIs to identify changes required to support multiple  languages. Implement prototype and evaluate display performance.<br></p><h3><a name="Five"></a>Raytheon On-line Content Management System. </h3><p>Identify candidate products and            tools for implementation of a web-based content management system.  The system will normalize user access to data sets hosted on a set of  diverse platforms and database products; facilitate user ability to supply  content; improve user  access to and awareness of available content through index and  search capabilities; and provide user and role-based access controls.  Implement  and evaluate a prototype system based on the selected products  and tools.</p><h3><br>  <a name="Six"></a>Raytheon Web Services Implementation. </h3><p>Take set of existing tabular display components implemented in a J2EE framework  and re-implement using web services technologies.

Evaluate and select appropriate Java technology for implementation  (e.g., JSP, servlets).  Document the design  patterns applied to achieve the implementation.</p><h3><a name="Seven"></a>UCI: The Web as Middleware</h3><p><br>  Middleware is software that allows the interconnection of potentially heterogeneous    software components across process and network boundaries. Two of the most    prevalent 'flavors' of middleware are Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Message-Oriented    Middleware (MOM). RPC is traditionally used for synchronous communication    between system components, while MOM supports asynchronous messaging. Each    of these types of middleware has advantages and disadvantages that make the    selection of one over the other a system-dependent process and each of them    have a variety of different competing implementations. The focus of this    project lies with middleware for component-based systems communicating using    asynchronous events; C2 architectures are an example of this class of system.<br>  Distributed event-based systems require a middleware communication mechanism  in order to transmit events from one part of the system to another. Given the  inherent event-based nature of such systems, MOM seems to be the most appropriate  selection. But, the use of one of the available 'industrial strength' middleware  solutions featuring similar functionality yet disparate implementations is  not necessarily the only approach. The Web is also a platform that can be used  as a simple but powerful middleware solution. Using the Web as a form of middleware  is not an entirely new idea: [1] discusses the possibilities of using the Common  Gateway Interface (CGI) as middleware between users and underlying applications,  while [2] presents an approach to mobile computing where applications are madeavailable ubiquitously using the Web as middlware. </p><p>In this project, students will implement a Web-based middleware solution for  C2 architectures; this will be a prototype implementation and a feasibility    study which examines the reality of using the Web as a MOM solution: web    servers will be used as the connectors which both send and receive asynchronous  messages in order to construct highly distributed event-basedsystems.</p><p>There are several advantages to using web servers as middleware connectors.  First, their simplicity &#710; compared to some middlware implementations,  web servers can be rather lightweight and simple to implement and maintain.  But, most importantly, web servers have the potential of providing  useful capabilities for a low cost: the ability of a web server  to arbitrarily manage its namespace, augment it with new information,  and present it to Web browsers can provide a very high level of visibility  into the operation of the middleware connector. For example, such  a connector can easily maintain a log of all messages received and sent  including  information about failures. Or, the URLs to which a particular  web server connector links to can be presented to users and dynamically  changed through HTML forms to easily implement a small measure  of dynamic system adaptation. Leveraging web connectors in this manner and  integrating them into an architecture-based approach to system developmentis, as far as I'm aware, a novel contribution.</p> Features and Criteria for Success <ul>  <li> A xADL 2.0 schema extension defining a C2 Web Connector.    This schema should make the URLs the connector links to and the types of    messages they transmit to each explicit.</li>  <li>A C2 connector wrapping around a lightweight, OTS web server. Students     must define and implement a clear interface encapsulating the    interaction of the C2 Connector with the web server &#710; this way, other  OTS servers can be used with less effort.  <ul>  <li>These connectors need to base their transmission behavior on the  architectural description, and update their behavior in response to the  description changing.</li>  <li>- These connectors must keep a log of all events received and transmitted.  </li></ul>   <li>A two-way translation from C2 events to an XML-based playload to be transmitted      over HTTP &#710; and vice versa.<br>    - This must be a seperate C2 component, which then tranmits the payload to    the Web Connector for transmission.<br>   </li>	<li>Web front-end to C2 Web Connectors.<br>    - Users must be able to access the URL of the Web Connector and be provided      HTML pages which provide access to the following information (at least):<br>    - HTML formatted infromation from the C2&lt;-&gt;XML translator.<br>    - Logs of messages sent/received and errors.<br>    - The list of URLs the connector transmits to.<br>    - This list needs to be changeable (hint: use forms to gather input, modify    the architectural model, and update the inner workings accordingly).<br>	</li>    <li>These components and connectors must be integrated into the C2/Archstudio      infrastructure for...<br>    </li>    <li>A demonstration of C2 Web Connectors using an existing C2 demonstration.<br>    - Students must distribute a previously non-distributed system to at least      three different network locations, and demonstrate its use. KLAX, or even      Archstudio itself could be used for this.<br>    </li>   <li> (Time permitting) Security for point-to-point connections.<br>    - Certificates? Students can explore this space on their own, and suggest    solutions.</li></li>   <br>   </li>  </ul> <p>Students working on this project will be exposed and acquire valuable experience  in the practical use of software architectures and accompanying research technologies  (C2, ArchStudio, c2.fw) as well as a collection of    popular andmarketable Web technologies (HTTP, HTML, XML, XSD, XSLT). </p><p>Should they decide to pursue the security problem, they'll also acquire even  more marketable skills. Background preparation will also expose students torelevant research literature.</p><p>References<br>  [1] Faughnan, J.G. &#8222;Client-Server Computing: The Web as Middleware&#8240;,URL:<br>http://www.faughnan.com/papers/clservweb.html<br>[2] Vuong, S.T.

However, the Web is primarily a reading/browsing  medium,  rather than a writing medium. A Web document compiler is envisioned as an application  that allows a user to &quot;cut&quot; selected contents from a Web page (text,  images, embedded hyperlinks, mp3 files, etc.) and then &quot;paste&quot; the  selected content into a new document/Web page, that captures the selected content,  as well as the URL from where it was selected, information (anchors? tags?)  to indicate where the selected content begins and ends, and a timestamp when  it was cut-and-pasted as a way to maintain a relation to the source of the  document components. The composed document can also include new content entered/edited  by the user. The resulting document composition record (or &quot;build&quot; script)  might then function like a &quot;make&quot; file, allowing the user to rebuild  the composed document from its sources at a later time/place. This might allow  the user to then observe which document components have changed since a previous  compilation. Such a capability might then allow the user to also share their  document compilation scripts with their friends so that others could compile  the same document components, or compose new documents or modified versionsof shared documents, when using the Web document compiler/composition system.</p><p class=CheckThis>What do they really need to do? Build a simple compile/build  utility that processes an explicit representation of a multi-part or multi-component      document to produce  a compiled document.</p><p class=CheckThis>What makes this project challenging? Users can already manually  compose a new document by selecting and cut-and-paste existing document contents.      This is      often not a repeatable or shareable technique, nor does it allow for new      versions of the composed document to be compiled/built on demand, given      that the source  content may have changed since the previous document build.</p><p class=CheckThis>What makes it worth doing?<br>  More and more people want to create and shared Web-based documents whose        contents can be updated automaticaly, rather than manually. For instance,        if I want        to create a selection of sharable mp3/text files that can be burned on        a CD, then share my selection with a friend who wants most of the same        mp3/text        files,        but wants to add/remove one or more files, then it would be nice to have        easy way for sharing composable document scripts, rather than just sharing        the raw  mp3/text files.</p><p class=CheckThis>&nbsp;</p><h3 class=CheckThis><a name="Scacchi3"></a>Scacchi: Virtual Interactive Development Environment for CSEducation</h3><p class=CheckThis> What is it? An Interactive Development  Environment is usually an integrated collection of services, utilities, or  tools that      can be used to support the development of software application systems/programs.    Java-based IDEs like Visual Cafe, BlueJ for Java, and Rational Rose are large    commercial products, while NetBeans (from netbeans.org) and Eclipse (eclipse.org)    are free, open source IDEs implemented in Java, supporting the development    of Java applications. However, there are many other (open source) software    tools/utilities that may be useful for developing certain kinds of application    systems (e.g., database management systems, expert system shells, computer    graphics libraries, user interface development kits, computer-aided software    design, computer game engines, etc.). Furthermore, it now appears that it      should    be possible to find and collect dozens of open source tools, where one or      more tools might be of use in different CS undergraduate courses. </p><p class=CheckThis>What do they really need to do? Find and collect a bunch of  open source tools. The tools may reside and operate on remote network servers,  rather than on  each user's computer.</p><p class=CheckThis>Build a user interface that presents a end-user/student with  grouped sub-sets of tools associated with different CS course types (e.g.,  for a course in database  management, tools like MySQL, PostgreSQL, BerkeleyDB, and SAP-DB might be grouped,  together with tools for Java-SQL (or JODBC) dbms program development). In a  Virtual IDE, tool integration need only be realized at the user interface level,  (i.e., an &quot;integrated collection&quot;) rather than integrated via coding  at the API or middleware level as would be necessary in a conventional IDE.  So low-level systems programming may be avoided, since this is mostly a user  interface level, virtual IDE.</p><p class=CheckThis><br>  What makes this project challenging? Supporting tools that execute on remote    servers. Managing the transfer of tool input/output between user-clients      and remote servers. Moving tool input/output in/out of distributed repositories/file    servers.
