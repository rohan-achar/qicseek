<H2>Distributed Web Content Authoring Tools</H2>

<P>This page captures information on several early distributed Web
content authoring tools. These tools had some influence on the first
several years of deliberations of the WebDAV working group. The list
also demonstrated knowledge of existing authoring tools by leaders
and members of the working group.</P>

<P>This list is no longer actively maintained, and many links are
unlikely to work. You may wish to try the <A

The America Online PrimeHost hosting service, formerly known as the
GNN Hosting Service, which in turn was formerly known as NaviSoft,
provides a service for using their AOLpress software to publish web
pages on their server for a monthly fee.  Since you can currently
<A HREF="http://www.aolpress.com/download.html">download
fully-functional</A>, but non-supported versions of their AOLpress and
AOLserver tools, it is also possible to experiment with these
tools.</P>

<P>AOLpress employs the PUT method to write content to the AOLserver,
which implements access control features which control, among other
methods, who can PUT to particular namespaces within the server.  The
<A HREF="http://www.aolserver.com/server/docs/2.0/html/acc-ch.htm">
documentation</A> for the AOLserver describes how it distinguishes
BROWSE, PUT, MKDIR and DELETE as different administrative rights on
operations.
