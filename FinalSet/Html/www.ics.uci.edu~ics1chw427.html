With the <A
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.03.html">
Internet</A> leading us into what <A
HREF="http://www.inettech.com/web_resources/futurist/"> futurist </A>, <A
HREF="http://www.inettech.com/web_resources/futurist/toffler_alvin/">
Alvin Toffler </A> refers to as <A 
HREF="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/contents.html#toffler1"><i> 
"The Third Wave" </i></A> (or the "Knowledge Age"), in
which the new economy and power will be gaged by our capacity to access
information, new theories are surfacing both leery of and enthusiastic
about our latest evolving medium. 

<p> 

Developed as a means of accessing, navigationally, the tremendous amount
of information available on the <A
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.03.html">
Internet</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web</A> offers
an unbelievable amount of resources in the form of "Web sites" or "<A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html"> hypertext </A>
documents" without having to know a specialized computer-language. In
addition, its means of display has come to incorporate <A
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.02.html#1">
hypermedia</A> devises - such as in-line imaging, audio files, and
selectable formats - which has made this access to knowledge even more
engaging. With point-and-click instant access to the latest research and
information throughout the world, all available through what feels more
like an interactive monitor than a complex computer, words such as
"empowering" and "democratizing" have begun to surface in terms of its
access-ability to the non-computer-literate population. Stories have begun
to circulate of people, disenchanted with education or society - even gang
members - finding themselves drawn toward the involving nature of this new
medium.  As opposed to the broadcast model we have been accustomed to for
decades, which seems to have bred passivity, consumerism, and the
generating of lowest-common-denominator programming in an attempt to reach
the widest audiences, a new thirst for interactive forms of "stimulus"
(whether via on-line communication or virtual technologies) is emerging -
a desire to "investigate" beyond what is initially offered.  With people's
ability to choose the roles they wish to play, whether as consumers,
providers, or both, this new medium holds the promise of activism,
democracy, critical thinking, and quality through competition (as long as
it remains independent). 

<p>

Despite these positive effects, there have been many arguments surrounding
the Internet and Web regarding representation, social issues,
commercialism, regulation/censorship, physical architecture, and power. 
While these issues have roused theorists in every discipline, for the 
scope of this paper, only a partially list is represented below. Further, 
as each group's insights are understandably extensive, I will  
attempt to relay a fair assessment of their philosophy or analytical 
perspective.

<p>

One group of theorists approach the Net with <A
HREF="http://www.mcluhan.toronto.edu/"> Marshall McLuhan </A>-based media
analysis.  McLuhan, best known for his "The Medium is The Message"  and <A
HREF="gopher://gopher.mit.edu:3714/0D%20tiserve.mit.edu%209000%2036882%20mitpress">
"Understanding Media" </A>,wrote extensively on the nature of media and
its social-psychological effects.  Meeting regularly in Toronto at the <A
HREF="http://www.mcluhan.toronto.edu/sums/tyrie3.html"> McLuhan Research
Centre </A>, the group discusses the Information Hwy, from social issues
to highly technical issues. An <A 
HREF="http://www.mcluhan.toronto.edu/sums/tyrie3.html">over-view of 
their discussions </A> covers areas
such as: 

<ol>

<li> a front-end for the information highway
<li> just in time learning
<li> distance education
<li> systematic treatment of space using retrospective <br>
     GIS (Geographical Information Systems)
<li> systematic treatment of time with respect to telepresence in 2-D and 3-D
<li>integration of various tools  
</ol>

The over-view Web site, though not heavily linked, is detailed and fairly
substantial. 

<p>

A related group is comprised of students at the <A
HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/"><B> University of Pennsylvania </B></A> who
have organized an experimental course called <A
HREF="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/"><I> "Netsurf: the
Discussion Seminars"</I></A>.  The course Web site, entitled <A
HREF="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/"> "Social Implications
of Information Technologies" </A> includes topics such as:<br>

<ul>
<li> History of Media Technologies
<li> Social Psychology of Media Effects
<li> Current issues: copyright law and software piracy
<li> Current issues: Privacy, Cryptography, and the Panopticon 
<li> Future Directions. 
</ul>

Within each topic are links to various documents pertaining to those
issues. The course approaches each subject with three underlying themes:<br>

<ol>
<li><B> The Filtering Function </B> - ask: source? medium? filter? target?"
<li><B> Synthesis vs Analysis </B> - what is the part? what is the whole? 
how do they relate? - do we perhaps sacrifice depth for breadth of 
knowledge?
<li><B> Do your own research </B> - <i>Browse, search, ask</i>. Be 
creative. 
</ol>

The course page offers a partially linked fairly extensive reading list, 
as well, ranging from Marshall McLuhan and Alvin Toffler theoretical 
books to <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/newform.html"><i>Wired</i></A> and 
Time magazine interviews with other techno. or media-specialists. 
<br>
<p>

**There are two other very interesting articles written for <i>Wired</i> 
magazine that are in keeping with this course.  The first is <A
HREF="http://www.wired.com/Etext/1.5/features/toffler.html"> an interview
with futurist Alvin Toffler </A> on his book <A
HREF="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/contents.html#toffler1">
"Shock Wave"</A> and the other is <A
HREF="http://www.wired.com/Etext/1.3/features/kapor.on.nii.html"> a
theoretical essay on the Digital Highway with a Jeffersonian to
Information Policy</A>, which is incredibly interesting and ranges from
political, to social, to technical analyses. <B>HOWEVER</B>, you must <A 
HREF="http://www.wired.com/newform.html"> join<i>Wired</i> Magazine 
on-line </A>, or you will be denied access to both articles. 

<p>

The <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu/"> National Academy of Sciences </A>
created the <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu/1/nap"><i>National Academy
Press</i></A> to publish reports issued by the National Academy of
Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine,
and the National Research Council.  <A
HREF="http://xerxes.nas.edu:70/1/nap/online/rtif">"Realizing the
Information Future: The Internet and Beyond"</A> is one of NAP's
publications discussing the lastest issues concerning the National
Information Infrastructure (NII). Areas of discussion include defining the
purpose of the NII, social and economic implications, funding
arrangements, management responsibilities, increasing commercial service,
technical issues, and choosing an appropriate physical infrastructure.
Topics overlap some of those on the<A
HREF="http://www.ibm.com/Sponsor/g7live/G7live.html"> G7 Live Home
Page</A> (Group of Seven Conference Coverage) - another unbelievable site
with the latest discussions regarding the "Information Superhwy". 

<p>

<A HREF="http://www.pff.org/">The Progress and Freedom Foundation</A> is a
Republican based organization who, while striving to be analytical in its
various publications, is nevertheless, strictly pro-progress - "an
organization whose aim is to create a positive vision of the future". 
With its board of directors' and fellows' backgrounds lying in economics,
politics, military, and foreign affairs many of their projects carry
economic and political overtones such as their <A
HREF="http://www.pff.org/position.html">Magna Carta for the Knowledge
Age"</A> referred to often by House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA).  Their
approach to the new medium, then, focuses mainly on public policy and
information technology.

"What is Computer-Mediated Communication?" is a definition offered by John
December for Computer-Mediated Communication Magazine (of which December
is also editor and publisher
- -http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/cmc/mag/masthead.html - another great site)
which not only defines the concept but also enumerates various types of   
studies done on the topic from within each discipline - including social,
cognitive/psychological, linguistic, cultural, technical, and political
aspects or drawn from such fields as human communication, rhetoric, 
composition, media studies, human-computer interaction, journalism,
telecommunications, computer science, technical communication, or
information studies.  What's amazing about this site is that he provides
links to each discipline's theories, some with web pages and some with
mainpoint listings of various theorists' articles. An incredibly
comprehensive site.
