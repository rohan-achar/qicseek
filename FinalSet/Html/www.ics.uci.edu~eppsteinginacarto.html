<H2>Cartography and Geographic Information Systems</H2></A>

A geographic information system (GIS) is simply a database of
information about natural and man-made geographic features such as
roads, buildings, mountains... These systems can be used for making
maps, but also for analyzing data e.g. for facility location.  There has
been some communication between the geometry and GIS communities (e.g.
geographer Michael Goodchild gave an invited lecture on "Computational
Geography" at the <A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/contributions/snoeyink/acm-scg.html">11th
ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.</A>) but more could be done to bring them
together.  Geographic problems already visible in the geometry community
include <A HREF="interpolate.html">interpolation of surfaces from scattered data</A>,
overlaying planar subdivisions, hierarchical representations of
terrain information, boundary simplification,
lossy compression of elevation data (e.g. by using a piecewise linear
approximation with few facets), and map labelling.  Other
interesting geometric issues include handling of approximate and
inconsistent data, matching similar features from different databases,
compression of large geographic databases, cooperation between raster
and vector representations, visibility analysis, and generation of
cartograms (maps with area distorted to represent other information such
as population).

<P>A particularly important geometric data structure in geographic
analysis is the <A HREF="voronoi.html">Voronoi diagram</A>, which has been
used for to identify regions of influence of clans and other population
centers, model plant and animal competition, piece together satellite
photographs, estimate ore reserves, perform marketing analysis, and
estimate rainfall.
