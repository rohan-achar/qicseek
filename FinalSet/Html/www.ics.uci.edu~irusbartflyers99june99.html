<p>
Activity Theory offers a framework in which to analyze systems to
identify requirements for technologies, as well as for organization
design and processes. This presentation focuses on the application of
activity theory in industrial software engineering (design, development
and maintenance).
<p>
Various data collection methodologies can be applied for gathering
data from situated work. Ethnography is one particular qualitative
methodology for data collection in a natural setting. Activity Theory
is a socio-cultural theory that lends useful models to analyze the data
collected from ethnography. The models we have adopted from Activity
Theory serve as a lens to interpret data we have collected from software
maintenance and customer support settings.
<p>
Activity Theory helps us understand the multi-dimensional nature of
customer support "systems". We provide specific examples of the
application of Activity Theory and ethnographic methods
to identifying improvements in workflow processes and tools.

<strong>Biographies:</strong>
<p>
Patricia Collins is a researcher at Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories where she has focused most recently on technology
strategies for the knowledge engineering-management lifecycle. Her
previous research was in the area of software reuse, especially domain
analysis and the use of capability-readiness models for developing
organizational development roadmaps in software reuse. Patricia holds a
MSEE from Stanford University and a B.A. in mathematics and philosophy
from Dickinson College.
<p>
Shilpa Shukla is a Doctoral student in the Information and
Computer Science Department at the University of California Irvine. Her
research focuses on studying the bug management workflow processes using
a data collection methodology known as ethnography. Shilpa combines
software engineering theories with a socio-cultural theory to analyze
ethnographic data. Previously she studied Apple's bug tracking and
HP's customer support processes. The results of her analysis are
intended to help software researchers better understand and design
bug management processes. Shilpa holds a Masters from University of
California Irvine in Human Computer Interaction and a B.S. in
Information and Computer Science with a focus on sofware engineering.
