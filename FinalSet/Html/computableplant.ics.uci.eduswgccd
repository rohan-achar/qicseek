        Graph-Constrained Correlation Dynamics allows the specification of
        models that describe probability
        distributions which evolve continuously in time according to the
        chemical master equation. 
        This is accomplished by  combining a
        Markov Random Field, which represents the instantaneous
        probability of the system, with a set 
        of ordinary differential equations on the parameters of the MRF.

        GCCDdd is an implementation of GCCD
	within the <i><a href="http://wolfram.com">Mathematica</a></i>  
        programming language, available 
	<a href="gccddd.tar.gz">here</a>. This package also includes
        two example GCCD models. 
        GCCDdd is offered with the
	GNU Public License; essentially you are free to create
	derivative works, as long as they too carry a license as open
	as the GPL. 

	<br />
	<br />

        In order to use GCCDdd, you will need the Depenency Diagrams
	package, which is available <a href="/sw/dd/">here</a>.
