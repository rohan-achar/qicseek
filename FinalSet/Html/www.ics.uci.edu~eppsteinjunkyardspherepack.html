Sphere Packing and Kissing Numbers
</H2>
Problems of arranging balls densely arise in many
situations, particularly in coding theory (the balls are formed by the
sets of inputs that the error-correction would map into a single
codeword).
<P>
The most important question in this area is Kepler's problem:
what is the most dense packing of spheres in space?
The answer is obvious to anyone who has seen grapefruit stacked in a
grocery store, but a proof remains elusive.
(It is known, however, that the usual grapefruit packing is
the densest packing in which the sphere centers form a
<A HREF="lattice.html">lattice</A>.)
<P>
The colorfully named "kissing number problem" refers
to the local density of packings: how many balls can touch another ball?
This can itself be viewed as a version of Kepler's problem
for spherical rather than Euclidean geometry.

triangle so they each touch the other two and two triangle sides. This
problem has a curious history, described in Wells' <i>Penguin Dictionary
of Curious and Interesting Geometry</i>: Malfatti's original (1803)
question was to carve three columns out of a prism-shaped block of
marble with as little wasted stone as possible, but it wasn't until 1967
that it was shown that these three mutually tangent circles are never
the right answer.
