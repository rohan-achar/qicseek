It was known that planar graphs have O(<i>n</i>) subgraphs isomorphic
to K<sub>3</sub> or K<sub>4</sub>. That is, K<sub>3</sub> and
K<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely
K<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Please refer only to the journal version, and not the earlier technical
report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal
version.
