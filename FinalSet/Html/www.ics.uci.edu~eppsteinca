      <h1><span>Which "Life"-Like Systems Have Gliders?</span></h1>
    </div>

    <p><span><a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/lifepage/">John
    Conway's "Game of Life"</a> has fascinated and inspired many
    enthusiasts, due to the emergence of complex behavior from a
    very simple system. One of the many interesting phenomena in
    life is the existence of "gliders": small patterns that move
    across the grid. Some authors have asserted that the gliders
    and other complex behaviors occurring in Life are unusual, for
    instance Wolfram: "Except for a few simple variants on the Game
    of Life, no other definite <a href="wolfram.html">class-4</a>
    two-dimensional cellular automata were found in a random sample
    of several thousand outer totalistic rules." Are gliders really
    so rare?</span></p>

    <p><span>I have investigated whether gliders exist in many <a
    href="lifelike.html">semitotalistic rules</a> similar to Life,
    where the behavior of a cell depends only on its own state and
    the number of live neighbors. The results show that the
    existence of gliders is commonplace, contradicting Wolfram and
    <a href="wolfram.html">calling into question his classification
    of cellular automata</a>.</span></p>
