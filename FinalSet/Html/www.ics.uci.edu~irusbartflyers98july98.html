<EM><strong><font size=+1>Distributed Object Technology for Wide-Area Shared Decision-making</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

We are employing distributed object technology to build a new generation 
of infrastructure for decision-making. In particular, DARPA has formulated 
a strategy for a Next Generation Information Infrastructure (NGII) that 
will augment and supersede the Defense Information Infrastructure now 
being deployed. Our company has provided the architecture and various 
components for this NGII. We began in 1994 by embracing the CORBA 
architecture (also known as the Object Management Architecture or OMA) 
and then proceeded to elaborate and refine it. Last year, we completed 
development of a third version of an "object web server" (OWS) that 
provides means for worldwide collaborators to create, modify, version, 
and partially replicate compound objects that correspond to decision 
products such as situation analyses and plans. Because the collaboration 
takes place over communication paths with up to five orders of magnitude 
speed and reliability variations, the entire system must be aware of and 
adaptive to variations in availability or quality of service. Beginning 
in 1998, we have begun to decompose the OWS into more composable elementary 
services. Later this year we will complete the first version of composable 
services for wide-area sharing of compound objects and will provide 
application frameworks that simplify the task of composing and employing 
these more elementary capabilities.

<strong>Biography:</strong>

Frederick Hayes-Roth is Chairman and CEO of Teknowledge, where 
he has worked for 16 years since co-founding the company. He became Chairman 
and CEO in 1993. He was the company's Chief Technology Officer, R&D Director, 
and Executive Vice President for Technology prior to becoming Chairman 
and CEO. Currently, Dr. Hayes-Roth devotes much of his time to serving 
as Chief Architect for the DARPA-DISA Next-Generation Information 
Infrastructure and several other programs and projects related to this. 
These programs are intended to develop the Leading Edge Services for the 
U.S. Defense Information Infrastructure. He has focused on the architecture 
and implementation of distributed intelligent systems for almost two 
decades. His work along these lines includes a series of seminal and 
successful efforts, such as the Hearsay-II Speech Understanding System 
and its blackboard architecture, opportunistic planning and meta-control, 
distributed module-oriented programming supported by the ABE development 
environment, the real-time architecture for the Pilots' Associate, the 
DICAM architecture for distributed intelligent control, and the DARPA 
Joint Task Force Reference Architecture. Dr. Hayes-Roth has published 
two books and more than 100 articles and has held research faculty 
appointments at MIT, CMU, and Stanford.

<EM><strong><font size=+1>Developing JavaBeans Components: An Overview
</em></strong></EM><br>

<p>

The widespread adoption of the JavaTM programing language by the Internet 
community creates an opportunity for developers to create a new class of 
interactive applications. The language and environment specifications 
provide mechanisms for the creation and management of small reusable 
feature sets known as JavaBeans. The goal of the Beans architecture is 
to define a Java Platform component model so that third party ISV's can 
create and ship components composed together into applications by end 
users. Using Java RMI and Java RMI over IIOP allows for the possibility 
of distributing Bean functionality across platforms.

<strong>Biography: </strong>
Reginald Adkins is the JavaBeans Team Beans Development Kit 
(BDK) Engineer at Sun Microsystems. He is responsible for the deployment 
of the BDK, as well as the implementation for the reference Bean container, 
the BeanBox. Prior to working at Sun on the Beans component software 
architecture, Reginald worked for three years at Apple Computer, Inc. on 
the multi-platform, CORBA compliant component software architecture, 
OpenDocTM. Before OpenDoc and other summer stints in Apple's Advanced 
Technology and Functional Technology Groups, Reginald worked for three 
years at NASA/Goddard in Greenbelt, MD in the data networks division. 
Reginald holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Drexel University, in 
Philadelphia, PA.
