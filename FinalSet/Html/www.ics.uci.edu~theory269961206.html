Reconstructing a Three-Dimensional Model with Arbitrary Errors<br>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~tdo/">Thuan Do</a>, ICS, UC
Irvine</h2>

A number of current technologies allow for the determination of
inter-atomic distance information in structures such as proteins
and RNA. Thus, the reconstruction of a three-dimensional set of
points using information about its inter-point distances has become
a task of basic importance in determining molecular structure. But
the measurements are error-prone and some of the entries of the
mesured distance matrix are arbitrarity "corrupted." 

<p>In this paper, the authors present an algorithm which runs in
O(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time, where <i>n</i> is the
number of points, and that algorithm can reconstruct the model of
points <i>P</i> from its distance matrix, which has many errors and
which is also not complete. The algorithm will produce a constant
number of point sets consistent to a given distance matrix <i>
M</i>, and one of them will be the correct point set <i>P</i>.</p>
