<H2> Pointers and Memory Allocation </H2>

When declaring a variable, the type given is the type of any expression
which looks like the declaration.  Thus, if we have the declarations
<center>
<tt>    int a, *b, c[], *(*d[])();</tt>
</center>
then, in the code, the expressions
<tt>a</tt>, <tt>*b</tt>, <tt>c[]</tt> and <tt>*(*d[])()</tt>
would all evaluate to an integer.&nbsp;
Encountering the declaration, you might
have a hard time figuring out that <tt>d</tt> is an
array of pointers to functions which return integer pointers,
but you <I>do</I> know what type it will evaluate to
when used in the context given.&nbsp;
Thus you know that the statement
<tt>a = *(*d[5])(x, y)</tt>
will place an integer in <tt>a</tt>, even if you are not
sure what happened.&nbsp;
You could similarly match types by stripping
off matching levels of indirections:&nbsp;
<tt>b = (*d[5])(x, y)</tt> would store
an integer pointer in <tt>b</tt> rather than the value of the integer.
<P>
Although the expression given in the declaration is generally the
<I>correct</I> way to use the variable,
the relation between pointers and arrays allows for other uses.&nbsp;
Since an array name is just a pointer, we can actually use the
expressions <tt>b[]</tt> and <tt>*c</tt> as well.&nbsp;
(Using the alternate notation is
often confusing but occasionally more clear.)&nbsp;
For example, the sixth
element of an array, declared by either of the two methods mentioned
above, can be accessed in either of the two following methods:&nbsp;
<center>
<tt>    b[5]</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>*(b+5)</tt>
</center>
(Recall that the monadic "<tt>*</tt>" operator merely takes the
value at the right and performs one level of indirection on it.)
The second method adds 5*(size of the array element type) to the address
of array, resulting in a pointer to the sixth element, and then the "*"
causes an indirection on that address, resulting in the value stored
there.  The subscripted notation is merely shorthand for this.
<P>
For a lab, your testing programs might know that the input is restricted
to 1000 digits, but your multiplier should not know this.&nbsp;
Thus, you will need to allocate one-dimensional arrays of unpredictable
size within these functions.&nbsp;
To do this, use the system library
function <I>malloc</I> which will give you a specified number of
contiguous bytes of memory.&nbsp;
You must first, in your declarations,
tell the compiler the type of the return value of
<I>malloc</I> with the
declaration (along with your variable declarations):&nbsp;
<center>
<tt>char *malloc();</tt>
</center>
<P>
Now, let's say you want an array of 10 integers.&nbsp;
Let <tt>A</tt> be
an integer pointer (declared <tt>int *A</tt>).&nbsp;
To get the array, use the command:
<center>
<tt>    A = (int *) malloc( 10 * sizeof(int) );</tt>
</center>
The <tt>sizeof()</tt> function is expanded by the compiler to be the
number of bytes in one element of the type given as the argument.&nbsp;
Thus, if there are 4 bytes in
an integer, <I>malloc</I> will return 40 bytes
(beginning on a double-word
boundary to guarantee proper alignment of multiple-byte objects -- you
don't need to worry about this).
<P>
The <tt>(int *)</tt> preceeding the function call is called a
<I>cast</I>.
This changes the
type of the return of <I>malloc</I>
(which is a character pointer) into an
integer pointer so that it may be stored in <tt>A</tt>.&nbsp;
Often casts only
affect the compiler's internal representation of what a type is but
occasionally they generate code to physically modify data, so you should
almost always use them when mixing things of differing types.
<P>
Always make sure, after calling <I>malloc</I>, that you actually got the
space you requested.&nbsp;
<I>Malloc</I> will return a null pointer if it could not
get you the space.&nbsp;
A null pointer can be represented in your code as a
zero, or as <tt>NULL</tt>
if you include the standard I/O file <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>.
<P>
Finally, the function <I>free</I> is used to return space to the
operating system which was allocated by <I>malloc</I>.&nbsp;
You should give,
as a parameter, to <I>free</I> exactly the pointer given to you by
<I>malloc</I>.&nbsp;
You cannot give back part of an allocation.&nbsp;
Thus there
should be exactly as many calls to <I>free</I> as to <I>malloc</I>, and
they should involve exactly the same blocks of memory.
<P>
<H3> Multi-dimensional arrays </H3>

C uses two implementations of arrays, depending on the declaration.
They are the same for one dimension, but different for more dimensions.
<P>
For example, if an array is declared as
<center>
<tt>int array[10][20][30];</tt>
</center>
than there are exactly 6000 ints of storage allocated, and a reference
of the form <tt>array[i][j][k]</tt> will be translated to
<center>
<tt>*( array + i*20*30 + j*30 + k )</tt>
</center>
which calculates the correct offset from the pointer "array", and then
does an indirection on it.  To pass an array of this type to a
procedure, you must declare the parameter as
<center>
<tt>proc( arg ) int arg[][20][30];</tt>
</center>
(You may declare the value of the first dimension, but the compiler
doesn't care since it is not needed.)
<P>
You will probably not be using this kind of array, since you don't have
constant bounds on the sizes of any of your arrays.
<P>
The second type of array is a pointer-vector structure, where each
dimension is represented by a vector of pointers of objects of the next
dimension, except the last dimension, which consists of arrays of data.
This sounds like a mess, but it really isn't:
<P>
If a three-dimensional array is declared as
<center>
<tt>int ***array;</tt>
</center>
(and we will assume for the moment that it has been allocated space
for a 10*20*30 array), then there is an array of 10 pointers to pointers
to ints, 10 arrays of 20 pointers to ints, and 6000 ints.&nbsp;
The 200 elements of the 10 arrays each point to a block of 30 ints,
and the 10 elements of the one array each point
to one of the 10 arrays.&nbsp;
The array variable points to the head of the array with 10 elements.
<P>
In short,
"<tt>array</tt>" points to a pointer to a pointer to an integer,
"<tt>*array</tt>" points to a pointer to an integer,
"<tt>**array</tt>" points to an integer, and
"<tt>***array</tt>" is an integer.
<P>
In this case, an access of the form <tt>array[i][j][k]</tt>
results in an access of the form
<center>
<tt>*( *( *(array+i) + j ) + k )</tt>
</center>
<P>
Which means:&nbsp;
Take a pointer to the main array, add <tt>i</tt> to offset to the
pointer to the correct second dimension array and indirect to it.&nbsp;
Now we have a pointer to one of the arrays of 20 pointers,
and we add <tt>j</tt> to get the offset to the next dimension,
and we do an indirection on that.&nbsp;
We now have a pointer to an array of 30 integers,
so we add <tt>k</tt> to get a pointer to the desired integer,
do an indirection, and we have the integer.
<P>
Passing arrays of this type is simple,
you declare the parameter the same way, as "<tt>int ***arrayname</tt>".
<P>
Now the fun begins:&nbsp; how to allocate memory for a pointer-vector
array.&nbsp;  We get memory with the function
<center>
<tt>char *malloc( nbytes );</tt>
</center>
<I>malloc</I> returns a character pointer to a contiguous block of
<I>nbytes</I> bytes, or a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer
(<tt>NULL</tt> is defined in the library package
<tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>) if it cannot get the space.
<P>
As before, we will assume that the variable is defined as
<center>
<tt>int ***array;</tt>
</center>
and we want the dimensions to be 10*20*30 (all of the stuff below could
be done for an arbitrary i,j,k, which is closer to what you need).
<P>
First, we need an array of 10 <tt>int **</tt>'s,
so we use the following:
<center>
<tt>array = (int ***) malloc( 10 * sizeof(int **) );</tt>
</center>
The <I>sizeof</I> function returns an integer telling how many bytes
are needed by something of type "<tt>int **</tt>",
and we need 10 of them.&nbsp;
The "<tt>(int ***)</tt>" is a cast which changes the pointer type
from "<tt>char *</tt>" to "<tt>int ***</tt>",
to keep the types correct.&nbsp;
Don't forget that, after this
call to <I>malloc</I>, you should check to see if <tt>array==NULL</tt>.
<P>
Note:&nbsp; <I>malloc</I> is asked for 10 <tt>int **</tt>'s
but its return is a pointer to them,
so the result is an <tt>int ***</tt>.
<P>
Now that we have the 10 pointers, we can get the next level of
pointers:
<pre>
	for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i ) {
	    array[i] = (int **) malloc( 20 * sizeof(int *) );
	}
</pre>
And finally, we can fill in each of these pointers with an array of 30
integers:
<pre>
	for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i ) {
	    for ( j = 0 ; j < 20 ; ++j ) {
		array[i][j] = (int *) malloc( 30 * sizeof(int) );
	    }
	}
</pre>
Again, remember that each call to malloc must check the result.&nbsp;
Also note that we could have put the two steps above together,
filling each set of 20 pointers as we get them.
<P>
It is <I>much</I> more efficient to combine all similar allocations
and divide up the memory after getting it.&nbsp;
(It is also <I>much</I> easier to make mistakes.)&nbsp;
When you've convinced yourself the the following works, you will
understand C pointers fairly well.
<P>
<pre>
	array = (int ***) malloc( 10 * sizeof(int **) );
	array[0] = (int **) malloc( 10 * 20 * sizeof( int *) );
	array[0][0] = (int *) malloc( 10 * 20 * 30 * sizeof(int) );
	for ( j = 1  ;  j < 20  ;  ++j ) {
	    array[0][j] = array[0][j-1] + 30;
	}
	for ( i = 1  ;  i < 10  ;  ++i ) {
	    array[i] = array[i-1] + 20;
	    array[i][0] = array[i-1][20-1] + 30;
	    for ( j = 1  ;  j < 20  ;  ++j ) {
		array[i][j] = array[i][j-1] + 30;
	    }
	}
</pre>
<P>
This is the method you should use, but you will probably only need two
dimensional arrays,
which are far easier once you understand this example.
<P>
Space is returned to the system with the command
<center>
<tt>free( pointer );</tt>
</center>
<P>
For returning the space to the system, you <I>always</I>
return exactly what
you were given, <I>i.e.</I>,
the exact pointer that <I>malloc</I> gave you.&nbsp;
You cannot return a portion of an allocation.&nbsp;
Thus there should be a perfect 
one-to-one correspondence between calls to <I>malloc</I>
and calls to <I>free</I>.
