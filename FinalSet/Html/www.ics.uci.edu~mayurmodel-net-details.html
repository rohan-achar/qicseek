<h2>:: Introduction</h2>
<p>
This writeup is intended more as a reminder to myself of what I learnt when setting up Modelnet.
I had never worked with a emulator such as this before, so I had many questions going into it.
This document is written form the point of view of what questions I would have like to have had
answered without doing too much RTFM :-) For the definitive page on Modelnet, please visit the
<a href="http://issg.cs.duke.edu/modelnet.html">Modelnet home page</a>.
<p>

<h2>:: What is Modelnet? </h2>
<p>
Modelnet is software that lets you get a feel (or numbers)
for what would happen if you deployed your next killer-app distributed application (like say, BitTorrent)
over the Internet. What this means is that you can deploy hundreds of instances of the application over
nodes that behave as if they were distributed all over the world. Modelnet will then emulate,
actual packet delays/losses/throughput of packets flowing between the different instances of the app.
This is quite invaluable if you are testing Peer-to-Peer applications and want to get some
hard numbers.
<p>

<h2>:: So, how does it work? </h2>
<p>
OK. Here is the whole works.
<br>
<p align="center">.<img border="1" src="modelnet-succint.png" width="400" height="300"><p>

Looks a bit complicated but the system can be easily broken down and explained in parts. There are two
different types of physical nodes (read PCs) that Modelnet uses: (1) Emulator nodes (that run FreeBSD)
and (2) nodes that run the application processes (Linux nodes). The Emulator node emulates what happens
to packets as they traverse the Internet. Virtual nodes are run on the Linux machines.

The concept of a virtual node is a bit `abstract' and is achieved through clever use of
(a)IP-aliasing, (b) Route-setup and a (c) Custom library that intercepts IP packets. We'll look into
each in some more detail and then tie them together. But, first, here is how to run an application
on a particular virtual node: "SRCIP=10.0.x.x LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libipaddr.so [application] [application_params]".
Once we get through the details, it'll be more obvious why this command is so.
<br>
</p>

<h3>IP-Aliasing </h3>
<p>
When you install Modelnet on a machine, it sets up
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/IP-Alias.html">IP-aliases</a> corresponding to the number
of virtual nodes that the physical host will emulate. All the ip-addresses are from the "10.0.x.x" domain.
For example, if a physical host will emulate 2 virtual nodes, expect to see something like
the following in your /sbin/ifonfig output: "eth:0:0 inet addr:10.0.0.1", "eth:0:1 inet addr:10.0.0.2" (assuming
your NIC card is setup as eth0).
</p>

<h3>Route Setup</h3>
<p>
Modelnet also sets up the routing table in each physical host so that all packets (in the 10.0.x.x domain)
are routed to the  emulator node. This is important so that packets from two virtual nodes that are on the
same physical machine still flow through the emulator and not the loopback interface. Read the
<a href="http://issg.cs.duke.edu/modelnet/modelnet.html"> Modelnet documentation </a> for more details
on this. If you have the patience, work out the exact route for two virtual nodes on the same physical node,
using the route information on a host; it is quite fascinating. These two references
<a href="http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/usersguide/linux_ugrouting.html"> (1) </a> and
<a href="http://www.eventhelix.com/RealtimeMantra/Networking/ip_routing.htm"> (2) </a> on subnetting
and routing might be of aid.
</p>

<h3>Custom Library</h3>
<p>
Modelnet also installs a custom library on the physical host (libipaddr.so). When the command line is invoked
appropriately, all IP packets are handled by this library. The way to specify the library is to prefix
the following in the command line: "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libipaddr.so" (Btw, the library may get installed in a
different place on your system, say /lib/libipaddr.so, figure that out first). In the prefix of the command line,
we also add "SRCIP=10.0.x.x" (substitute with the actual virtual node IP-address). This is so that the custom
library can write the appropriate host-ip address in each packet (for example, if SRCIP is specified as 10.0.0.1,
then all outgoing packets will have src-ip as 10.0.0.1).
</p>

<h3>WTF is LD_PRELOAD?</h3>
<p>
LD_PRELOAD is a way of achieving
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/lib_interposers.html"> "library interpositioning"</a>, a
cool system hack used for achieving, among other things, debugging and performance analysis.
Basically, any system call can be intercepted and custom code can  be run in that call. For example, one
can write a custom library that prints 'hello world' whenever a packet is sent out; annoying but possible.
</p>

<h3>Putting it together</h3>
<p>
To run an executable on a particular virtual node, we therefore prefix the following before the executable name:
"SRCIP=10.0.x.x LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libipaddr.so". This tell the custom library to rewrite the IP packets with
the SRCIP ip address. The packet is then sent out as normal to the destination. If the destination is another
virtual node, then the packet is sent to the emulator (default gateway for all 10.0.x.x packets). The routes in
the emulator are so set up, that the packet is then routed to the physical host that has the destination
virtual-ip. If an application is listening to packets on the remote virtual node, it gets the packets. Further,
if the remote app want to send back a reply, it reverses the src and destination ip addresses. The reverse path
is then followed and the local virtual node get the packet. Inside the emulator appropriate delays and traffic
shaping is done.
<a href="http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html"> Netperf</a>  is a neat tool that you can use to test
this out. As the Modelnet tutorial warns you, don't use ping to test connectivity between two virtual nodes. Ping
uses raw sockets and these packets are not intercepted by the Modelnet custom library.
</p>
<br>

<h2>::What applications can I run on top of Modelenet?</h2>
<p>
Modelnet provides a script called vnrunhost that runs a application/executable on a particular virtual node. For some
reason, I found that this raised many questions (before I looked into the script).  Could the application
be a shell script?, How many paramaters could I pass to the application?, etc. Turns out, that vnrunhost
is a simple wrapper that maps virtual node ids to virtual ips and then calls the usual "SRCIP= .. LD_PRELOAD=...".
So, the short answer is that almost any application can use Modelnet (unless it plays around with Raw sockets or
specifically binds to a particular local ip-address). Moreover, the presence of Modelnet underneath is totally
transparent to the application. You can even run `ls' on Modelnet (not that it would be of any
particular significance).
</p>


<h2>:: So, how does the emulator emulate the Internet? </h2>
<p>
First, a tool such as
<a href="http://topology.eecs.umich.edu/inet/">Inet</a> is used to generate topology of the routers in the
Internet. Inet cam also spit out `router coordinates' i.e. it places each router in a XY plane and prints
the cartesian corordinates for each router. Modelnet directly interprets these coordinates, assiging longer
latencies (in milliseconds) between farther routers. Assigning bandwidth is a different beast. The easiset
solution is to specify a lower bandwith mark and an upper bandwidth mark. Modelnet will then assign, at random,
a bandiwth between these two marks to each end node. Is is assumed that the router backbone can handle all the
end nodes' bandwidths (clearly a simplification but still a reasonable assumption for most experiments). Once
Modelnet generates the route and model files, one can also "hand-code" different bandwidths for each node.
Lastly, Modelnet allows one to specify packet loss rates on each link. Again, a high and low mark can be set and
Modelnet will randomly assign packet loss rates within this range to each link.
</p>


<h2>:: Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
As mentioned, Netperf is a very handy tool to figure out if the bandwidth and latency constraints between
two nodes are being emulated correctly. Occasionally, some strange problems crop up. Here are some of the
stranger ones. Might be of use if you see something familiar.
</p>

<h3>SRCIP not SRC_IP</h3>
<p>
For some reason, I had switched to writing SRC_IP instead of SRCIP in the prefix on the command line (guess
I was instinctively following my coding guidelines :).
Netperf, applications, everything, stopped working suddenly. Took me a while to see the typo and drove
me insane in the meantime.
</p>

<h3>IPv6</h3>
<p>
I like to customize my Linux kernels and build them from source. In a particular kernel build, I had enabled
IPv6. For some reason, this interacts very strangely with Modelnet. So, if you are building your own Linux
Kernel, disable IPv6.  And don't even ask how I figured this out!
</p>


<h2>:: Parting thoughts </h2>
<p>
As I said before, I had not used a wide area network emulator before. Installing Modelnet and using it
showed me how some cool hacks have made such a thing possible, and this is without even going into
the complexity of the emulator code. It is almost magical when you actually run apps on top of it and
see the whole thing in action. Its like seeing a storm in a bottle or the Internet on a bunch of
local-area machines. Years of research (on modelling the Internet topology and such) have made this
emulator possible. If you have any questions feel free to shoot me an email. I'll reply
if I have any answer(s) and maybe add it to this page as well.
