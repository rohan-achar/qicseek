<h2>22 Apr 2005:<br>
The Maximum-Mean Subtree
<br>
Josiah Carlson
</h2>
<p>
In this talk, we define the Maximum-Mean Subtree problem on trees, an
equivalent reformulation of the Fractional Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree
Problem on Trees. We describe an algorithm that solves the Maximum-Mean
Subtree problem, and prove that our algorithm runs in O(n) time in the
worst case, improving a previous O(n log n) algorithm.

<p>
This talk is a presentation of a paper by David Eppstein and Josiah
Carlson, which was submitted to WADS 2005.
