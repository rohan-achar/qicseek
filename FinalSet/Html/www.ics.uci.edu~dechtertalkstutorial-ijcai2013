<p>
Constraint networks and Bayesian networks can be viewed within the general 
framework of graphical models which includes also  Markov random fields, cost networks and influence diagrams. 
Graphical models are knowledge representation schemes
that capture independencies in the knowledge base and support efficient,
graph-based algorithms for a variety of tasks, including
scheduling, planning, diagnosis and situation assessment, design, and
hardware and software verification. 
</p>

<p>
Algorithms for processing constraints and probabilistic models 
are of two primary types:inference-based and search-based and they support 
exact and approximate algorithms. Exact Inference (e.g., variable
elimination, join-tree clustering) are time and space exponentially bounded
by the tree-width of the problem's graph.  Exact Search-based algorithms (e.g.,
backtracking search) can be executed in linear space and often outperform their
worst-case predictions. Constraint propagation schemes that approximate inference,  can be applied with a
 bounded time and space. Likewise stochastic scheme (e.g, local search and sampling schemes) can be interpreted as approximate full search. The thrust of advanced schemes is in finding the right balance between search and inference within a hybrid scheme.
 </p>


 <p>
 The tutorial will present the algorithmic principles behind the progress that has been made in the past decades in constraint processing and probabilistic reasoning for answering a variety of queries such as: determining consistency and finding one or all solutions, finding optimal solutions and answering likelihood and counting queries. 
 Complexity analysis and empirical demonstration  will be
 presented on variety of benchmarks.  Example benchmarks include
 radio-frequency problems, linkage analysis, combinatorial auctions, and coding networks.
