The following is a list of zipped Eclipse programming project files (more
  might be added during the semester).
Please feel free to download, unzip, and study these programs (both their code
  and their run-time behavior).
Programmers gain tremendous insight into all facets of programming by studying
  the code of other programmers (especially those with more experience; and I
  am happy to improve my code based on your observations -nothing is perfect).
A good programmer typically makes elegant use of the required language
  features, resulting in smaller, more elegant code.
<p>
All downloaded projects are listed alphabetically.
All are zip files, so unzip them first.
Most project files require the standard course library 
 (<b>edu.uci.ics.pattis.introlib</b>;
 if you followed the Eclipse installation instructions, you should be fine with
 this <b>jar</b> file: reread the direction if necessary).

Finally, it prints some statistics about the scores in this file.
<p>

Download: <a href="programs/backtracking.zip">Backtracking</a><br>
These programs use a generalized backtracking search to search an implicit
  game tree.

  and the <b>Solver</b> class, which solves any problem expressible by a class
  implementing this interface.
The <b>NQueens</b> package contains a <b>NQueens</b> class and a simple
  application that uses <b>Solver</b> to solve it (how to place N queens on
  a chessboard so that none can attack another).
The <b>Satifiability</b> package contains a <b>Satisfiability</b> class and a 
  simple application that uses <b>Solver</b> to solve it (how to assign T/F
  values to variables in a formula to satisfy it -make it evaluated to true).
The <b>Sudoku</b> package contains a <b>Sudoku</b> class and a simple
  application that reads a Sudoku puzzle and uses <b>Solver</b> to solve it
 (how to assign 1-9 values to cells in a Sudoku puzzle to satisfy its

  green, and blue components in the range [0..255].
These colors are all represented by <code>ModularCounter</code>s, and
  the <b>Model</b> class has a <b>main</b> method so that it can be
  tested independently form the Controller and View.
Note, the hex value can be used in HTML to specify a color.

Download: <a href="programs/collatzwithobjects.zip">
  Collatz Conjecture</a><br>
The Collatz conjecture states: starting with any positive number, repeat the
  process "If it is even, halve it; if it is odd, multiply it by three and
  add one" and eventually the remaining value reduces to one.
No one has been able to prove this conjecture, but a short program allows you
  to investigate it.
It is interesting to obseve the number of cycles required to reduce the
  starting number to 1, looking for a pattern.
This program uses the <code>BigInteger</code> class to allow arbitrarily large
  values (not restricted to the bounded type <b>int</b>) and the
  <code>Timer</code> class to keep track of the processing time.
