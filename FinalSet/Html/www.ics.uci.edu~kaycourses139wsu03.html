<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Teaching assistant:</B> Dhawal Shah (</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="mailto:shahd@uci.edu">shahd@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>).
 Dhawal will devote some of the scheduled lab section time to individual
consultations; he will also be available at other scheduled times to be
arranged, and by appointment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Course goals:</B>  Even if you intend to
spend your entire professional life designing software or configuring networks,
you will spend more of it writing prose--memos, proposals, documentation,
electronic mail--than you will writing code.  Yet in most of your courses,
you exercise this vital skill only after you have run the last test case,
in the half-hour before the deadline.  Here we have the luxury of concentrating
on your writing skills, with an emphasis on writing to meet the specific
needs of different audiences; you will also make oral presentations and
design presentation graphics.  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This course satisfies UCI&#39;s upper division
writing requirement, which gives students the opportunity to do writing
in ways that are specific to their own academic disciplines, guided by faculty
from that discipline rather than from English.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  Satisfaction
of the lower division writing requirement is a prerequisite for this course,
so we will expect every student to be able to write cogent, grammatical
English at the level expected in Writing 39C.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 3:50 in Computer Science 180.  The discussion
section meets Wednesdays and Fridays from 2:00 to 2:50 in CS 180; some section
days will involve required activities, but others will be set aside for
individual consultations on your work. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Office hours:  </B>I will be in or near
my office during these scheduled hours, during which course-related matters
will have first priority:  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:15 to 12:55. 
Of course emergencies may come up, but I will try to give advance notice
of any change.  If I&#39;m not immersed in something else, I&#39;ll be glad
to answer short questions whenever I&#39;m in my office, so feel free to
drop by any time.  I&#39;ll also be happy to make appointments for other
times during the week.  The quickest and most effective way to reach me
is by electronic mail, as described below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(though a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail
to the ID </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="mailto:ics139w@uci.edu">ics139w@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.
 This goes to both of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you
need to reach one of us individually, our individual addresses are listed
above.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>We may also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another
account, you should set your UCInet account to forward your Email to your
preferred account (from </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate">http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
you can do this on the web).  Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official
announcements, your grade could suffer.   </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This course has a home page at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://e3.uci.edu/03y/36130">http://e3.uci.edu/03y/36130</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>

<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Course materials:</B><I>The MIT Guide to
Science and Engineering Communication,</I> second edition, by James Paradis
and Muriel Zimmerman.  This brief guide describes the various forms of scientific
and technical writing, including sections on oral presentations and document
design.
<BR>
<I>Visual &amp; Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Decision
Making, </I>by Edward R. Tufte.  This reprint of Chapter 2 of Tufte&#39;s
book, <I>Visual Explanations,</I> describes two situations where the way
information was presented had life-or-death consequences.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>An English dictionary.  Ideally you should
have a paperback dictionary as well as a large, unabridged dictionary in
the place where you&#39;ll do most of your writing.  The former has faster
access time but the latter has greater capacity, so both are valuable. 
A paperback thesaurus is also useful, though you should remember that a
thesaurus doesn&#39;t give the connotations or appropriate contexts for
the synonyms it lists.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><I>Writing from A to Z</I> (currently in the
third edition) by Ebest, Alred, Brusaw, and Oliu.  This is the writing reference
for lower division writing at UCI.  Everyone needs a general writing reference,
and you should get this one if you don&#39;t have it or an equivalent. 
Earlier editions are fine.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Course requirements and grading:  </B>To
satisfy the upper division writing requirement, you must receive a grade
of C or better in this course; you may also take this class on a pass/not-pass
basis (which also requires work at the C level to pass).  In addition to
satisfactory participation and completion of the assignments, to pass 139W
you must successfully complete an in-class writing sample (described in
more detail in the following section) demonstrating your ability to write
a short passage in clear, correct, grammatical, cogent academic English.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Four main writing assignments, each with
multiple parts:  &quot;Writing Instructions&quot; (about 10% of the course
grade), &quot;Influencing Policy&quot; (about 20%), &quot;Changing the System
Introductory Tutorial&quot; (about 15%), &quot;Changing the System Proposal&quot;
(about 25%).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Two or three smaller exercises, each worth
about 5%.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* Class attendance and participation, including
three or four oral presentations, worth about 20% overall.  The importance
of participation in this course is clear from its weight.  Much of the learning
comes from activities we conduct in class; there is no other way to make
them up, and your grade will suffer if you miss them.  The course outline
indicates certain activities with a bullet (*); it is particularly important
that you attend class or lab on those dates.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>In general we will assign scores on a 100-point
scale, with 95 a clear A, 85 a clear B, and below 70 not of passing quality
(i.e., below C).  It is possible but not guaranteed that the cutoffs for
course letter grades of A and B will be assigned more leniently; that is,
an overall score of 89% might receive an A or A-.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>There will be no exams.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>In-class writing sample:</B>  The first
in-class writing sample is scheduled for Tuesday, June 24; if you don&#39;t
pass the first sample, you will have another chance on Thursday, June 26.
 The topic for each sample will be something designed to be easy to write
about, so you can concentrate on your writing rather than the underlying
ideas.  In the 80-minute class period, we will ask you to write roughly
300 words (for comparison, this page contains nearly 600 words); this should
give you plenty of time to revise and rewrite your passage.  To pass, your
writing must have essentially perfect mechanics, grammar, and usage, and
it must be reasonably clear and well organized.  You may bring a dictionary
or any other reference works.  Being able to produce clear and correct writing
is a requirement for completing lower division writing, so we expect everyone
in the class to be able to demonstrate this ability.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Computer access:</B>  Students in ICS 139W
have access to the ICS open labs.  These machines run Windows and the Microsoft
Office suite of  software, including Word and PowerPoint.  For this course
you may use any system to which you legitimately have access; we will require
that you learn and use PowerPoint for part of one assignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Assignment requirements:</B>  The separate
sheet titled &quot;<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/139w/requirements.html">Writing Assignment Requirements</A>&quot;
contains important advice that can affect your grade.  Read it now and check
it again every time you start a new assignment.  There are also mechanical
details for submitting assignments; each major assignment is submitted in
two ways:  on paper (including all the previously submitted, marked versions)
and electronically via </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>).
 Especially in a condensed summer session, it&#39;s important that every
assignment be precisely where it&#39;s supposed to be at the time it&#39;s
supposed to be there.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>What you must do right now to get started
in ICS 139W:
<BR>
</B>-- If you do not have a UCInet ID (an account on the EA system for Email),
get one.  See </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/computing/activate.html">http://www.oac.uci.edu/computing/activate.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.
<BR>
-- If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your
UCInet account, redirect your mail at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate">http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate</A>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>-- Give a snapshot of yourself (with
your name written on the back) to your TA.  This will help us learn your
names quickly.  (This is not just for fun--it&#39;s a course requirement.)
 Also turn in your signed Questionnaire to your TA in discussion section.
<BR>
-- On the Web, go to </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,
log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing&quot; for &quot;Summer
1 2003,&quot; click &quot;Go&quot; next to ICS 139W, and then click &quot;List
me for this course.&quot;  You&#39;ll submit some of your work electronically;
this step is necessary to set that up.
<BR>
-- If you aren&#39;t yet officially enrolled in the course, check the course
Email archive regularly (see above) so you can keep up with official announcements
(which may include announcements about enrollment).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Good advice and helpful hints:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Check your electronic mail regularly; this
is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Attendance in class is important (and essential
on the days marked with a bullet (*) in the outline below).  Class participation
of various kinds is rewarded at 20% of the course grade.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the
shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened
in the past), we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>If you find yourself having trouble or getting
behind, speak with a TA or the instructor.  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut
of copying someone else&#39;s work and turning it in; the consequences can
be far worse than just a low score on one assignment.  The ICS department
takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more complete discussion, see
the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty issues:</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>The best advice we can give you is to read
all the materials with care and pay close attention to what they specify.
 Even if a natural language like English is not quite as precise as a formal
language like Java, precise expression in English is precisely what this
course is about and we have tried to reflect that in our course materials.
 The time it takes to read each assignment twice will be time well spent.</FONT></P>
