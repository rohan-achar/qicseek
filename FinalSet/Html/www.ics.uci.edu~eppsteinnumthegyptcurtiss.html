<hr>
<p>Did anybody ever realize a bad mistake in the proof of Curtiss
in his article "On Kellogg's Diophantine Problem", Amer. Math.
Monthly, 29 (1922), pp. 380-387?</p>

<p>I don't think so, because Richard K. Guy in his book "Unsolved
Problems in Number Theory", Springer 1994, pp. 162f., and even
Erd&ouml;s in his article "Comment on problem E2427", Amer. Math.
Monthly, 81 (1974), pp. 780-782, not only cite Curtiss' article in
their bibliography but also mention in their text explicitly him to
have proved the result.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the subject</h2>

<p>By Kellogg was the question raised, what the greatest
denominater in a representation of 1 as a sum of k unit-fractions
of integers (1 = sum<sup>k</sup><sub>n=1</sub> 1/x<sub>n</sub>) is.
He conjectured for the maximum of the x<sub>n</sub>: x<sub>1</sub>
= 1, x<sub>k+1</sub> = x<sub>k</sub> (x<sub>k</sub> + 1). This
result was "proved" by Curtiss.</p>

<p>The mistake mentioned below is just concerning the proof and not
the theorems of Curtiss, because Takenouchi in his article "On an
Indeterminate Equation", Proc. of the Physico-Mathematical Society
of Japan, 3rd series, vol. 3, pp. 78-92, proved something similar.
Also Erd&ouml;s in his article mentioned above says that he has
proved a generalization of the theorem in his Hungrian article "On
a Diophantine Equation", Mat. Lapok, 1 (1950), pp. 192-210.</p>

<p>To prove the theorem by the methods introduced by Curtiss one
need (as I think and as I did) a lot more space than he did.</p>

<h2>The "proof" of the mistake</h2>

<p>To understand the following you have to have the original
article. I use "g" instead of "\varphi".</p>

<p>The mistake is on page 385. On page 384 he states the Theorem
III. To prove the theorem he starts with <b><i>any set</i></b>
satisfying equation (11) and "shows" that a transformation by his
second method leads to a reduced set which also satisfies equation
(11). This statement is wrong: Consider the set (3,3,4), which is
obviously reduced. Thus the set (3,3) is satisfying equation (11).
By his second method he gains the set (2,6) which does not satisfy
equation (11) for f<sub>n-2</sub>(x) = 3 &lt; 6!! (He should have
taken instead the set (2,4) for g<sub>n-2</sub>(3,3) = 36 &lt; 40 =
g<sub>n-2</sub>(2,4)! Even if you consider the whole new set
(2,4,6), it is impossible to prove what he "did" that
X<sub>n-2</sub>/2 ( X<sub>n-2</sub>/2 + 1) &lt;=
f<sub>n-2</sub>(x), for 4,6 &gt; 3 = f<sub>n-2</sub>(x)! Thus the
real problem on how to gain a new set satisfying equation (11) and
increasing g<sub>n-2</sub> from any set satisfying equation (11) is
not solved by Curtiss.)</p>

<p>His mistake is in the line "But since X is compact ...". He has
<b><i>two</i></b> sets X. The original set (x<sub>1</sub>, ...
x<sub>n-1</sub>) was compact, but the shortened set (x<sub>1</sub>,
... x<sub>n-2</sub>) is **not** always compact! This is the case
with the set (3,3,4) from above.</p>

<p>Thus the Theorem III is not proven by Curtiss.</p>

<p>In the book</p>

<blockquote>Paul Erd&ouml;s &amp; Ronald L. Graham: "Old and New
Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory", <i>
L'Engseignement Mathematique Universite de Geneve</i>,
1980</blockquote>

<p>one can read on page 31:</p>

<blockquote>It is true that for any rational <i>a/b</i>, the
closest strict underapproximation <i>R<sub>n</sub>(a/b)</i> of <i>
a/b</i> by a sum of <i>n</i> unit fractions is given by 

<center><i>R<sub>n</sub>(a/b) = R</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub><i>(a/b)
+</i> 1<i>/m</i></center>

<p>where <i>m</i> is the least denominator not yet used for which
<i>R<sub>n</sub>(a/b) &lt; a/b</i>, provided that <i>n</i> is
sufficiently large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors do not give any citation of the proof of this
theorem. Does anybody know in which article it is proven or maybe
know how it can be proven?</p>

<p>In the case where the rational you are trying to approximate is
1 (one), see D. R. Curtiss, On Kellogg's diophantine problem, Amer.
Math. Monthly 29 (1922) 380--387. However, Curtiss' proof, while
entirely elementary, is not easy to follow and, according to a post
to this group earlier this year, is incorrect.</p>

<p>A simpler proof is given by O. Izhboldin and L. Kurliandchik,
Unit fractions, Proc. St. Petersburg Math. Soc. 3 (1995) 193--200.
This appears in English translation in Amer. Math. Soc.
Translations, Series 2, 166.</p>

<p>They say nothing about the general rational, and I have no
opinion as to whether their methods generalize.</p>

<p>This posting is a completion to the posting of Gerry Myerson (<a
href="mailto:gerry@mpce.mq.edu.au">gerry@mpce.mq.edu.au</a>) with
two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>correction of my former statement concerning the proof of
Curtiss and</li>

<li>explaining my strong interest in the proof for Erd&ouml;s' and
Grahams theorem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Gerry mentioned a "former posting" saying that the proof of
Curtiss is wrong. This posting was submitted to this newsgroup by
me in July. In the meantime I found out that the proof is
definitely right (but obviously difficult to understand). (Sorry
for that.) But this mistake (of me) led to a generalization of
Curtiss' theorem that has not been published elsewhere yet: The
best underapproximation of a rational <i>a/b</i> is given by the
greedy algorithm at least for the case <i>
b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;<i>a</i>. (In the case <i>
a</i>=<i>b</i>=1 this is Curtiss' theorem; in the case <i>a</i>=1
this is a statement proved by Erd&ouml;s in 1950.)</p>

<p>I was also able to prove that the methods Curtiss invented work
if and only if <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;<i>a</i>. But
there seem to be a lot more rationals for which the
underapproximation is given by the greedy algorithm. While trying
to characterize these rationals I came across the theorem of
Erd&ouml;s and Graham, which I mentioned in my first posting on
this subject.</p>

<p>Any hint on the proof of this theorem would be helpful.</p>
