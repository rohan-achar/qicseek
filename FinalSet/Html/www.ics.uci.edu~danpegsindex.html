<H1 align=center> Peg Game </H2>

<H2> Rules</H2>
<UL>
 <LI> the goal is to get a peg as high as possible
<BR> (it is possible to get as high as 8, but that is pretty hard)
<BR> a secondary goal is to minimize the number of moves to achieve
     a certain level
 <LI> initially all pegs are at level 0 or below
 <LI> a peg can move only by jumping another peg either horizontally,
      vertically, or diagonally
 <LI> the peg that was jumped over is removed
</UL>

<H2> To play</H2>
<UL>
<LI> move the cursor to be on the peg that will make the next jump
     by using the arrow keys for up, down, right, and left
<LI> make the peg jump by using the following control keys:
  <UL>
   <LI> u = jump up
   <LI> l = jump left
   <LI> r = jump right
   <LI> L = jump diagonally up-left
   <LI> R = jump diagonally up-right
   <LI> z = jump diagonally down-left
   <LI> x = jump diagonally down-right
  </UL>
<pre>
                L   u   R
                  \ | /
                l - + - r
                  /   \
                z       x
</pre>
<LI> undo the last jump by pressing the $ key
<LI> record moves made so far by pressing the ! key
    (this creates a trace file named "trace")
<LI> retrace moves made in an earlier game
     by renaming the trace file "input" and pressing the ! key
</UL>

This problem was posed by Peter Winkler of Bell Labs
in his 2002 manuscript "Five Algorithmic Puzzles".&nbsp;
He explains that this is a variation of a problem described
in <I>Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays</I>, Vol. 2,
by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy (Academic Press, 1982).
The original problem, credited by Winkler to Conway,
did not permit diagonal jumps.&nbsp;
That problem has an upper bound of level 4 achievable in 19 moves.
A <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0612612">recent paper</a>
proves the correctness of the numbers shown above.
