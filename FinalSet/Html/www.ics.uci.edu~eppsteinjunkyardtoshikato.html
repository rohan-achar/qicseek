Dear David Eppstein,

I made a geometical problem.
Please enjoy it.

Thank you,

Here is a triangle which lengths are 2, 3 and 4. Make a tetrahedron
by folding three lines.

I thought one could always fold any triangle into a tetrahedron by making 
four congruent triangles using folds through the midpoints of the edges.  Is 
there something special about 2-3-4 that allows another solution?

Can you do it by folding only three lines about 2-3-4 triangle?

Thanks for your reply.

You're right, this is a good puzzle.  I had to actually try folding some 
paper in order to understand it.

The four congruent triangle "solution" (top part of attached GIF image) 
doesn't work.  It is possible to get a tetrahedron in which each of the 
original triangle edges is doubled back along its midpoint, but it takes more 
than three folds (middle of GIF).

My solution is the bottom of the GIF.  The fold points are at the middle of 
the long edge, and 1/6 and 1/3 of the way along the middle edge.

Very good. You are right.
You are first solver.
Thank you very much.
If you have time, please find other solution.

There's more than one three-fold tetrahedron?

I did try folding it some more, and found other tetrahedra, but they need 
five, seven, or even nine folds -- see attached image.

Ok, I found it.  It is an N-shape, with vertices one unit along the length-3 
side, 1.5 units along the long side, at the obtuse vertex, and 3 units along 
the long side.  (Image attached.)

I found this by systematically going through all ways of making an N shape in 
the triangle, with one vertex of the N at a triangle vertex.  One way gave my 
previous solution, four of them led to the four folds I showed you in my 
previous message (all with more than three folds), and the sixth led to this 
solution.

By the way, there are also three infinite families of tetrahedra that can be 
folded from the triangle. if you fold two of the triangle edges in half, so 
that all three vertices meet at a point, you get a shape with one remaining 
edge (forming a continuous loop) and two interior vertices at the midpoints 
of the original triangle. The other two tetrahedron vertices can be chosen to 
be any two opposite points from the loop.  There is one solution in common to 
all three such families: the one I first sent you.  However, it seems that 
none of these possibilities uses only three folds.

I have to apologize you for my mistake.
The second one is not a solution because of non-tetrahedoron.
It seems that the problem has unique solution.

It looked like a tetrahedron when I folded it...are you sure?

I also looked like a near-flat tetrahedron at first.
Now I think that it is perfect-flat.
How are you feeling?

You are right, it is flat.
Proof:
    
    Let the triangle be ABC, with AB=2, BC=3, AC=4.
    Draw D on AC at distance 1 from A, E = midpoint(D,C), and
    F on BC at distance 2 from B.
    My proposed fold pattern was along line segments BD, BE, and EF.
    
    Then BCD is isosceles, so 2*angle(BDC)+angle(BCD)=180.
    But also angle(ADB)+angle(BDC)=180, so subtracting the two equations
    gives angle(BDC))+angle(BCD)=angle(ADB), so these three angles
    fold flat rather than making one of the corners of a tetrahedron, QED.

One can also observe that ADB is similar to ABC, BDE is isosceles,
and (since the other tetrahedron corners must also be flat) BEF is a right 
triangle. I don't know of any similar nice property for the remaining 
triangle, EFC. This construction also makes it clear that the sharp angle of 
the 2-3-4 triangle is twice that of a 1-sqrt(15)-4 right triangle, which is 
helpful if you want to calculate the angles.
