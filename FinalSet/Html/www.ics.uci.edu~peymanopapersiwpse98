This capability benefits everyone involved: theoriginal application vendor sells more product sincecustomization constitutes use; the third-party developer deliversa product in less time and with lower cost by reusing softwareinstead of starting from scratch; and the customer receives ahigher quality product in less time and with lower cost.</a></p><p><a name="1025472">Although reliable, rapid, and cost effectivesoftware evolution has been a principal concern of softwareresearch since the 1970's, results to date do not directlyaddress DSE.

Unfortunately, the flexibility attained using thesetechniques is lost when the application is compiled for use. Thecompilation process solidifies the plasticity of a design, makingit exceedingly difficult to accommodate a change that wouldotherwise be easy to make. The objective of DSE is to preservethe design's plasticity in the deployed system, thereby enablingthird-party evolution.</p><p><a name="1026808">The rest of the paper is organized asfollows.

Design tools,        such as Rational Rose, automate the diagramming process        and provide analysis support. Group communication and        collaboration tools, such as e-mail, revision control        tools, and configuration management systems, help teams        members coordinate and manage software changes.</a></dd>    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>    <dt><a name="1026054">Decentralized, design-time evolution</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1026246">Larger teams and geographic        distribution differentiate decentralized design-time        evolution from its centralized counterpart. The impact of        large teams on software engineering environments has been        discussed by Perry and Kaiser [</a><a href="#1023864">14</a>].        They argue that as a project grows above approximately 20        people, the number and complexity of interactions        increases. As a consequence, additional rules and        mechanisms that enforce cooperation among personnel are        needed. Less well understood is the impact of geographic        distribution on software development. Fielding and Kaiser        [<a href="#1027767">5</a>] describe the processes and        tools adopted by one particular globally distributed team        that develops the Apache Web server.

Since evolution is done by a single        authority, change conflicts do not arise. As a result,        most technologies are concerned with the efficient        distribution of upgrades. The most common technology in        use today is the binary patch file, which encodes the        byte-level changes necessary to upgrade an application to        a subsequent release. More sophisticated tools, such as        Tivoli's TME/10 [</a><a href="#1026279">20</a>] and        SoftwareDock [<a href="#1007962">8</a>], use software        dependency information to guide software upgrades.</dd></dl><dl>    <dt><a name="1024239">Decentralized, post-deployment        evolution</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1026333">Multiple software vendors independently        evolving a deployed application is represented by this        category. The most popular techniques include software        plug-ins, which are used by Netscape's Communicator to        support new content types, and scripting languages. There        are a host of issues and consequences inherent in        supporting this type of evolution. For example,        configuration management becomes necessary if conflicts        between independently developed software add-ons can        occur. Since applications are evolved in-the-field,        anomalies may arise from unforeseen interactions between        independently developed add-ons. Consequentially,        application consistency must be verified whenever the        application is modified (i.e., when add-ons are installed        or removed). Software add-on vendors must also use        standard formats for packaging and distributing add-ons.        Furthermore, decentralized control over software        evolution complicates product support and documentation        since no single authority represents an application that        has been evolved by multiple vendors. End-user        installation of software add-ons necessitates that        configuration management and analysis be robust and        accessible to non-technical users.

Although this is rare in the commercial softwaremarket, numerous free-ware applications adopt this approach,including the Linux OS, the Apache Web server, and the GNU tools(e.g., gcc, emacs). Netscape's Communicator is among the firstcommercial products to distribute source code for independentextension. Although the types of changes that can be made areunrestricted, it is extremely difficult to combine independentlydeveloped add-ons. This is because determining whether or not twochanges conflict requires careful analysis of the source code andcannot be automated. The problem is analogous to merging severalbranches of a software revision tree in a software configurationmanagement system.</p><p><a name="1022708">At the extreme right of the spectrum, thesoftware vendor deploys the application as a monolithic entity,with a fixed set of user-selection options. A large majority ofcommercial software applications adopt this approach because (1)application consistency may be assured since a single softwarevendor has exclusive control over its evolution, and (2) asoftware vendor can protect their intellectual property rights bymaking it extraordinarily difficult for others to reverseengineer the application. </a></p><p><a name="1022709">Applications in between these two extremessupport some form of software evolution by trading-off assuredconsistency (right-end) for flexibility (left-end). These systemsenable end-users or third-party software vendors to customize orextend the application's functionality independent of theoriginal application vendor. A relatively small but growingnumber of software applications lay between these two extremes.Some examples include Microsoft's Office Suite, Adobe Photoshop,and Qualcomm's Eudora. The most common techniques for supportingDSE are briefly described below.</a></p><dl>    <dt><a name="1022844">Application Programming Interfaces        (APIs)</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1022845">An API is a set of functions that an        application provides for other applications. APIs are        commonly used as tool integration mechanisms since they        enable other applications to invoke the services of the        host application without user involvement. APIs provide a        limited subset of the operations necessary to support        evolution. For example, API-based software add-ons cannot        replace or remove existing functionality, or interpose        new functionality between existing parts. As a        consequence, the host application's predetermined API        circumscribes the class of possible changes.</a></dd>    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>    <dt><a name="1022716">Software plug-ins</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1022717">The plug-in mechanism provides a place        holder for third-party components. The host application        specifies the requirements and functional interface that        all plug-ins must adhere to, and provides a mechanism by        which new plug-ins register themselves with the host.        Netscape's Communicator, for example, registers plug-ins        by placing them in a special file system directory        queried on startup. The host application selects among        the plug-ins and invokes them as necessary. Plug-in based        software add-ons can only provide alternative        implementations for behaviors anticipated by the original        developers. The interposition and removal of        functionality is not supported since dependency        information between plug-ins cannot be determined.</a></dd>    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>    <dt><a name="1021986">Scripting languages &amp; macros</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1022718">A scripting language provides a        domain-specific language for specifying behavior using        language primitives and library functions. Scripting        language-based mechanisms provide essentially the same        flexibility as the API mechanism, except that the        scripting language provides domain-specific language        constructs that can facilitate the implementation of        add-ons, and a built-in compiler and interpreter that        lower the entry barrier for developing add-ons.</a></dd>    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>    <dt><a name="1024812">Dynamic link libraries (DLLs)</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1025037">Dynamic link libraries provide a        late-binding mechanism whereby an application can load        and link to an external software module during runtime.        Applications employ DLLs to reduce runtime memory use and        to share common functionality. A software add-on can        augment, replace, or remove functionality by masquerading        as an application DLL (e.g., by replacing the file        representing the DLL in the file system). Balzer's        instrumented connector technology [</a><a href="#1024998">1</a>]        use this technique to alter Netscape's Communicator        browser to support browsing of virtual, encrypted file        systems. Although DLL-based software add-ons are unique        in that they can be used to evolve an application in a        manner unanticipated by its developers, they have two        limitations. One, DLL add-ons can only be use in place of        existing DLLs, which circumscribes the class of changes.        Two, unexpected side-effects may result if the add-on DLL        violates an unstated assumption between the application        and the DLL. </dd></dl><dl>    <dt><a name="1024822">Component-based applications</a></dt>    <dd><a name="1024825">Component-based applications built        using a component-object model, such as COM [</a><a        href="#1000156">3</a>] or CORBA [<a href="#1000034">11</a>],        are applications composed of separately compiled modules,        called components, that are linked to one another during        runtime. Since each application component exposes its        interface, component-based applications expose a richer,        more structured API, increasing the potential of        supporting unanticipated changes. But since existing        technologies do not try to separation application        functionality from component communication, components        tend to be riddled with hard-coded references to other        components. This makes component replacement, removal,        and interposition of behavior difficult.</dd></dl><p><a name="1027013">All of the these techniques, except forsource code, generally preserve only a small portion of thedesign's flexibility in the deployed system. Not only does thisrestrict the set of potential changes, but it precludes changesunanticipated by the original developers. Composition of softwareadd-ons is also poorly supported by existing techniques. Mostexisting techniques circumvent the composition problem bypreventing interaction between add-ons. This is indeed theapproach advocated by Szyperski [</a><a href="#1022830">18</a>].</p><h2><a name="1027014">Our Approach</a></h2><p><a name="1028617">Our approach to decentralized,post-deployment software evolution overcomes many of thelimitations exhibited by previous approaches. Our approach isbased on evolving applications at the softwarearchitectural-level [</a><a href="#1023862">15</a>,<ahref="#1008089">16</a>]. Our approach to DSE is unique infollowing ways:</p><p><a name="1028789">We augment the abstractions provided at thearchitectural level with stylist rules that further facilitateDSE. We require all components to communicate through connectors,which are preserved as explicit entities in the implementationand act as communication routers. Furthermore, connectorsencapsulate and localize the binding decisions betweencomponents, which makes it possible to change binding decisionswithout altering the components. </a></p><p><a name="1029165">We include the application's architecturalmodel and a mechanism to maintain the consistency between thismodel and the implementation with the deployed system. Thedeployed architectural model describes the interconnectionsbetween components and connectors, and their mappings toimplementation modules. The mapping enables changes specified interms of the architectural model to effect corresponding changesin the implementation. </a></p><p><a name="1029166">We deploy an architecture evolution manager(AEM) with the application. The AEM maintains the correspondencebetween the architectural model and the implementation as changesare made. If a change violates application consistency, the AEMcan reject the change.</a></p><p><a name="1028861">Our approach enables software add-ons toleverage the architectural model's rich semantics to guidechanges. This avoids many of the accidental difficulties incurredby existing approaches. Since the application's entirearchitecture is exposed and remains malleable in the deployedsystem, the design's plasticity is preserved and made accessiblyto third-party add-on vendors. This overcomes the limited scopeof change exhibited by existing approaches. Software add-ons caninspect and modify the system's architectural model in order toachieve the necessary semantics. This, for example, greatlysimplifies the problem of interposing a new component between twoexisting components since the architectural model can be queriedto locate the affected components and connectors. Asindependently developed software add-ons are installed andremoved, the architectural model can be analyzed to detectinconsistencies. The availability of the architectural model canalso be used to detect conflicts between independently developedadd-ons. </a></p><h2><a name="1022093">Results to Date</a></h2><p><a name="1029437">We have implemented a prototype tool suite,called ArchStudio, that implements our approach for applicationsimplemented in the C2 architectural style [</a><a href="#1029595">19</a>].ArchStudio's conceptual architecture is depicted and brieflydescribed in Figure 2.</p><div align="center"><center><table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">    <tr>        <td width="50%"><p align="center"><img        src="ArchStudio.gif" width="500" height="418"></p>        </td>        <td width="50%"><strong>Figure 2</strong>: A conceptual        architecture of the ArchStudio tool suite.

When the user selects the file representing the add-on,the Web browser downloads the file and invokes the ExtensionWizard. The software add-on file is a compressed archivecontaining new implementation modules and an installation script.The Extension Wizard uncompresses the file, locates theinstallation script it contains, and executes it. The softwareadd-on's installation script may query and modify thearchitectural model as necessary. The installation script anexception if the AEM detects a violation of applicationinvariants. If the installation succeeds, the Extension Wizardnotifies the end-user and provides an option to un-install theadd-on.</a></p><h2><a name="1021446">C</a>onclusions</h2><p><a name="1029579">Our results to date are encouraging, butseveral difficult issues remain. A general framework for ensuringapplication consistency is needed. Our current architectureevolution manager only enforces C2-style rules, which do not, bythemselves, guarantee that changes will leave the application ina consistent state. Some aspects of the style do facilitate thistype of in-the-field analysis. We are currently investigating thesuitability of graph grammars, architectural constraints, andevent-based resource models for representing applicationinvariants. While these techniques hope to address softwarecompositionality, new techniques are needed to address theproblems of ``composing'' documentation and product support in adecentralized environment.</a></p><h2><a name="1025419">R</a>eferences</h2><ol>    <li><a name="1024998">R.
