Versioning is the fundamental basis of documentmanagement systems, with far reaching effects on the semantics of documentidentity and meaningful operations.  These requirements reflectthe basic versioning needs for document management and collaborativeauthoring.  It does not define the complete set of requirements for thesedomains where they extend beyond the versioning of resources.</P><h2>1. Introduction</h2><P>This document discusses why versioning is needed on the WWW, and thefunctional requirements for full version support.  We have divided therequirements in three sections.  This discussion enumerates the reqirementsfor implementing such functionality as a first step to creating aspecification that will address these needs.<p>We first briefly describe the rationale for versioning on the web inSection 2.  This rationale enumerates the goals of versioning on the WWW.All specific requirements should support (and certainly should not hinder)the realization of the goals.  Section 3 contains global requirements forprotocol development.  These are things we think are technically justifiedand that fulfil the rationale.  They are separated from the otherrequirements because their acceptance creates further constraints on othertechnical requirements.  Finally, In Section 4, we specific functionalrequirements based on the foundation established in the earlier sections.<p>We have based this effort on David Fiander's suggestion to separateversioning and configuration requirements, and we assume a two-layerarchitecture for versioning on the web.  The first layer, whoserequirements are defined in this document, will address the simple problemof <EM>handling multiple versions of single resources.</EM> The secondlayer will address the thornier problems of configuration management formultiple resources.  This layering simplifies both discussion and design.<H2>2. Rationale</H2><P>Versioning in the context of the world-wide web offers a variety ofbenefits:</P><ol><LI>It provides infrastructure for efficient and controlledmanagement of large evolving web sites.<br><br>Modern configuration management systems are built on some form ofrepository that can track the revision history of individual resources, andprovide the higher-levelools to manage those saved versions. Basicversioning capabilities are required to support such systems.</li><LI>It allows parallel development and update of single resources<br><br>Since versioning systems register change by creating new objects, theyenable simultaneous write access by allowing the creation of variantversions. Many also provide merge support to ease the revers operation.</LI><LI>It provides a framework for access control over resources.<br><br>While specifics vary, most systems provide some method ofcontrolling ortracking access to enable collaborative resource development.</LI><LI>It allows browsing through past and alternative versions of aresource<br><br>Frequently the modification and authorship history of a resource iscritical information in itself.</LI><LI>It provides stable names that can support externally stored links forannotation and link-server support.<br><br>Both annotation and link servers frequently need to store stablereferences to portions of resources that are not under their directcontrol. By providing stable states of resources, version control systemsallow not only stable pointers into those resources, but also well-definedmethods to determine the relationships of those states of a resource.</LI><LI>It allows explicit semantic representation of single resources withmultiple states<br><br>A versioning system directly represents the fact that a resourcehas anexplicit history, and a persistent identity across the various states ithas had during the course of that history.</LI></ol><H2>3. Global requirements</H2><P>This section covers the overarching contraints that mustinform and direct detailed requirements for versioning support.  Theyencompass compatibility across different implementations, as well ascompatibility with current practice.  Therefore, we believe the followingto be the general requirements for WWW versioning:</P><ol><LI><EM>Stableness of versions.</EM><br>Most versioning systems are intended to enable an accurate record of thehistory of evolution of a document.  This accuracy is ensured by the factthat a version eventually becomes "frozen" and immutable.  Once a versionis frozen, further changes will create new versions rather than modifyingthe original.  In order for caching and persistent references to beproperly maintained, a client must be able to determine that a version hasbeen frozen.  We require that unlocked resource versions be frozen.  Thisenables the common practice of keeping unfrozen "working versions".  Anysuccessful attempt to retrieve a frozen version of a resource will alwaysretrieve exactly the same content, or return an error if that version (orthe resource itself) are no longer available.  Since URLs may bereassigned at a server's discretion this requirement applies only for thatperiod of time during which a URL identifies the same resource.</li><br><LI><EM>User Agent Interoperability.</EM><br>All versioning-aware user agents should be able to work with anyversioning-aware HTTP server.  It is acceptable for some user agent/servercombinations to provide special features that are not universallyavailable, but the protocol should be sufficient that a basic level offunctionality will be universal.</li><li><em>Style-free Versioning</em><br>The protocol should not unnecessarily restrict version management style toany one paradigm.  For instance, locking and version number assignmentshould be interoperable across servers and clients, even if there are somedifferences in their preferred models.<LI><em>Separation of access to resources and access control</em><br>The protocol must separate the reservation and release of versionedresources from their access methods.  Provided that consistency constraintsare met before, during and after the modification of a versioned resource,no "right way" to access to a resource is enforced by the protocol.  Forinstance, a user may request declare an intention to write after a GET, mayPOST a resource without releasing the lock, and might even request a lockvia HTTP connection while getting the document via FTP.</LI><LI><EM>Legacy Resource Support.</EM><br>The protocol should enable a versioning aware server to work with existingresources and URLs.  Special versioning information should not become amandatory part of HTTP protocols except where it is required.  Specialversion information that would break existing clients and servers, such as newmandatory headers, cannot therefore be required for GET (and possibly also forPUT).</LI><LI><EM>Legacy User Agent Support.</EM><br>Servers should make versioned resources accessible to versioning-unawareuser-agents in a format acceptable to them.</LI><li><EM>Specific named version URLs that are constructed from a URLand an opaque version string</EM><br>Because the notation will be required to operate in the version controlenvironment preferred by the website maintainer, it must be able toproperly contain arbitrary strings, which may be used by the VCS as versionidentifiers.  While version information may be intelligible to the humanoperator, and perhaps to special-purpose clients, the client must beable to treat the version specifier as a black box.</li></ol><H2>4. Functional requirements</H2><p>The following functional reqirements are intended to satisfy the globalrequirements of Section 3 and enable the benefits listed in Section 2.  Themention of possible new HTTP methods is intended to make the discussionclearer and more concrete, not to rule out other methods of meeting therequirements.<P>The protocol should provide:</P><ol><LI><em>Access to specific named versions via a URL</em><br>This is required for version-specific linking, and for legacy user-agentsupport.</li><li><em>A URL to denote a versioned resource itself, rather than specificversions of it</em><br>This is more important if URL computations are not allowed, since anidentifier is needed for queries about the versioning status of a resource.This is used to perform operations (such as adjusting attributes, changinglocks, or reassigning URLs) that affect all versions of a resource, ratherthan any specific version.</li><LI><EM>Direct access to a server-defined "default", "current" or "tip" versionof a resource</EM><br>This is one of the simplest ways to guarantee legacy user-agentcompatibility and legacy file compatibility.  If no special version URLsare used, the server will provide a default.  This does not rule out thepossibility of a server returning an error in case no such default exists.</LI><LI><em>A way to access common related URLs from a versioned URL,</em>whether byserver query, URL computation, or some other way:<UL><LI>root version(s) of this document</LI><LI>predecessor version(s) of this document</LI><LI>successor version(s) of this document</LI><LI>default version of this document</LI></UL>Some versions of a resource are special.  It must be possible in some wayfor a versioning-aware client to access common related versions to the oneit currently is displaying.  Possible solutions include, but are notlimited to: the server automatically adding header fields to a versionedURL specifying the URL of the common related versions, the server providingone or more query methods ("who is the previous version to this URL?"), ora standardized way to compute related URLs when given a versioned URL. Wefeel that access to the "default" version of a resource is an extremelyimportant operation, that a browser should be able to perform at any timethat a versioned URL is seen.</strong></LI><LI><EM>A way to retrieve the complete version topology for this resource</EM><br>There should be a way to retrieve information about all versions of aresource.  The format for this information must be standardized so that thebasic information can be used by all clients.  </LI><LI><EM>Some way to determine that aURL points to a named version of a resource</EM><br>This might be implemented as part of the URL format, a server query oradditional headers.</li><li><EM>Some way to determine a version identification and a resourceidentification for a versioned resource, given its URL</EM><br>This requirement describe the ability to take the URL of a version of aresource and determine:<ul><li>a URL for the resource</li><li>a version identifier for the resource.</li></ul>Note that this kind of facility supports only some comparison operations: Itenables the determination that two version-containing URLs designateversions of the same resource.  However, given the phenomenon of URLaliasing, it is insufficient to determine that they are <EM>not</EM>versions of the same resource.<br><br>This is sort of a minimal "browsingthrough time" requirement.  Tthis requirement allows a browser to tell that aversioned resource has been accessed and then to invoke special versioningor configuration management operations on the resource.  While clientperformance will be best if this can be done via URL computation (ie.mangling) it could also be done by an extra query and round-trip tothe server.</LI><LI><EM>A way to request exclusive access to a version of a resource(LOCK)</EM><br>Since not all systems implement lock-based access there is aquestion as how this should be implemented. Client use of thismethod could be optional, allowing some relatively strong guarantee on themeaning of acquiring a lock.  Alternatively, clients could be expected totake a lock, but servers might implement different locking policies(possible even including implementation of LOCK and UNLOCK as NOPS).</LI><li><EM>A way to specify a timeout after which a lock will lapse</EM><br>In many cases, locks over a certain duration are due to errors, and theirstrict enforcement can cause more problems than inadvertent version skew.We should allow locks to have a lifetime.  It <EM>may</EM> prove a good idea tohave a finite default lifetime defined by the protocol.  If a universaldefault is too constraining, there should be a way for a server to informthe client what the lifetime of a lock is.  Servers should honor clientlock lifetime requests, or inform them if the request is denied.<LI><EM>A way to release exclusive acccess to a resource (UNLOCK)</EM><br>This is the inverse of LOCK.</LI><li><em>A way for a client to declare an intention to modify a resource(RESERVE or CHECKOUT?)</em><br>This operation is required before any versioned update.  Its effects mayvary depending on server policy, from locking a resource, to forking a newvariant, to a NOP on servers that do not track sessions or restrictupdates.  If this operation returns a version number, the client isrequired to make sure that it uses a copy of the data associated with thatversion number of the resource for any update operations it carries out.Servers that wish to enforce a mandatory GET operation before update, shouldsimply use a fresh version identifier on the return from this operation.</li><li><em>A way to declare the end of an intention to write a resource</em><br>This is the inverse of RESERVE.  Typically, servers will commitupdates at this time, and return a final version identifier if possibleand if it was not already returned.</li><LI><EM>A way to submit a new version of a resource (PUT)</EM><br>The server should be able to attach it to the correct part of the versiontree, based on the version number associated with the resource before itsmodification.</li><LI><em>A way for a user-agent to request a version identifier for a checkedout version.</em><br>Such an identifier will not be used by any otheruser-agent in the meantime.  The server may refuse the request.</LI><li><EM>A way for a client to propose a version identifier uponsubmitting a version of a resource</EM><br>The server may refuse to to use the client's suggested version identifier.</LI><li><em>A way for a Client to supply metatdata to be associated with aversion</em><br>The kinds of data supplied here might be simple textual comments or morestructured data.  An ability to attach aritrary fields and content isprobably required, but a standard set of attributes that would enableinteroperation would be useful.  For basic versioning we need only specify,for example, that comments are attached as the message-body of the operationthat releases a write intention.  The special formats for structured metadatacan then be handled by using content-type negotiation, and thecontent-types defined as part of the Configuration Management layer.</li><li><em>A way for a server to provide a version identifier to be used for aresource in further operations/</em><br>This general requirement notes that version aware clients are responsiblefor providing the appropriate version identifier for a resource that isbeing manipulated.  In particular, if a resource is being modified, anyserver provided version must be used when submitting an update.  Thisallows servers to track active sessions (however they may be implemented bythe server) by assigning version identifiers when documents are retrieved,locked, or reserved.</li></ol><p>The following discussion of possible implementations of the requirementsabove is intended to aid understanding of the requirements.  It is<em>not</em> a statement that a particular implementation is a requirementfor basic versioning, but an explanation of how the separation of concernsmight improve the final implementation architecture.<p>The requirements on reservation and PUT take care some key globalrequirements: version access is logically separated from access control(RESERVE/RELEASE) and updating.  In terms of traditional CM, a CHECKOUT is aRESERVE followed by a GET and a CHECKIN is a PUT followed by an RELEASE.  Byseparating access control (locking and unlocking of resources) frommodification of resources, we achieve a great deal of versioning-styleindependence.<p>We also have very flexible options for the negotiation ofversion identifiers depending on server policy.  The version identifier of anew resource can be negotiated between the user-agent and the server at 3points in time: when a lock is taken, when the lock is released, or whenthe resource is POSTed.  Session tracking can be implemented by usingspecial version identifiers for RESERVE and RELEASE.  All versionidentifier negotiation follows a simple rule: "the client proposes, but theserver disposes."<h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>This document is a result of the vigorous and valuable discussion on theVersioning on the Web <A HREF="mailto:www-vers-wg-request@ics.uci.edu">&lt;www-vers-wg-request@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A>, and the Distributed Authoring<AHREF="mailto:w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org">&lt;w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org&gt;</A>mailing lists.
