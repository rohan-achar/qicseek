<H1><A HREF="index.html">Replicators</A>: B36/S23 (HighLife)</H1>

This near-relative of Conway's Life was the first interesting rule in
which a replicator was discovered, by Nathan Thompson in 1994.
The replicator (shown in its symmetric phase) operates in a
one-dimensional diagonal 2-unit grid, replicating itself every 12 generations.

Rows of replicators can be capped off by blocks or eaters, resulting in
arbitrarily high-period oscillators.

Since HighLife is so similar to life, it has
<A HREF="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b36s23/">many
of the same spaceships</A>, including the small c/4 diagonal glider.
An alternate method of capping a row of replicators produces glider guns
of arbitrarily high periods.

Another method of capping a row of replicators, by a single
blinker, produces a spaceship known as the <I>bomber.</I>
The bomber moves diagonally 4 positions every 24 generations,
after which a blinker appears in the same position on the other side
of the bomber.

SRC="b36s23-bomber.gif" WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=51 ALT="HighLife bomber"></A></DIV></P>

Two side-by-side bombers can form puffers such as these two rakes,
which leave sideways- and backwards-going trails of gliders.

<A HREF="b36s23-back-rake.lif"><IMG SRC="b36s23-back-rake.gif" WIDTH=87
HEIGHT=83 ALT="HighLife backwards rake"></A></DIV></P>

Dirtier puffers, spewing irregular patterns of blinkers and biloafs,
can be formed by capping a row of replicators in yet another way.

WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=163 ALT="HighLife p96 puffer"></A></DIV></P>

It's even possible for a puffer based on a bomber and replicator to spew
out a trail of rows of replicators.  Each row copies itself
perpendicularly to the motion of the puffer.  The pattern evolves to
form a large 
<A HREF="/~eppstein/junkyard/sierpinski.html">Sierpinski triangle</A>
filled with replicators.  The growth rate of the pattern
(number of live cells after n generations) is O(n<sup>log<sub>2</sub>3</sup>),
where the exponent is the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski triangle.

It's possible to use replicator-based oscillators to make a gun
that periodically shoots bombers

SRC="b36s23-bombgun.gif" WIDTH=219 HEIGHT=383 ALT="HighLife p192 bomber gun"></A></DIV></P>

or a "breeder" that shoots sideways glider rakes, producing a quadratic
growth rate.

Finally, Dean Hickerson has found a "<A HREF="b36s23-push.lif">push
reaction</A>" in which two sets of replicators push a blinker forward
eight units diagonally.  Since the bomber reaction allows replicators to
pull a blinker the same amount, it should be possible to set up
arbitrarily-slow replicator-based spaceships in which two sets of
replicators push a blinker at the front end, and each pull a blinker at
the other end.  <s>However, the likely size of these things is so huge
(exponential in the period, leading to a pattern size of around
2<sup>36</sup> replicator units for Dean's reaction with the shortest
possible repeat time) that no explicit example has been made.</s>
ETA January 2013: After the discovery of better reactions, Adam Goucher,
Helmut Postl, and others have
explicitly constructed "basilisks", spaceships of this type, with speeds c/24, c/32,
c/63, and c/69. In principle infinitely
many other speeds should also be possible. Goucher even constructed a
basilisk gun, for the c/24 basilisk.
