			<p align = "justify">
				In this paper we evaluate several in-memory algorithms for efficient and 
				scalable processing of continuous range queries over collections of moving 
				objects. Constant updates to the index are avoided by query indexing. No 
				constraints are imposed on the speed or path of moving objects or fraction of 
				objects that move at any moment in time. We present a detailed analysis of a 
				grid approach which shows the best results for both skewed and uniform data. A 
				sorting based optimization is developed for significantly improving the cache 
				hit-rate. Experimental evaluation establishes that indexing queries using the 
				grid index yields orders of magnitude better performance than other index 
				structures such as R*-trees.
