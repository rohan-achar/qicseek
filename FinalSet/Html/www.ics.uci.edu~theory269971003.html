<h2>3 October 1997:<br>
Quadrilateral Meshing by Circle Packing<br>
<a href="/~eppstein/">David Eppstein</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>We use circle-packing methods to generate quadrilateral meshes
for polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality
and the number of elements. We show that these methods can generate
meshes of several types:</p>

<ol>
<li>the elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,</li>

<li>all elements have two opposite 90-degree angles</li>

<li>all elements are kites, or</li>

<li>all angles are at most 120 degrees.</li>
</ol>

In each case the total number of elements is O(<i>n</i>), where <i>
n</i> is the number of input vertices.
