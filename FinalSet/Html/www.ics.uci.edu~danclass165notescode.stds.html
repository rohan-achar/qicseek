<H2> Coding Standards </H2>

The following coding standards were used for an earlier
course.&nbsp;
You are not obligated to use these standards,
but you should develop and maintain <I>some</I>
reasonable set of standards and stick with them.
<P>

<OL>
<LI> Each source module will contain at most ten procedures
     of similar function (as indicated by the module name).&nbsp;
     The procedures within a module must be separated by
     several blank lines.
<LI> Each procedure will contain a header comment
     identifying the procedure by name and function.
<LI> Each procedure will contain at most 100 lines of executable code,
     not counting comments or declarations.
<LI>
Use variable names which are meaningful.
<LI> No comment will continue across line boundaries.&nbsp;
     Close the comment at the end of a line and open it again
     on the next line.
<LI> At most one statement will occur on a line.&nbsp;
     If a statement spans several lines,
     it will be indented in a consistent fashion
     (to indicate continuation).
<LI> Blank lines and extra spaces will be used freely to increase 
     readability.&nbsp;
     In particular, the assignment operator (<tt>=</tt>) will
     <I>always</I> be enclosed in spaces.&nbsp;
     Use parentheses for clarity.
<LI> The use of the GOTO statement is very strongly discouraged.
<LI> No string constant will be split between two lines.
<LI> No code may succeed a `<tt>{</tt>' nor precede a `<tt>}</tt>'
     on a line.
<LI> All programs will be indented in the following manner:
     <UL>
       <LI> Each `<tt>}</tt>' will be in the same column as
            the beginning of the text of the line containing
            the `<tt>{</tt>' that it closes.
       <LI> In an <I>if-then-else</I> construct,
            the <I>else</I> will start in the same column as
            the <I>if</I>.
       <LI> Statements immediately contained within a bracketed pair
            will all start in the same column, and that column will be 
            indented consistently to the right of the bracketing
            statement's starting column by two to five spaces.&nbsp;
            Note that, of course, the contents between the bracketing
            statements will have to be indented with respect to the
            outer indentation.&nbsp;  For example,
<BR>
<pre>
	if (x == 5) {
	     y = 7;
	     printf("x is five\n");
	}
	else {
	     y = 10;
	     printf("x is not five\n");
	}
</pre>
     </UL>
</OL>
