<p>

This presentation describes the Practical Software Measurement (PSM) 
approach. PSM is sponsored by the Office of Undersecretary of Defense 
for Acquisition & Technology (OUSD A&T). The goal of the project is to 
provide program managers with the objective information needed to 
successfully meet cost, schedule, and technical objectives. 

<p>

The PSM process
<ul>
<li>is based on actual software measurement experience on DoD, Government, 
and industry programs 

<li>treats measurement as a flexible process not a pre-defined list of 
graphs or reports 

<li>integrates the measurement requirements into the developers process 

<li>defines an issue-driven analysis approach which helps the program 
manager make informed decisions 

<li>supports the current software acquisition and measurement 
policy and provides a basis for enterprise level software measurement.
</li></ul>

<p>

The PSM team produced and deployed a guidebook, training, tools, 
workshops, and a cooperative transition approach that is currently 
being used by DoD, Government and industry.
