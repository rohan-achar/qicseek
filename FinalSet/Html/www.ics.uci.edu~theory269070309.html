<h1>
Entropy Coding
</h1>

<h2>Josiah Carlson, UCI</h2>

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
In this survey talk we will offer an introduction with brief
explanations of historic entropy coders; from the symbol-based
Shannon, Huffman, and Arithmetic approaches, to the "modern" LZ77, 78, and LZW
pattern matching algorithms.  With luck, we will have time to discuss
data transformation approaches with FFT/DCT and BWT. In this survey
