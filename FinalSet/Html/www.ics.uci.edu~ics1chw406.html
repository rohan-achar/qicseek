<H1>Current Techniques For Earthquake Prediction</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<pre>
	Earthquakes are one of our oldest enemies, but it has not
been until recently that we have been able to understand what they
are and how they are caused.  One of the reasons why they are so
feared is they because of their apparent randomness.  Earthquakes
are powerful, but more intimidating is their invisibility, for
they seem to appear out of nowhere.  Ironically, earthquakes are
only disasterous if they have struck a populated area.  By
themselves, they are nature's what of releasing built up energy.
Data collected at the <A 
HREF="http://info.er.usgs.gov/data/geologic/neic/lists/Frequency.html#TABLE4">U.S. Geological Survey Center</A>
states that an earthquake with a onemagnitude change creates 10 times
more ground motion and releases 32 times more energy. One of the obvious
methods to reduce the loss of life and injury caused by earthquakes is to 
be able to predict the earthquake before it arrives.  In this research 
paper, I will attempt to outline some of the long-term, 
short-term, and instantaneous earthquake prediction techniques.  
</pre>

<H2>Long-Term Prediction Techniques</H2>
<pre>
	The long-term goals of earthquake prediction allows us to
determine the possiblity of an earthquake years before it strikes. 
However, earthquakes are extremely large-scale phenomenas that exist in
3-D space within the earth's <A 
HREF="http://www.geophys.washington.edu/FAC/k_creager.html">mantle</a>.
	This makes it exceedingly difficult to predict in the long-run. 
Fortunately, however, earthquakes do have patterns, and these patterns are
what increases our chances of a successful prediction.
</pre>
<UL>
<LI>Statistical Return Periods<p>
	One way to help predict earthquakes is through statistical return
periods.  For example, the <A
HREF="http://scec.gps.caltech.edu/">Department of Geophysics</a> at
Caltech keeps track of all earthquakes in California, whether they are
minor or major.  By studying earthquake reoccurence at the same
approximate location over a long period of time, we might be able to
reasonably predict when another earthquake will occur.  For this method to
be effective, we must have a long and accurate historical record.
</p>
<LI>Earthquake Characteristics
<p>
	In addition to studying the frequency of certain earthquakes,
scientists can also study its characteristics.  Seismologists <A
HREF="http://www.geophys.washington.edu/FAC/r_crosson.html">Robert S.
Crosson</a> and <A
HREF="http://www.geophys.washington.edu/FAC/s_malone.html">Stephen D. 
Malone</a> at the <A
HREF="http://jinni.geophys.washington.edu/">Department of Geophysics
at the University of Washington</a> work in conjunction with the <A
HREF="http://www.geophys.washington.edu/pnsn.html">Pacific Northwest
Seismograph Network</a> to help determine the structure of earthquakes. 
The PNSN is a collection of more than a hundred various seismic stations
surrounding the Pacific Northwest.  Armed with sophisticated equipment,
seismologists can retreive real-time detection data from an occuring
earthquake.  By collecting data from a broad area during an earthquake, we
can learn more about its motional characteristics.  These motional 
characteristics may, in the future, help us to predict when and where an 
earthquake will appear.

<H2>Short-Term Prediction Techniques</H2>

<pre>
	While long-term predictions are on the order of years and decades,
short-term predictions are on the order of days and possibly, hours.
</pre>
<UL>
<LI>Precursory Phenomena
<p>

	One way to predict an earthquake is through precursory phenomena. 
Examples include dropping water levels in wells, peculiar animal behavior,
and even strange glows in the sky.  While there are no scientific
explanations for these occurences, very high stresses in rocks produce
heat, cause deformation of rocks, releases gases, and other geomagnetic
effects.  It is highly possible that these effects can alternate the
normal surface of the earth.
</p>

<LI>Foreshocks
<p>

	Another possible indicator of a upcoming earthquake is the
occurence of <A
HREF="http://www.seismo.unr.edu/Perminfo/question_answer.html">foreshocks</a>,
or small earthquakes before a main shock.  In the <A
HREF="http://www.seismo.unr.edu/Perminfo/question_answer.html">Questions
and Answer On Earthquakes</a> at the <A
HREF="http://www.seismo.unr.edu/index.html">University of Nevada, Reno
Seismological Laboratory</a>, the chance of another earthquake the same
size or larger than the previous quake is 6%. As time passes, that
percentage drops.  This method od prediction lies on the fact that the
earth's core releases pressure in small packets before the main rupture. 
A single earthquake has a low probability of leading to a larger quake,
but several small earthquakes in an area identified as a seismic gap can
increase the probability.
</p>
</UL>
<H2>Instantaneous Prediction Techniques</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Alarm Systems
<p>
	Scientists have also been able to predict an earthquake within
seconds of its occurence.  Unfortunately, the only sure way to predict an
earthquake is after it has happened.  Fortunately, however, in a number of
cases, the danger of an earthquake comes from the shock waves arriving
from an earthquake with its epicenter some distance away.  In these cases,
it is possible to set up an alarm system that can warn neighboring cities
before the shock waves arrive.  The 20 or 30 seconds warning can allow
factories, power stations, and other mechanical operations to be safely
shut down.  Most of the damage from an earthquake comes from the fires
proceeding the quake.  With this system, potentially dangerous fires can
be minimized by shutting down all energy-intensive operations. 
</p>
</UL>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<pre>
	Given the nature of an earthquake occurence, it is
unlikely that we will ever be able to predict earthquakes with
100% accuracy.  However, by aggregating the signs from various
sources such as surface deformation, previous statistics, earthquake
motion data, and precurosry phenomena, we can increase the probability
of a successful prediction.
