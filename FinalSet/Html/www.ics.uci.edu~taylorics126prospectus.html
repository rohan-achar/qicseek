Prospectus</H1></CENTER>
As has been discussed in class, you have substantial flexibility in choosing
the specific form for the content of your deliverables. Below is a list
of items that should be included in your first deliverable.
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>
Due Date</H3>
January 21 1999, Thursday, in class
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>
Objectives</H3>
The purpose of this document is to convince your customer (and since you
are at school, your instructor) that you have a good understanding of what
the project is all about and that your team is qualified to do this project.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H3>
Understanding</H3>
One of your major tasks for the current period of time is developing an
understanding of the various technologies and tasks concerned with your
project. This includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing
your task as well as the technologies that you will be extending, enhancing,
or changing.

<P>In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained understanding
by writing an introduction to your project that highlights its various
important aspects. You should also include a description of activities
done in support of developing understanding - like interviews with the
customer, for example. (One of the best ways, of course, to gain an understanding
of a piece of software is to interview the original developer.)
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>
Technical Marketing Sheet</H3>
Include a one or two page technical marketing sheet (a bit more technical
than a "sales brochure") suitable for describing your product to a technically
literate outside audience. This document should be successful in reflecting
that you really understand what problem is being solved and can articulate
how your product will add value.
<BR>
<HR>

Project Plan</H3>
Use the outline below in presenting your project plan.
