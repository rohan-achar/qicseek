<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style" SIZE=6><B>Ninth (and last!) Homework</B></FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Get your work checked and signed off by a classmate, then show it to your TA in lab by Monday, March 12.   This
assignment is short; use the remaining time to complete the lab assignment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(a) </B></FONT>Suppose you have an electronic cookbook that contains a list of
recipes defined as follows:</P>
<pre><code>     Recipe = namedtuple('Recipe', 'title ingredients steps')</code></pre>
The title is a string, ingredients is a list of strings, and steps is
a list of strings.  For example:
<pre><code>     r = Recipe('Thai Iced Coffee', ['coffee', 'sugar', 'condensed milk', 'ice'],
                ['brew coffee', 'mix with sugar and condensed-milk',
                 'pour coffee mixture over ice'])</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>(a.1)</strong>
Define the function <code>is_ingredient_in_recipe</code>
as described below.
<pre><code>def is_ingredient_in_recipe(r: Recipe, ing: str) -> bool:
   """ Return true if the string occurs in the recipe's ingredients list """</code></pre>
</p>
<p><strong>(a.2)</strong>
  Define the function <code>are_all_steps_short</code>
  as described below.
<pre><code>def are_all_steps_short(r: Recipe, limit: int) -> bool:
   """ Return true if every step in the recipe is no longer than the limit """</code>
</pre>
<p>Try to do this using list comprehensions or map/filter/reduce (and
  remember that reduce has to be imported from the
  <code>functools</code> library). [Hint:  First, try defining <code>count_words</code> and
<code>is_step_short</code>, each of which can be done in one line.]</p>
<!-- -->
<p><strong>(a.3)</strong>
Define the function <code>is_recipe_simple</code>
as described below.
<pre><code>def is_recipe_simple(r: Recipe) -> bool:
   """ Return true if recipe has 10 or fewer steps and each step is
       no longer than 6 words. """</code></pre></p>
<!-- -->
<p><strong>(a.4)</strong>
The first word of each step is a verb (e.g., bake, mix, grill); we can
call that the technique involved in that step. Define the function
<code>does_recipe_use_technique</code> as described below.
<pre><code>def does_recipe_use_technique(r: Recipe, technique: str) -> bool:
   """ Return true if at least one step has the specified technique """</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a.5)</strong>
  Now, suppose you want to select recipes that will help you practice a
  particular technique. Define the function
  <code>simple_practice_recipes</code> as described below, using
  previously defined functions where appropriate.  Try to use list
  comprehensions and/or map/filter/reduce.
<pre><code>def simple_practice_recipes(rList: 'list of Recipe', technique: str) -> 'list of Recipe':
   """ Return a list of the recipes from the input that are simple
       and that use the specified technique"""</code></pre>
</p>
<p><strong>(a.6)</strong>
  Most of you probably recognize this problem from a quiz last quarter.
  Now that you've had some experience in two programming languages,
  what do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of programming
  in each?  (You don't have to write anything formal for this; just
  spend a little time reflecting on the issues.)
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(b)</B> Be able to give answers to questions
  like these about the theme park simulator.  Feel free to talk with your classmates about them, but realize
  that the point isn&#39;t to <I>have</I> the answer but to know <I>how to
    get</I> the answer, especially if similar questions should show up on exams.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">The function <code>parseAttractionFile</code> reads attractions into a dictionary, then converts the dictionary into a list and passes the list to the AmusementPark. What data structure does the AmusementPark useto store the attractions, and why?</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">The function <code>parseCustomerFile</code> reads customers into a dictionary (why?), then converts the dictionary values into a list and passes it to the AmusementParkSimulation. What data structure(s) does the AmusementParkSimulation use to store the customers, and why? What other data structures is a customer part of during a day in the park? <!-- ***** APS stores customers in Priority queue with arrival time as its priority, to start with (or more literally, as a sorted list). Overall, customers are stored in an unordered list as customers in the park, and they go into and out of queues for rides (inqueued into ride lines, dequeued into ride cars where they're stored as a list, dequeued back into the park's list of customers). Outside of the park's list of customers, it's references that get stored into the rides.--></FONT><BR><BR>
