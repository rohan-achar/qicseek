<p>The Technology Garden is a community maintained garden located in an office that is equipped with sensors and linked to ubiquitous displays mounted throughout the workplace.</p>
<p>The Technology Garden supports dialog and thinking about how humans and plants relate to each other. By involving our institution in the care and observation of a community garden located in an office, we will also explore what role institutions may play in supporting sustainable activities and thinking. We wish to facilitate new forms of awareness and interaction among humans and nature through and with technology. Our goal is not only to bring nature into a working space, but also to establish new forms of understanding of nature/organic planting, of what it means to take care of a plant and how that can be explored in a collaborative manner. We will explore how to transform a working environment into a hybrid living space that values not only group collaboration and efficient technology, but also provides an enjoyable place that invites relaxation and promotes health.</p>
<p>Goals
    * Encourage interaction between humans and nature.
    * Promote awareness of the interaction of natural and social processes.
    * Explore how technology can encourage relationship building through common activities.
    * Encourage dialog on sustainability and sustainable practices.
    * Provide a place with a purpose to meet and relax for both visitors and residents.
    * Create a form of sociality that extends beyond the immediate space of an office or a hallway through visualizations that support garden awareness.
