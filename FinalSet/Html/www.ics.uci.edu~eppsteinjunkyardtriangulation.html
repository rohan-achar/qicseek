Triangles and Simplices
</H2>
These pointers discuss triangles and their higher-dimensional generalizations
(<I>simplices</I>).
I am particularly interested in <I>triangulation</I>
by which I mean partitioning regions into triangles,
tetrahedra, or higher dimensional simplices, for various applications
including finite element mesh generation and surface interpolation.
(The other meaning of triangulation involves
determining locations and distances from certain measurements.)
For more material on the first type of triangulation,
see the <A HREF="/~eppstein/gina/meshgen.html">mesh generation section</A>
of <A HREF="/~eppstein/geom.html">Geometry in Action</A>
or the list of my own
<A HREF="/~eppstein/pubs/geom-tri.html">triangulation papers</A>.

and 2nd Ajima-Malfatti points</a>. How to pack three circles in a
triangle so they each touch the other two and two triangle sides. This
problem has a curious history, described in Wells' <i>Penguin Dictionary
of Curious and Interesting Geometry</i>: Malfatti's original (1803)
question was to carve three columns out of a prism-shaped block of
marble with as little wasted stone as possible, but it wasn't until 1967
that it was shown that these three mutually tangent circles are never
the right answer.

<LI><A HREF="http://mathforum.org/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/largest.equil.tri.html">Equilateral
triangles</A>.  Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a
square torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles
in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; <A HREF="tripack.html">my answer</A>
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, <A HREF="tripack.ps">shown below</A>.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see F&aacute;ry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

<P>Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.

This is clearly
polynomial time: the decision problem can be solved by finding
the intersection of O(n<sup>2</sup>) shapes, each the union of two disks, so doing this
naively and applying parametric search gives O(n<sup>4</sup> polylog),
but it might be interesting to push the time bound further.
