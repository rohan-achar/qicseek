Modular Decomposition<br>
<a href="/~lueker/">George Lueker</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

A <i>module</i> of a graph is a subset M of vertices such that any
vertex outside of M is either connected to all of M or none of M.
Repeatedly finding and contracting nontrivial modules produces a
<i>modular decomposition</i> of the graph, which can be arranged to
form a tree in which each node has a graph with vertices
corresponding to its children, and the graph at each node is either
complete, degenerate (without edges), or <i>prime</i> (without
nontrivial modules). The original graph can then be obtained by
expanding the tree bottom-up, blowing up the vertices at each node
into graphs coming from the corresponding subtrees. 

<p>Motivated by a recent paper [R. M. McConnel and J. P. Spinrad,
"Linear time modular decomposition and efficient transitive
orientation of comparibility graphs", 5th SODA (1994) 536-545],
George discussed applications of modular decomposition to maximum
weight independent sets, transitive orientation, and cograph
recognition, and described a method for constructing large prime
graphs.</p>
