<H2>7. Conclusions</H2>
In conclusion, Chimera makes a variety of contributions to software engineering environments and to hypertext technology, including the simultaneous satisfaction of the requirements described in the introduction.  The essence of the contributions are key concepts and separations of concerns, provision of an effective set of server capabilities, and the demonstrated ability to simultaneously satisfy a wide variety of objectives in a single system.<p>

The concepts and separations include view-specific anchors and separating object and anchor persistency from link persistency. Viewers define anchors and a hypertext server has responsibility for management of the links.  Allowing viewers to define anchors permits a variety of types of anchors to be defined, and they may be implemented in non-invasive ways.  Neither the database(s) of objects nor the user interface are part of Chimera or its concepts.  The concepts are defined in a media-independent manner and such that scalability is supported.<p>

The Chimera server interface supports multiple, concurrent clients written in multiple programming languages and demonstrates that commercial "black-box" tools can be integrated (provided they support minimal interprocess communication).<p>

We have built a prototype system, Chimera, to validate both the concepts and architecture. In addition, we believe our approach has value outside of the SDE domain and can aid such tasks as ethnographic studies and the building of digital libraries.<p>

Some open, and potentially troublesome, issues with this approach exist. Since viewers define anchors, and viewers may be heterogeneous, a lack of consistent user interface to the hypertext is more likely to occur than not. More troublesome from the SDE point of view, however, is the observation that the relations indicated by the hypertext links are in addition to whatever relations are maintained by the environment's object managers. This may yield a number of problems, including maintaining consistency in the face of change to the object stores. On the other hand it does not seem realistic to assume the existence of a single object manager which is responsible for maintaining all relations in an environment, whether they originate from quick, dynamic, and user-discretionary hypertext link creation, or careful specification and design of a complex project's master database of strongly-typed artifacts. The broad research issue, in a heterogeneous world, is determining how to maintain consistency between various relation/link managers. For a near-term partial solution, one approach we intend to pursue is the automatic creation (and maintenance) of hyperlinks from object manager relations; in such a case hypertext style navigation of an OM store would be enabled. It seems much more problematic to attempt to go the other direction, however (from hyperlinks to OM relations), because of the limitations of current OM systems. Additional key research activities include determining appropriate mechanisms for supporting access controls (so, e.g., a project's on-line personnel records are not accessible by those unauthorized), versioning, and support for collaborative hyperweb creation.
