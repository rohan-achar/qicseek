Combinatorial Pair Testing: Distinguishing Workers from Slackers
</h1>
<h2>
Michael Goodrich
</h2>

<p>

We formalize a problem we call
combinatorial pair testing (CPT), which has applications
to the identification of uncooperative or unproductive participants
in pair programming, massively distributed computing,
and crowdsourcing environments.
We give efficient adaptive and nonadaptive CPT algorithms and we show
that our methods use an optimal number of testing rounds to within
constant factors.
We also provide an empirical evaluation of some of our methods.

This is joint work with David Eppstein and Dan Hirschberg, to appear
at WADS 2013.
