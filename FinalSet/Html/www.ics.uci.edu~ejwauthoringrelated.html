<P>This page contains links to related work on remote collaborative
authoring and versioning. The WWW4 Authoring Tools Breakout
Session directly led to the formation of the WebDAV Working Group,
and hence is interesting from a historical perspective. Note that the
protocol specifications listed here are not being actively worked on.</P>

Authoring Tools Breakout Session</A> at

WWW4</A><BR>
<BR>
Discussion on how to achieve interoperability among distributed web
content authoring tools was the focus of this breakout session
following the "development tools" session on developers day at WWW4.
This session identified a list of issues which affect the interoperability
of distributed editing tools, including access control, getting raw
HTML before server processing, authentication, versioning (the
lost update problem), document DTD labeling, BROWSE and MKDIR
methods, editing of variants, and others.
