<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Abstract</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Traditionally, a large introductory course meant
a lecture hall with a single lecturer talking and students taking notes--but
no longer. Today a wide variety of techniques, not only in the classroom
but in labs and faculty offices and cyberspace, can make a large introductory
course an extremely effective educational experience. We explore these practices,
with pointers for further information, as a guide for instructors or departments
faced with the large-course model of instruction.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>THE CHALLENGES OF LARGE CLASSES</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Introductory computer science courses present
their own unique challenges. The range of student backgrounds may be very
wide in a single course, from complete novices to students with many years
of self-taught experience. The specification of programming assignments,
like the specification of any software, is notoriously difficult. Assignments,
particularly those involving production of software, are voluminous and
require painstaking evaluation. The time demands on students are greater
than in non-laboratory courses, and they increase further as more open-ended
projects are assigned.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Couple this with an enrollment of 100 students
or more (in some institutions, enrollments of 500 are not unheard of), and
the challenges multiply.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>We will characterize these issues below, and go
on to consider practices and strategies that may help resolve these difficulties
and occasionally even turn them to advantage.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Increased Size, Increased Workload</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Outside of the classroom itself, the work of grading
and individual assistance increases at least linearly with enrollment. Also,
if the students in a course are distributed normally, the distance between
the strongest and the weakest will probably be much greater than in a small
class, which means that the students at either end of the scale are likely
to require even more extra attention.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Even the effort of preparing materials, assignments,
and exams is greater in a large course, with more concentrated advance preparation.
Examination questions that can be graded rapidly (of which multiple-choice
questions are an extreme example) typically require more preparation time
than open-ended questions, but as enrollments increase, the value of that
tradeoff changes. Likewise, extra time spent perfecting the specifications
of lab assignments becomes essential with higher enrollments, since fielding
individual questions to clarify ambiguities or errors from, say, 20% of
the students becomes unmanageable as the class size increases. This added
preparation time is a significant extra burden in teaching large courses.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Student Anonymity</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>In large classes, individual students can remain
largely anonymous. This can result in inattention--think of students in
the back of the room reading the newspaper or, more currently, playing solitaire
on their laptop computers. Inattention can produce apathy and disconnectedness--
when the teacher takes an active personal interest in a student&#39;s progress,
the student works harder and learns better, but personal contact is limited
in a large class. The ultimate result may be attrition--when students are
not engaged and their performance suffers, they find it easy simply to slip
away.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Distributing the Work Yields Inconsistency</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Distributed processing addresses many of these
problems, as we divide students into smaller discussion and lab sections
and apportion their work to assistants for grading. But this leads to yet
another problem: inconsistency in what the students learn and in the grades
they receive.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>TECHNIQUES AND STRATEGIES</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Below we catalog many of the strategies successful
instructors have used for resolving these issues.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Course Organization</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>As mentioned above, the classic organizational
approach to accommodating the increased workload in a large course is to
create discussion and/or lab sections, which might range in size from 5
to 30 students. Later we describe strategies for dealing with the potential
for inconsistency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>One alternative organization is self-paced courses
(as at the University of California, Berkeley</FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_79">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>),
in which students learn independently, on their own schedule, making an
appointment with a grader as they complete each assignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Another approach is to eliminate the large lecture
entirely, conducting each section independently. CMU follows this approach,
in which the only unifying element is a common examination at the end of
the term. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_78">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_76">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_73">Endnotes</A></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Many institutions offer a variety of introductory
courses, some more gentle and some more accelerated than the mainstream
course. To eliminate some attrition, students might be permitted to transfer
from one course to another more flexibly--perhaps at a later point in the
term--than is the norm.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Even in a single course, some variation in assignments
can accommodate a wider range of students. Contests or extra credit can
give the strongest students an opportunity to shine. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_72">Endnotes</A></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>In the Classroom</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>A variety of active learning techniques can keep
students engaged with the material in class. At intervals during the lecture,
the instructor can ask the students to spend a few minutes working out a
problem, either individually or in small groups. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_71">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_70">Endnotes</A></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Passing out overhead transparencies and pens allows
some students to share their work, providing valuable discussion material
for the whole class.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>With the greater availability of in-class computers
and projection equipment, real-time demonstrations become more feasible.
While an entire class period in a darkened room may tax any student&#39;s
ability to stay awake, judicious use of these techniques can be highly effective
at maintaining interest. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_69">Endnotes</A></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>As size increases, the number of students who
must unavoidably miss class increases as well. Audio- or videotaping lectures
and making the tapes available for later review provides students an easy
way to catch up, and one more complete and effective than just relying on
a classmate&#39;s notes. In general, fostering a sense of community in the
course helps keep students engaged. Eric Roberts points out that the energy
and momentum of a large class may provide an advantage over small classes.
</FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_68">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>
Community can be fostered by running jokes, by class parties, by a course
web page or on-line discussion group.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Out of the Classroom</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Student alienation decreases when the instructor
is accessible outside of class. The solitary lecturer appears distant and
unapproachable; having frequent office hours and repeatedly soliciting attendance
helps break the barrier down. At UC Irvine, the campus subsidizes a &quot;take-a-
professor-to-lunch&quot; program in which a group of five students may invite
a professor to lunch in any campus food facility; each student receives
a one-dollar discount and the faculty member gets a free lunch, above and
beyond the opportunity for interaction on a human scale.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Learning students&#39; names is another tried-and-true
technique. Learning over 100 names may not be feasible for every instructor,
but these techniques make it possible to learn a significant proportion:
Require each student to provide a snapshot (with the name on the back) and
review them like flash cards, or have every student give his or her name
before asking in-class questions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Electronic mail (sent privately and individually
to the instructor or assistants) and on-line bulletin boards or news groups
(with postings accessible to the entire class) can be channels for class
announcements, questions, and discussion, greatly enhancing availability
and creating community.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>One flexible approach to managing the volume of
messages is to have a course mailing address that goes to the entire teaching
staff. Then, whoever reads the mail first can reply to it, with a copy back
to the list so that the others will know a response has been sent. This
provides rapid turnaround for the students, distributes the correspondence
workload, and gives the instructor a real-time picture of how the course
is going. Any messages of general interest to the class can be posted or
forwarded to the group as a whole (perhaps with identifying information
removed).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Web-based software </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_67">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>
can maintain archives of official announcements and can, by coordination
with the registrar, maintain electronic class mailing lists that reflect
up-to-date enrollments. Of course the Web and other technologies can help
with a variety of course-management tasks. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_66">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_65">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_64">Endnotes</A></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Assignments and Grading</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Even when courses are divided into sections, often
the students take a common exam. To preserve consistency across sections
when grading the exam, it is best for a single individual to grade every
student&#39;s response to a given question. Where the enrollment is too
large to permit this, great care must be taken to design formal rubrics
or grading standards and to ensure adherence to it by cross-checking graded
problems periodically during the process. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_63">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>
 This is time well spent, because students do compare their results and
will focus laser-like on any perceived inconsistency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Programming assignments are no exception to the
general difficulty of specifying software requirements. Questions about
an assignment&#39;s requirements always arise, and teaching staff may quite
reasonably give contradictory answers. Expecting to eliminate all ambiguity,
at least in larger, design-oriented assignments, is unrealistic.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>One approach to this issue is to let each section
leader make these small decisions for his or her section, assign grades
accordingly, and perhaps recognize the lack of comparability among sections
when assigning final grades, as described below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>A second approach is to identify for each assignment
a single person with decision-making authority, typically one of the section
leaders. Other section leaders will defer all substantive questions to this
authority, who will issue consistent answers and clarifications (electronic
mail or bulletin boards help immensely here). This authority can also take
the lead in grading that assignment consistently with his or her pronouncements,
by preparing the scoring standards if not by doing all the grading. Of course
this decision-making position could rotate among the teaching staff from
one assignment to the next.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>When setting grades, the conventional approach
is to grade the entire class on one scale (be it curved or fixed). In a
typical course, lab assignments might count for 40% of the course grade
and exams might count 60%. The exams might well be graded comparably across
sections, as described above. The assignments, however, would more typically
be graded by a different person for each section. Those scores might also
be comparable across sections, perhaps by following the practices described
above, but often they are not. How, then, can we assign course grades consistently?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>One approach to smoothing out these inconsistencies
is to normalize the scores across sections, raising the scores for sections
that appear to have harsher grading. However, this approach presumes that
the populations of each section are comparable, which is probably not realistic.
Another approach is simply to recognize the lack of comparability, treating
each section as an independently graded course which happens to have 60%
of its grading in common with the other sections. To follow this approach,
the instructor must explain to students from the outset that grades are
not comparable across sections because each grader grades differently; the
instructor must also meet with each section leader to set the grades, perhaps
using the common 60% from the exam scores to constrain the variation among
sections.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Staff Management</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>A major part of the workload in teaching large
courses is managing the teaching staff--teaching assistants, section leaders,
lab assistants, tutors, graders, and so on. Recruiting graduate students
as teaching assistants is harder in computer science than in many disciplines,
because computer science students have opportunities for research assistantships
or outside employment that are often not available to students in other
areas. One often-overlooked source of teaching staff is advanced undergraduate
students; with appropriate selection and training, they can be extremely
effective section leaders, tutors, and graders. Moreover, often they are
paid at a lower rate than graduate students, providing more staffing for
the same price. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_62">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_61">Endnotes</A></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Some people may be born with teaching talent,
but every section leader should be exposed to departmental policies and
the issues surrounding teaching undergraduates in the university (including
respect for diverse backgrounds); nor should their first experience speaking
before a group or grading students&#39; work be in the section they lead.
Prospective or first-time section leaders should have some kind of training
as described in </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_60">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Above and beyond training, the teaching staff
of a large course should meet periodically to compare notes, coordinate
policies, discuss current difficulties, and exchange experiences. Staff
meetings are an important way for the instructor to get feedback about the
progress of the course from the people on the front lines. In-person meetings
work better than electronic mail exchanges alone, because they provide a
specific time to focus on the course.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>In the Lab</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Having lab partners, group work, and peer testing
of students&#39; programs can all diminish feelings of alienation, as can
face-to-face grading.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Electronic submission of programs and automated
testing of correctness can not only make the grading workload more manageable,
but also provide a more thorough assessment than traditional grading and
free the grader&#39;s time to consider issues such as design, style, interface,
and documentation, which are not amenable to automated assessment. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_59">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_58">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_57">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_56">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_55">Endnotes</A><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_54">Endnotes</A></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Viewing the Future</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>With the advent of the World-Wide Web and an increased
focus on distance education, one might expect introductory courses to be
larger still in the future. Yet such classes, typically asynchronous as
well as geographically distributed, would have less cohesion and sense of
community than a traditional course. The information bandwidth for electronically
mediated courses--even with live, real-time video--is still much narrower
than for in-person contact. &quot;The next best thing to being there&quot;
is indeed second-best; educators estimate that an instructor&#39;s words
account for less than half the information conveyed in a classroom. Even
in a large lecture hall, the fine points of an instructor&#39;s intonation,
gestures, and body language, as well as the reactions and rustling of the
audience, add information to the presentation that electronic means typically
don&#39;t capture. While technology can improve large courses in many ways,
in-person instruction is unlikely to disappear, certainly not without a
significant diminution of pedagogical effectiveness.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>We have described a wide range of ways to enhance
the quality of large introductory courses. We also note that many departments
with large introductory enrollments take a broader approach to this issue
by recruiting and retaining permanent faculty as introductory education
specialists. </FONT><A HREF="large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_53">Endnotes</A></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Conventional wisdom holds that small classes are
better, but even if we accept that, we cannot simply wish our large enrollments
away. The quality of large introductory courses can be excellent with adequate
resources and informed, thoughtful management.</FONT></P>
