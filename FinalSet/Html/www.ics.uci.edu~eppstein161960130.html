<h1>Deterministic selection</h1>

Last time we saw quick select, a very practical randomized linear
expected time algorithm for selection and median finding. In
practice, this is all you need to use. But for theoretical
purposes, it's unsatisfying to have only a randomized algorithm,
and in some rare circumstances it may more important to be
predictable than to be fast. So can we get a linear worst case time
algorithm? We'll describe a solution invented by five people: <a
href="people.html#blum">Blum</a>, <a href="people.html#floyd">
Floyd</a>, <a href="people.html#pratt">Pratt</a>, <a href= 
"people.html#rivest">Rivest</a>, and <a href="people.html#tarjan">
Tarjan</a>. 

<p>Recall that quickselect chooses a random "pivot" x, partitions
the list into elements less than and greater than x, and calls
itself recursively in one of the two sublists. The even quicker
selection method I outlined does something similar, but chooses the
pivot in a complicated way, by calling itself recursively in a
random sample of the input. Our deterministic algorithm will use
the same idea of choosing x by performing a recursive call.</p>

<p>If we could do so quickly, one good choice would simply be to
let x be the median of the values. Then each recursive call would
only be on a subset of half the values. But of course if we knew
how to find the median, we'd be done, so finding the median is too
good to hope for. Instead let's just try to get something close to
the median (say within n/4 positions of it). Then each recursive
call would be on a larger fraction of the input (3n/4) but this
still might be good enough.</p>

<h2>Median of medians</h2>

How can we get something close to the median, reasonably quickly?
Just like the "quicker selection", Instead of finding the median of
the whole set, find a median of a sample. How do we choose the
sample? Medians again! 

<p>Median-of-medians algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>Line up elements in groups of five (this number 5 is not
important, it could be e.g. 7 without changing the algorithm much).
Call each group S[i], with i ranging from 1 to n/5.</li>

<li>Find the median of each group. (Call this x[i]). This takes 6
comparisons per group, so 6n/5 total (it is linear time because we
are taking medians of very small subsets).</li>

<li>Find the median of the x[i], using a recursive call to the
algorithm. If we write a recurrence in which T(n) is the time to
run the algorithm on a list of n items, this step takes time
T(n/5). Let M be this median of medians.</li>

<li>Use M to partition the input and call the algorithm recursively
on one of the partitions, just like in quickselect.</li>
</ul>

Can we say anything about how many items are included in this last
recursive call? It's easier to talk about this in terms of the
elements thrown away (not included in the call). 

<blockquote>We always throw away either L3 (the values greater than
M) or L1 (the values less than M). Suppose we throw away L3. 

<p>Among the n/5 values x[i], n/10 are larger than M (since M was
defined to be the median of these values).</p>

<p>For each i such that x[i] is larger than M, two other values in
S[i] are also larger than x[i] (since x[i] is the median of
S[i]).</p>

<p>So L3 has at least 3 elements in each of at least n/10 groups
S[i], for a total of at least 3n/10 elements. By a symmetric
argument, L1 has at least 3n/10 elements.</p>

<p>Therefore the final recursive call is on a list of at most 7n/10
elements and takes time at most T(7n/10).</p>
</blockquote>

This algorithm has the property we want, that each recursive call
only involves a constant fraction of the input. 

<h2>Deterministic selection algorithm</h2>

Before we analyze our algorithm, let's write it out more carefully
in pseudocode. Also, instead of using a special algorithm to find
the median in each subset S[i], let's just call the method
recursively again. To prevent infinite recursion, we have to stop
when L is so small that there aren't enough x[i] values to find
medians of. 

<pre>
    select(L,k)
    {
    if (L has 10 or fewer elements)
    {
        sort L
        return the element in the kth position
    }

    partition L into subsets S[i] of five elements each
        (there will be n/5 subsets total).

    for (i = 1 to n/5) do
        x[i] = select(S[i],3)

    M = select({x[i]}, n/10)

    partition L into L1&lt;M, L2=M, L3&gt;M
    if (k &lt;= length(L1))
        return select(L1,k)
    else if (k &gt; length(L1)+length(L2))
        return select(L3,k-length(L1)-length(L2))
    else return M
    }
</pre>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

The pseudo-code above gives us a number of comparisons that can be
found by solving the recurrence 

<pre>
    T(n) &lt;= 12n/5 + T(n/5) + T(7n/10)
</pre>

The 12n/5 term comes from two places: we can sort each of the sets
S[i] with seven comparisons (homework 2.31), so the step in which
we compute the x[i] values takes 7n/5 comparisons total. And then
the step in which we partition L takes n-1 more comparisons. The
other two terms come from the two recursive calls, in which we find
M and then the overall return value. As we discussed earlier, the
second recursive call is on a list of at most 7n/10 elements hence
its T(7n/10) bound. 

<p>Actually with some more care we can do a little better: we don't
really need to sort the sets S[i], just find their medians, which
only requires 6n/5 comparisons. The resulting information, together
with the computation of M, should already be enough to eliminate
3n/10 elements from L. So we could get a recurrence with 6n/5 in
place of the 12n/5 above, and save a factor of two in the total
comparisons. But since this result is mainly of theoretical
interest, I've left it in the simpler and easier to understand form
above.</p>

<p>This recurrence looks like one coming from a divide and conquer
algorithm, but one which splits the problem unequal parts. But in
this case the important fact is that the parts add up to less than
the whole, when this happens it doesn't matter as much how equal or
unequal they are.</p>

<p>There are two ways to analyze a problem like this. The first is
the method I showed for quickselect, in which we try to form an
inductive proof that something is O(n) by assuming it's cn for some
specific c, expanding the right side of the recurrence, and working
through the math to determine what c should be. In our case we
have</p>

<pre>
    T(n) &lt;= 12n/5 + T(n/5) + T(7n/10)

     = 12n/5 + cn/5 + 7cn/10

     = n (12/5 + 9c/10)
</pre>

If this is to be at most cn, so that the induction proof goes
through, we need it to be true that 

<pre>
    n (12/5 + 9c/10) &lt;= cn

    12/5 + 9c/10 &lt;= c

    12/5 &lt;= c/10

    c &lt;= 24
</pre>

Which tells us that we can prove by induction that T(n) &lt;= 24n
(or any larger constant times n). We also need to deal with the
base case but that is easy. 

<p>The second method to analyze a recurrence like this one is to
draw a tree showing the sizes of the problems in each recursive
call, and analyze the total size of problems on each level of the
tree. The total number of comparisons can then be found by
multiplying this total subproblem size by the 12/5 factor of
comparisons per element in each call. The tree starts with a root
problem of size n, and then each node has two subproblems, one of
size 1/5 its parent, and the other of size 7/10 its parent.</p>

<pre>
          n
        /   \
       n/5        7n/10
      /   \       /   \
    n/25 7n/50 7n/50 49n/100
    / \   / \   / \   / \
</pre>

Each problem on one level is replaced by two problems on the next
level down, of sizes 1/5 and 7/10 the parent. So the total size on
the next level is 1/5+7/10=9/10 that of the previous level
(sometimes even less when a subproblem reaches a base case and
doesn't make more recursive calls). 

<p>Therefore the total number of comparisons is</p>

<pre>
    12/5 (n + 9n/10 + 81n/100 + ...)

    = 12/5 n (1 + 9/10 + (9/10)^2 + (9/10)^3 + ...)

    = 12/5 n 1/(1-(9/10))

    = 24n
</pre>

<a name="geom">As a general rule, the <i>geometric series</i>
sum(x^i) (for i from 0 to n-1) solves to (1-x^n)/(1-x), and
whenever x is less than 1 the limit of the sum as n goes to
infinity becomes 1/(1-x). The sum above is just a case of this
formula in which x=9/10. The same tree-expansion method then shows
that, more generally, if T(n) &lt;= cn + T(an) + T(bn), where
a+b&lt;1, the total time is c(1/(1-a-b))n.</a> 

<p>So our deterministic selection algorithm uses at most 24n
comparisons and takes O(n) time.</p>

<p>With a lot of work one can reduce the number of comparisons to
2.95n [see <a href="http://www.netlib.org/confdb/soda95/DZ.html">D.
Dor and U. Zwick, "Selecting the Median", 6th SODA, 1995</a>] which
is a little less than twice as much as randomized selection, but
much more complicated and less practical.</p>
