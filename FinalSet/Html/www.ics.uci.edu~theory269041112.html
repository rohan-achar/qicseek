Deterministic Truthful Approximation Mechanisms for Scheduling Related
Machines

From:
Proceedings 21st International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of
Computer Science, 2004.
<P>
The authors consider the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel related
machines owned by selfish agents.  They present a family of algorithms
that yield a (4+e)-approximation that incentivizes each selfish agent to
report the actual speed of his or her machine -- i.e., each agent will
maximize his or her own profit by reporting their actual speed.
