<H1>Simple Sample HTML -- Heading</H1>
<HR>
``HTML'' means ``Hypertext Markup Language.''
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>Item one has an <A NAME="anchor-point"> anchor</A>
<LI>Item two of this Unordered List does not.
</UL>
<HR>
<OL>
<LI>This is the first item of an Ordered List.
<LI>Such lists are numbered.
</OL>
<HR>
<P>Paragraphs are bounded by &lt;P&gt; at the start and (optionally)
&lt;/P&gt; at the end.</P>
<P>Of course, lots of folks just begin paragraphs and don't
worry about ending the previous one.  That's fine.  It works.
Part of why/how it works is that lots of things in effect
end paragraphs.  Things like lists and ``Horizontal Rules.''
Here ``Rule'' just means a straight line as one sees below.
<HR>
<P> The general format of bounding something by &lt;XXX&gt; at the start and
&lt;/XXX&gt; at the end works for setting physical styles of print as well:
<UL>
<LI><B>XXX = B for Bold</B>
<LI><I>XXX = I for Italic</I>
<LI><TT>XXX = TT for fixed width ``TeleTypewriter''</TT>
</UL>
