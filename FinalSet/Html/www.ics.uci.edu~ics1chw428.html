<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</h2></a>
<p>
The <a 
href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Middle_East.GIF">Middle 
East</a> is a region that has, especially in recent years, 
become the focus of the world's attention.  In this assignment, we are 
going to focus on three regions in particular: 
<a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Jordan.GIF">Jordan</a>,<a 
href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Israel.GIF">Israel</a>, and Palestine.  The problem with 
attributing a geographical location to a &quot;Palestinian&quot; state is 
that there is officially not such a state in existence          
(yet). Instead, Palestinians live on a majority of the land in <a 
href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/GazaStrip91.jpg">the Gaza Strip</a> and <a 
href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/WestBank.jpg">the West Bank</a> of the Jordan River.  In 
particular, we will pay special notice to some of the important 
political and economic aspects of each country/region, with a special 
focus on the regions' constitutions, modern historical conflict, 
prospects for peace, and economics.  Although 
religion obviously plays <b>some</b> role in the conflict, we have chosen to 
zero in on the purely political and economic concerns of the region.</p>

<h2><a name="landscapes">The Political Landscapes of Jordan, Israel, and the 
Palestinians</a></h2> <p>
<h4>Jordan and the Constitution</h4>
Jordan, or <a href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/">The Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan</a> (named after the Hashemite ruling family) has a <a 
href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/index.html">Constitution</a> 
which, among other things, serves as the &quot;framework&quot; for the 
state.  In particular, Jordan's constitution contains nine components.  
Like the American constitution, Jordan's constitution contains provisions 
for an <a href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap4.html">executive 
power</a> (which discusses the process by which the monarchy 
proceeds), the <a 
href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap5.html">national assembly</a> 
(comprised of both a senate and chamber of deputies), and the <a 
href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap6.html">judiciary</a> (which, 
interestingly enough, is divided into courts that deal specifically with 
civil, religious, and special matters).  In addition, Jordan's 
constitution provides for certain <a 
href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap2.html">duties and freedoms of 
Jordan's citizens</a>.  Such freedoms include land rights, personal 
freedoms, and labor law.

<h4>Israel's Political Structure</h4>

<a href="gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st2">Israel's 
Political Structure</a> parallels that found in many European countries 
(because it is based on a parliamentary system).  It is comprised of 
three main branches, the <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st5">Israeli Legislature 
(a.k.a., the Knesset)</a>, the <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st6"> Israeli Executive 
Branch</a>, and the <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st7">Israeli 
Judiciary</a>.  Israel does not have an official "constitution" per se, 
but <b>does</b> have a number of <i>Basic Laws</i> adopted by the Knesset 
that seem to serve a similar purpose.  The Basic Laws represent the <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st8">Law of the Land in 
Israel</a>.  In particular, the basic laws have helped <i>establish</i> 
the Knesset, the President, the Government, the State Economy, the Israel 
Defense Forces (a.k.a. &quot;the IDF&quot;), the Judiciary, and the 
office of the State Comptroller.  In addition, the Basic Laws have 
included special measures on state lands, the city of Jerusalem, Human 
Dignity and Liberty, and Freedom of Occupation.

<h4>The Political Structure of the Palestinian People</h4>

As stated earlier on, the Palestinian people are not in possession of an 
official constitution as of yet, mostly because there is no 
&quot;official&quot; Palestinian state.  However, Palestinians have 
considered themselves a distinct people whose homeland was taken 
from them.  As a result, Palestinians <b>have</b> produced numerous 
documents that serve as a means of establishing both a national identity 
and a means of self-governance (even under occupation).  For example, 
the Palestinians have legitimized much of their struggle on <a 
href="gopher://alquds.org/00/newarticles/The%20Palestinian%20Right%20of%20Return">the Palestinian Right of Return</a>.  The Right of Return is based on, in large part, to the document that comes closest to a 
Palestinian constitution--<a href="gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/basic/680717.gui">the Palestinian National Charter</a>.
  The Charter was created between July 1-17, 1968, and
 comprises thirty-three articles.  Each article defined what a 
&quot;Palestinian&quot; was (when the document was first created




), as well as providing the rationale for their claim to the land.  
However, parts of the charter <b>have</b> been altered as a result of the 
1993 peace agreement with Israel--paving the 
way for a future Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.

<h2><a name="overview">An Overview-The History of The Arab-Israeli 
Conflict</a></h2>

<p>After years of war following its
 <a  
href="gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5a">independence</a>,
 Israel has come to partial terms with Jordan and the Palestinians. 
 Before we go into the current peace agreements, however, it's important
 to put the conflict between the three sides into context.</p>
 
<p> Following its inception, Israel was involved in the 
<a href="gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5c">1956
 Sinai War</a>. Israel, in its own view, felt that it was being threatened by
 the nations of <a 
href="ftp://ftp.cs.sunysb.edu/pub/EN/www/home.html">Egypt</a>,
<a href="http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/230.html">Syria</a>, 
and Jordan (all three of which had formed a 
military alliance).   The debate over whether Israel <i>actually</i> was  
threatened has been a matter of debate. Nevertheless, it carried out an 
attack against Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (along with France and Great 
Britain).  After much coaxing from the United States, Israel agreed to 
withdraw its troops and turn over the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>  The second main war 
Israel was involved in is also a point of controversy, depending on which 
side you talk to.  <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5e">Israel's 
View of the 6-Day War</a> is that it was justified in launching an attack 
on Egypt, Syria, and Jordan once again because it felt these countries 
were massing troops for an offensive attack of their own.  The <a 
href="gopher://alquds.org/00/introduction/The%201967%20War">Arab 
View of the 1967 War</a> claims that Israel was the instigator.  Egypt, 
Syria, and Jordan say Israel knew full well that the Arabs had no 
intention of attacking.  Whatever one's view, Israel ended up destroying 
much of the air and land forces of the opposing countries.  As a result 
of the 1967 War, Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from 
Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank of the Jordan 
River from Jordan.  It was after the war that the <a 
href="http://www.adfa.oz.au/CS/flg/col/il-plo.html">Palestine Liberation 
Organization</a> was formed.  In Israel's eyes, the PLO was a terrorist 
group bent on destruction.  However, the PLO (and most of the Arab 
world, for that matter) viewed itself as conducting a legitimate 
struggle to free the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
from Israeli occupation.  </p>

<p>The next conflict between Israel and these 
countries was <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5f">the 
1973 Yom Kippur War</a>.  This conflict began when both Egypt and Syria 
(Jordan was not involved) launched an attack on Israel.  Only with 
military aid from the United States was Israel able to repel the 
attack.  Shortly after, the sides signed an agreement, in which Israel 
withdrew from parts of the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>  The 
last major war Israel was involved in was code-named <a 
href="gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5h">
Operation Peace for Galilee</a>.  This 1982 conflict resulted after 
the PLO was forced to move its headquarters into the south part of <a 
href="http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/138.html">Lebanon</a>.  The PLO 
continuously launched attacks 
into Israel, and Israel responded by attacking back.  However, Israel's 
attack proved to be devastating in loss of life for the PLO, 
Palestinian refugees, Lebanese civilians, and the Israeli military 
itself.  To this day, Israel maintains a "security zone" in the south 
part of Lebanon (which encompasses about ten percent of the country's 
total land area).</p>
<p><a href="#table">Return to Table of Contents</a>
<h2><a name="chance">A Chance for Peace?</h2></a>

<p>Following the <a 
href="http://www2.msstate.edu/~rah2/gulf-war.html">
1991 Persian Gulf War</a>, the United States 
and the former Soviet Union pressured Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the 
Palestinians to the bargaining table to negotiate a final peace 
settlement.  Following the 1992 Israeli elections, a more moderate 
government under Yitzhak Rabin came into power.  In the summer of 1993, 
a major breakthrough occurred.  Israel and the Palestinians agreed, for 
the first time on both sides, to recognize each other. This <a href=
"http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/basic@930909.gui/palestine 
1993">Israel-PLO recognition</a> resulted in a Declaration of Principles 
(which was signed on the White House Lawn).  In addition to the 
recognition, Israel agreed to give Palestinians the power of self-rule in 
Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho (with Israeli troop removal from 
these 
immediate areas and the remainder of the West Bank in the future).</p>
  
<p>Following this treaty, Jordan and Israel experienced a breakthrough in 
<i>their</i> negotiations.  They ended up signing a treaty of their own.  
<a href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty-index.html">The 1994 
Jordan-Israel Peace Treaty</a> contains thirty articles, with  provisions 
on (among other things)<a 
href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty.html#article6">water</a>, <a href=
"http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty.html#article7">economic relations</a>, 
and <a 
href="http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty1.html#article19">energy</a>.  
This treaty was also signed at the White House, and officially ended 
forty-six years 
of war between the two sides.</p>
<p><a href="#table">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2><a name="future">The Future of Peace</a></h2>
<p>What the future holds for these three parties is somewhat 
uncertain.  The Israel-Jordan agreement, in our own view, will 
remain in place (<b>as long as</b> both governments remain 
stable).  The Palestinian-Israeli agreement, however, might be 
in jeopardy.  Many (but not most) Jews and Arabs remain against 
the peace process, including the group <a 
href="gopher://alquds.org/11/politics/org/hamas/truth">HAMAS</a>. 
A big sticking point for the next few years is the status of 
Israel's capital of <a 
href="http://www1.huji.ac.il/jeru/prespective.jpg">Jerusalem</a>. Both 
Palestinians and Israelis claim the city as their own.  The fact remains, 
however, that Palestinians live in the East sector of the city, while 
Israelis live in the West sector of the city.  Palestinians want the East 
to become the eventual capital of a Palestinian state, but Israel does 
not want to see the city divided.  To give a background on <b>how</b> 
divided the city has been through the years, you can look at <a 
href="http://www1.huji.ac.il/jeru/timetable.html">the 
history of Jerusalem</a>.  The city began 
between the years 1000 and 961 B.C., when King David reigned.  Since then, 
the city has gone through the conquest of the Persian Empire, the 
Hasmoneans (or the Maccabees), the Romans, the Byzantines, the Muslims, 
the European crusaders, the Mamelukes, the Ottomans, the British, and 
Israel today.  Even in our present time, Jerusalem is considered 
holy to 
three religions (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity).</p>  

<p>  The next main issue that has concerned both sides is the rate of 
Israeli troop withdrawl from the rest of the West Bank.  Palestinians 
want to see a faster troop withdrawl, whereas Israel contends the troops 
will stay until the PLO can stop terrorist attacks.  A related issue is 
the demand that Israel re-instate <a 
href="gopher://alquds.org/00/history/palestine1967/Expulsions%20of%20Palestinians%20from%20West-Bank%20and%20Gaza-Strip">Palestinians expelled from the West Bank and Gaza Strip</a>.</p>

<p>A third sticking point is the question over <a 
href="gopher://alquds.org/00/politics/iwra">water rights</a>.  For 
whatever reason, this issue was not included in the Declaration of 
Principles.  Some, like Dr. Nabil M. El-Khodary believe the 
omission of the water issue was a political move by Israel and was 
therefore intentional.  Again, as with many issues in the Middle 
East, everyone involved has their opinion.  No matter how one 
slices it, though, it <b>will</b> remain contentious until a 
possible settlement.
<p><a href="#table">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2><a name="economy">The 
Economies of Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians</a></h2>

As we have seen, certain parts of the peace treaties 
between Jordan, Israel, and 
the Palestinians are dependent upon healthy economic relations.  In this 
section of the assignment, we'll describe what the economic picture of 
each area looks like--how wealthy (or how poor) the country/area is, 
what each area is dependent upon for economic sustainability, and other 
related statistics.   

<H4>Jordan</H4>
<p> <A
HREF="http://iconnect.com/jordan/cia.html#Economy 
">Jordan's 
economy</A> is very dependent on the economic health of the other 
countries. In particular, Jordan relies on financial support from the 
Gulf States' oil rich monarchies.(lsaid@netcom.com)  The "<A 
HREF="http://iconnect.com/jordan/cia.html#Geography "> 
physical resource bases of Jordan</A> are extremely limited, 
which precludes any substantial development of primary economic activity(even
 if the constraints imposed by the size of their domestic markets 
could be overcome."(lsaid@netcom.com)  We believe that Jordan has relied 
more on its  <A
HREF="http://iconnect.com/jordan/cia.html#People 
">human 
resources</A> (which are plentiful) rather than its physical ones.    
</p>
 <H4>The Palestinians</H4>
<p><A 
HREF="http://http1.brunel.ac.uk:8080/~em93mma/PALESTINE/information.html"> 
Palestine</A> (i.e., the land commonly known as the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip) is primarily used for agricultural purposes. It contains "<A HREF=" 
http://http2.brunel.ac.uk:8080/~em93mma/GIFS2/Cities/">10,162 square 
mile(27,000 square kilometres) of land plus 272 square miles of inland 
water</A>."(Mohammed Abu Sharikh)  According to Mr. Mohammed Abu Sharikh, 
the human resource base of the Palestinian population is estimated to be 
6,409,036.  The Palestinian people are <i>dependent</i> on agriculture.  
Because of the Mediterranean climate, they can grow a wide 
assortment of crops year-round.  These crops are, in turn, sent out to 
Europe and other Gulf countries.</p> 
<H4>Israel</H4> <p> 
</p>Only one economy in the<A 
HREF="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Israel.GIF"> 
Middle East</A> can really be compared to those found in Europe--that of 
 <A HREF="http://www.israel.org/">Israel</A>.  Living 
standards are high, and compare favorably with <A HREF=" 
http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/facts@israel@an2b/economic">European 
levels.</A> "The country boasts a highly diversified <A 
HREF="http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/facts@econ@ec1">economy</A>
It not only produces <A HREF="  
http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/facts@econ@ec7/economic">goods for immediate consumption,</A> but also uses components in local assembly industries and... 
machinery."(Yigal Caspi). The growth of Israel's economy is very high 
compared to other nations in the Middle East.  "Between 1948 and 1958 
high immigration accelerated development in order to 
achieve a reasonable standard of living.  Then from 1960 to 1972 annual 
growth was 9.2%."(Yigal Caspi)  Israel's economy does not depend upon 
agriculture or industry; however, they are shifting to a 
<i>high-tech</i> industrial economy.</p>

<h2><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>So concludes our presentation on the areas of Jordan, Israel, and 
Palestine.  The constitutional/governmental structures of each place have 
especially been points of interest (to us, at least).  In addition, they 
demonstrate 
<i>how</i> these areas govern themselves.  The history of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict has had important effects on the three countries 
covered in this assignment.  After years of war, each side has hammered 
out a peace agreement: hopefully paving the way for a lasting peace.  The 
economic characteristics of Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians are 
important because they may very well play a role in future negotiations 
and peace.  An economic area in particular that has already proven to be 
a point of debate is water resources. This will have to be one of many 
issues negotiated on in the coming years.  In our opinion, peace 
<b>can</b> be achieved--it's just a matter of <b>how</b> it's 
achieved.</p>
