<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Work in pairs; try to work with someone you
haven&#39;t worked with yet this quarter.
<BR>
As you read and comment on each other&#39;s papers, keep in mind the purpose
and audience of the paper (that is, to convince policy makers to support
the author&#39;s point of view and to take some action in furtherance of
that position).
<BR>
On the editor&#39;s written comments, the editor should be sure to write
&quot;Edited by&quot; and his or her name.  Each author must turn in the
editor&#39;s written comments along with the revised version of the paper.
</FONT></P>
<OL TYPE="I">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If the author does not have a short outline,
presenting the argument like a syllogism (i.e., listing each of the supporting
points&mdash;the &quot;premises&quot;&mdash;and then the conclusion), ask him or her
to prepare one.  (This was part of the assignment.)</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Then read the outline&mdash;not the paper (yet)&mdash;and
write the answers to these questions:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>What is the issue?  What is the author&#39;s
position--what does the author want the policy maker to do?  Is the recipient
the right person to take that action?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Do the author&#39;s points actually support
the conclusion?  Are there missing points or hidden assumptions that the
author didn&#39;t list?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Are there flaws in the author&#39;s logic?
 That is, <I>if you accept the premises,</I> does the conclusion follow
logically?  If not, how would you correct the reasoning?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If you disagree with the author&#39;s position,
presumably it&#39;s because you don&#39;t accept his or her premises.  Which
ones don&#39;t you agree with?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If you agree with the author&#39;s position,
which of the premises will the author&#39;s opponents most likely disagree
with? </FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Now read the letter and write answers to these
questions:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>Is the letter in standard business-letter format (without &quot;139W&quot; or a student ID)?</LI>
<BR><LI>Does it address an actual person? Does it address the <em>right</em> person (someone who can take the action the author is advocating)?</LI>
<BR><LI>Does it say what action the author wants the recipient to take, in the very first sentence? [This is almost always the right approach in this kind of letter; there needs to be a good reason to do it differently.]</LI>
<BR><LI>
  <FONT  SIZE=4>Does the organization of the letter match
    the organization of the outline?  Where do they diverge?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the prose in the letter accurately reflect
each point in the outline?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the prose in the letter adequately <I>support</I>
each point in the outline?  How well does the letter explain the basis for
each point?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>How well does it anticipate possible objections?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author engage in emotionalism, name-calling,
or other flaws of argumentation?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it follow the appropriate tone, style,
and form of address for a letter to a policy maker?  Does it read more like
an essay or a research report?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it do the job?  Are you convinced by
the reasoning?  What would make the case stronger?  What needs to be improved
before the author could actually send the letter?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Review your comments with the author (and
vice versa)</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
