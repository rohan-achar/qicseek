<h1>Troubleshooting Java/Eclipse/Python Installation</h1>

This is the first quarter large numbers of students are installing Java,
  Python, and Eclipse.
As I hear about problems and find workarounds, I will add them here, in the
  appropriate sections.
Note that these workarounds are not guaranteed, but they have worked in some
  circumstances.

<h3>Running Eclipse</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Problem</b>: Eclipse cannot locate the JRE.
The following error message will appear when Eclipse starts.
<p>

<p>
<b>Workaround</b>: You need to manually set the <b>PATH</b> system variable
      to include the location of your JRE.
    Normally Eclipse does this automatically.
    Before following the instructions below, find the directory that contains
      <b>Java</b>.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <b>Start</b> button
<li>Click <b>Control Panel</b> entry (on the upper right)
<li>Click the <b>System</b> text/icon (near the end: they are alphabetical)
<li>Click the <b>Advance System Settings</b> shield (upper left)
<li>On the <b>System Properties</b> pop-up window select the <b>Advanced</b> tab
      (it is probably already selected) and click the
      <b>Environmental Variables...</b> button.
<li>In the <b>Environmental Variables</b> pop-up window select <b>PATH</b>
      under <b>Variable</b> in the top pane (it is probably already selected)
      and click the <b>Edit</b> for that pane.
<li>In the <b>Edit User Variable</b> pop-up window, the <b>Variable name:</b>
      text box should show <b>PATH</b> and the <b>Variable value:</b> text
      box should show the current value of <b>PATH</b>, which may be too big
      to fit on the screen.
<li>Put the cursor at the end of the  <b>Variable value:</b> text box and
      type a semicolon and the path to the <b>bin</b> folder in the <b>jre7</b>
      folder in the <b>Java</b> folder you found.
<li>Click the various <b>OK</b> buttons in the 3 pop-up windows.
</ol>
In the picture below, my <b>PATH</b> variables started with
  <b>C:\Program files</b> so I added at the end
  <b>;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin</b> which is where I installed Java.

<p>
Try running Eclipse again and see if you get the same error message; if you do,
   try rebooting and running Eclipse again.
<p>
<li><b>Problem</b>: Eclipse cannot locate tge JNI shared library.
The following error message will appear when Eclipse starts.
<p>
<img src="images/troubleshooting/failedjni.jpg">
<p>
<b>Workaround</b>: I've been told this is often caused by installing
   incompatible version of Java and Eclipse: specifically a 32-bit version
   of one and a 64-bit version of the other.
Go back and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Java and
  Eclispe (heck, do it for Python too), ensuring you are using the 32-bit
  versions of both.
</ol>

2) right click on the eclipse shortcut and selected properties.
   Change target to
   C:\Users\Vicky\Downloads\eclipse\eclipse.exe -vmargs -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
   It sets eclipse to try IP v4 protocol first, if a machine is set to use
   IP v6 as default (the future protocol) there are some applications/protocol
   that cannot us it.
