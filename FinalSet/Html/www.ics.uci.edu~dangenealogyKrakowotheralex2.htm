<H2>KRAKOW BUILDINGS: ALEKSANDROWICZ RESIDENCES, 1802 - 1939</H2>
<H3>by George Alexander</H3>
</center>


In  1802, when Jozef of the family of David, soon to be known as Alexander and later 
Aleksandrowicz, and Dobrysz, daughter of Jakub (Yankel) Gumpel, soon to be known as  
Gumplowicz, were married, the record of their marriage stated that they lived in 
Buildings 203 and 205, respectively, in the Jewish Town in Kazimierz, a part of Krakow.
<P>
According to the census of 1804, quoted by Jan Malecki in the third volume of his and 
Bieniarzowna's monumental opus on Krakow history, the Jewish Town had only 207 
buildings. The entire town of Krakow, including Kazimierz, had 1,772 buildings. Thus, 
the Jewish Ghetto contained 11.7% of the total housing stock. It is of interest that the 
population of Krakow in 1804 was 25,750, of which 4,300 were Jewish. The Jews 
constituted 16.7% of the total population but occupied only 11.7% of the housing. Not 
surprisingly, this indicates that the Jews, hemmed as they were in a Ghetto, were more 
crowded than everybody else. While in Krakow as a whole there were 16.7 people per 
house, in the Jewish section the ratio was 20.8.
<P>
In various records the occupation of Jozef Aleksandrowicz was given as merchant. For 
example, he is listed as such in the detailed listing of the marriage of his daughter Temerl, 
in 1827. The details of that marriage are written in elaborate calligraphy and occupy a full 
page in the bound volume that constitutes the list of all Jewish marriages in Krakow in 
that year. Jozef is listed as having died previously and as having been indeed a merchant. 
However, in the next family document discovered in the Krakow Archives, the 1831 
record of the second marriage of his widowed young (22-year-old) daughter, Rywka, the 
bride's deceased father is said to have been an owner of a building in Kazimierz. In all the 
documents, for sixty or seventy years after 1802 the address of all the Aleksandrowicz 
families is invariably given as building 203. It is logical to assume that this was the 
building that Jozef owned. Not only did he live there from the day he married until his 
death sometimes after 1821 and before 1827, but his widow Dobrysz lived there until her 
death sometimes after 1847 and the families of both their sons, Menashe and Izrael Eliasz 
lived in 1850 and beyond. Only the census of 1881 shows a different address.
<P>
The building Nr. 203 is a large three-story structure. The building is still standing and is 
in good repair and inhabited by many families. I have reasons to believe that its present 
address is Jozefa Street 22. When I visited the building in October 1997 I was told by its 
current inhabitants that it is the oldest standing apartment building in Kazimierz. The 
building is now open on one side, the neighboring structure having been demolished. 
From that open side one can see that each floor has an open wooden outside corridor and 
the building is rather attractive although undoubtedly very old. The size of building 203 
can be seen from its listing in the careful Polish census undertaken in 1790-1792, 
entitled: "Spis ludnosci w Miescie Zydowskim Kazimierzu, przy Krakowie, w 
Woiewodztwie i Powiecie Krakowskim lezacym, przez Rabina Synagogi y Duchownych 
czyniony" (Population census in the Jewish Town Kazimierz  by Krakow, located in the 
District and Province of Krakow, performed by the Rabbi and Clergy of the Synagogue)

Obviously, the listing omits children. It is likely that it also omits some adult inhabitants 
who did not want to be registered, for example, individuals who came from neighboring 
small towns and villages, but did not have the valuable and coveted permit to reside in 
Krakow. Such individuals lived as unregistered boarders, sheltered by registered friends, 
relatives or business associates. From the census, we can infer that in 1790-2 in building 
203 lived at least eight families, a total of 18 adults. Several things can be deduced from 
this list. If Jozef who became Jozef Aleksandrowicz had lived in Building 203 in 1790-2, 
he would not have been listed, because he was only 8 years old at the time of the census. 
However, if, as I assume, his father's name was Herschel and his grandfather David, than 
the family did not live in this building and probably did not own it then. Thus, it appears 
that the family acquired this house after 1792 but before 1802. As can be seen from the 
Tables, nobody in this house had a surname in 1790-1792. Individuals were identified by 
their own profession: such as "seal maker" or "tailor", their father's profession: "son of 
the butcher", their father's name: "Kalman's", "son of Hershel", "son of Isaac", or even 
by relationship to a better known person, such as: "son-in-law of Shmerl". I also found it 
interesting that the 71-year-old tailor had a 30-year-old wife, and that women were listed 
as white-haired. This may sound peculiar, but it is the exact translation of the Polish term 
used in the census.

Jozef Aleksandrowicz had two sons, Menashe and Izrael Eliasz, both of whom married 
and had large families that carried the Aleksandrowicz name. Throughout most of the 
nineteenth century Dobrysz, Jozef's widow, and both sons and their families lived in 
building 203. The first indication that the family moved, perhaps after the death of the 
matriarch Dobrysh, the first record of a different address occurred in the birth certificate 
of Malka Reisel Aleksandrowicz, born on January 23, 1874, daughter of Menashe's son, 
Jozef Aleksandrowicz and his wife Rachel nee Drezner, who in 1874 lived in a desirable 
building, No. 169, on today's Kupa Street, next to the Isaac Synagogue. The census of 
1881, Volume 100-174, of District VIII of Krakow shows that building No. 168 housed 
the Isaac Synagogue (Boznica Izaka) and no inhabitants. The building listed next, No. 
169, on Kupa Street, had only three apartments. In apartment No.1 lived Menashe 
Aleksandrowicz. Menashe was born in 1818, so in 1881 he was 63 years old. According 
to the census, he lived alone, a widower, his wife, Lea nee Katzner, having died earlier. 
In the census, his religion was given as Israelite, his language as German, and his 
profession as a seller of victuals. He was said to be a permanent inhabitant of Krakow, 
i.e. he had the official right to reside in Krakow, and he was able to read and write.
<P>
 On a separate page of the 1881 census, was listed Menashe's son, Jozef, living in 
apartment No. 2. This Jozef, born in 1845, was named after his grandfather, Menashe's 
father. He, too, was described as a permanent resident of Krakow, able to read and write. 
His religion was given as mosaic, but, interestingly, his language was listed as Polish. He 
was said to be engaged in commerce along with his father. With him in apartment No.2 
lived his wife Rachel, daughter of Szaia Jozua Drezner, born in 1847, and his children, 
Jakub, born 6 June 1866, David, born 24 June 1867, Hana, born 1869, Malka, born 1873, 
Szyja (later known as Jozua), born 1877 and Rywka, born 1879. Attached to the page was 
a separate sheet of paper, issued and glued in on May 1, 1881, a birth certificate of 
"Jakub Aleksandrowicz, son of Jozef and Rachel", certifying that he was born in Krakow 
on June 6, 1866. The document was signed by one "Wenner, deputy clerk maintaining 
israelite metrical records in Krakow". This Jakub Aleksandrowicz was a grandson of 
Menashe and eventually became  my grandfather.
<P>
 In apartment No. 3 of building 169 lived the family of Izrael Eliasz Aleksandrowicz, 
brother of Menashe, youngest son of the first Jozef Aleksandrowicz and uncle of the 
second Jozef. Izrael Eliasz was born in 1821. He was listed as a commercial agent. With 
him lived his wife Ester and children Reisel, born 1860, Nachman, born 24 November 
1864 and Elke, born 1867. Attached to this page, on a separate sheet was a document 
issued 30 December 1880, stating that "Aleksandrowicz Nachman, son of Izrael Eliasz 
and Ester", was born in Krakow on November 24, 1864. This document was also signed 
by the deputy clerk Wenner. While I was in Krakow in 1997 I visited the Krakow 
Miodowa Street cemetery and there I saw a new,  post-war, tombstone commemorating 
Nachman Aleksandrowicz.
<P>
Records show that Jakub Aleksandrowicz, grandson of Menashe, gradually moved 
further and further away from the crowded Jewish area in Kazimierz, yet not too far away 
from the bulk of Jewish population. That meant that he was moving to the area of 
Stradom, which straddles between the old Jewish Town in Kazimierz and the city center 
of Krakow (Srodmiescie). Stradom area approaches the royal palace and castle hill of 
Wawel. In 1874 Jakub lived on Dietla Street, a street that was created by filling the bed 
of the old Vistula River, the river that used to separate Krakow from Kazimierz (The 
river bed moved further south and now separates Krakow, including Kazimierz, from the 
district of Podgorze). In 1890 Jakub and family lived on Koletek Street, only one block 
away from the castle hill. Sometimes around 1906 Jakub Aleksandrowicz purchased from 
a family named Metzger two large apartment houses directly opposite the Royal Castle 
on Wawel Hill and overlooking the Vistula River, on Bernardynska Street, corner of 
Smocza Street. This is the premier location in Krakow, it just can not be improved upon. 
Bernardynska Street, the southern access to the castle, is named after the imposing 
Bernardine Cloister located  at its corner with Stradom Street. Smocza Street is named 
after a dragon  (Polish: smok), which, according to legend, lived in a cave under the 
Wawel Hill. After my grandfather Jakub's death in 1935, the two houses, cream-colored 
and with elaborate fronts, many balconies and original stain-glass windows in the 
staircases were inherited by his sons and daughters, i.e. my father and his siblings. Three 
of my uncles died in the Holocaust, one died in Soviet Central Asia, one uncle and my 
father, Maksymilian Aleksandrowicz, known later as Max Alexander, died in New York. 
I consider myself the rightful inheritor of the houses, even though they were taken over 
after the 1939-1945 War by the Polish Communist authorities as "abandoned property" 
and I have not been able to recover them.
<P>
The houses are still in very good repair, the location is absolutely fabulous, as close as 
possible to the Royal Complex, ramparts, Renaissance palace and Baroque cathedral that 
is the See of the Archbishop of Krakow. In the 1930's, Prince Adam Stephan Cardinal 
Sapieha was the archbishop. His successor was Carol Cardinal Woytyla, who eventually 
became Pope John Paul II. The two houses together have 26 apartments. In 1939 I and 
my father, mother and sister lived on the second floor of the corner house, Bernardynska 
11. Our apartment had a balcony facing the Castle and the Vistula River. From my 
bedroom window I could see the round castle keep, the so-called Sandomierska Tower.  
My uncle Jozek and his family lived next to us. On the ground floor lived my aunt Sonka,  
with her husband and son and my grandmother on my mother's side. On top floor, in an 
apartment with a spectacular view of the castle and the Vistula River lived my aunt Lola. 
In the next building, Bernardynska 10, lived my uncle Olek with his family, and my step-
grandmother, Toni. The houses are now fully occupied but I do not know the present 
inhabitants or administrators. Our old apartment is occupied by a real estate company, 
with a big and unsightly advertising sign on the balcony.
<P>
Other branches of the family had comparable histories. Menashe Aleksandrowicz had 
three sons. My father was a grandson of the eldest son, Jozef. The next son, Filip and his 
wife, Dorothea, nee Fraenkel, moved to the area of Podgorze, a part of Krakow lying on 
the other side of  the Vistula. There they became major owners of real estate, including a 
flagship house, still in family hands, the building overlooking the river, at Przy Moscie 1 
(By the Bridge 1). The bridge is gone, a new bridge is located further down the river, but 
the house stands and is in good condition and fully occupied. The widow and children of 
the third son of Menashe Aleksandrowicz, Wolf, moved to the northern part of Krakow. 
Wolf's son, David, lived with his family in an elegant  house that he owned at 4 Biskupia 
Street in the Krowodrza/Kleparz area of Krakow. 
<P>
The listing of houses owned or occupied by my ancestors, the Aleksandrowicz family, 
described above, can serve as  typical for a reasonably well-off Jewish family in Krakow 
over a period starting around 1800.
