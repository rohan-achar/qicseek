<div class=title>Approximation Algorithms for Probabilistic Reasoning:
Sampling and Iterative Inference</div>

<TT>Bozhena Bidyuk</tt>

<div class=abstract>
<b>Abstract</b><BR> The complexity of the exact inference increases exponentially with size and complexity of the network. As a result,
the exact inference methods become impractical for large networks and we seek to approximate the results. A
variety of approximation methods exist. This research focuses on two approximation methods for finding posterior
marginals P(xije) in Bayesian networks: iterative belief updating (defined by Pearl [Pearl 1988]) and sampling.
<br>
The belief updating is an exact inference method for singly-connected networks. It can be applied to loopy networks
to obtain approximate answers. The algorithm is based on message passing: in some order, each node computes and
sends messages to its neighbors incorporating the latest messages it recieved. In a singly-connected network, we can
order nodes so that it will be sufficient for each node to pass one messages in each direction. In a loopy network, the
nodes compute several iterations of messages to achieve convergence (or to demonstrate the lack of convergence).
Thus, belief updating in loopy networks is often referred to as Iterative Belief Propagation or IBP. Although IBP
generally computes only approximate answers, it is known to perform extremely well in several special classes of
networks such as coding networks and noisy-or networks. At the same time, we know that in some instances IBP
does not converge or generates approximate answers far from correct. Currently, we do not have any methodology
that would allow us in general case to predict the convergence of IBP or provide some practical error bounds on
the approximate marginals it computes. In this research work, we examine the influence of the -cutset criteria
on the convergence and quality of approximate marginals computed by IBP. We conjecture the -cutset (defined
as a cycle-cutset with extreme posterior marginals) has effect similar to an observed cycle-cutset which breaks the
loops and leaves the network singly-connected. We prove that the conjecture is true for Bayesian networks without
evidence and show that the error in the approximate marginals computed by IBP converges to 0 as  tends to 0. We
provide empirical support for instances of Bayesian networks with evidence.
<br>
The idea behind the sampling methods for Bayesian networks is to generate a set of samples (where a sample in a
vector space X = fX1; :::;XNg is just an assignment of values to the elements of vector X) and then estimate the
posterior marginals of interest from samples. In general, the quality of the approximate answers depends primarily
on the number of samples generated and the approximate values converge to the exact values as number of samples
increases. However, the sampling variance increases with the size of the sampling space. In this research work, we
focus on the the variance reduction techniques on the example of the Gibbs sampler for Bayesian networks. It is obvious
that we can achieve the reduction in variance by sampling only a subset of variables. However, the implication
is that we have to carry out a lot more analytical computations which may render the whole approach impractical.
We demonstrate that we can reduce sampling space efficiently if we take into consideration the underlying network
structure. The time/space complexity of the exact inference in Bayesian networks is exponential in the induced
width of the graph. In our sampling scheme, called w-cutset sampling, we sample a subset of variables (called a
cutset) that is carefully chosen to reduce the complexity of the graph bounded by the induced width w. We analyze
the problem of finding an optimal w-cutset of a graph (NP-hard in general case) and provide a heuristic algorithm
for finding w-cutset in practice. We show empirically that w-cutset sampling typically finds better approximate
answers than standard Gibbs sampler for a range of w values although its performance eventually deteriorates as w
increases.
