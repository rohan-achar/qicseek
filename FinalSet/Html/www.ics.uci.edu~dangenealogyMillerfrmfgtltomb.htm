<BR>Tombstone of Gittel, wife of <a href="../shabsib.htm#L1.2.2.3">Avrohm Miller</a> and daughter of Moshe Shamshon Scheindlin.<br>
This tombstone stands in Vranov nad Taplou and loosely translates from #90 on Bobby Furst's list:<br>
Here is buried a modest God-fearing woman, her hand and  heart were wide open to the poor;  she suffered hardship at the end of her life, <b>Gittel</b> daughter of R' <b>Moshe Shimshon</b> of blessed memory, wife of the leader R. Avraham Miller of blessed memory, died at a ripe old age on 5 Tishrei 5689 = September 19, 1928

Dear fellow Vranov researchers,


I have sent the translation of the Vranov tombstones for posting on the
H-SIG web site, but it hasn't appeared yet so I have attached an excel
spread sheet with the translations.


Let me know if you want a copy of any of the photos.


I am researching Reiss, Weiss, Roth, Neuman, Heimowitz,  so if you have
any of these names in your tree I would also like to hear from you.

Moishe,

What I have sent to H-SIG for posting is just the translations, not the photos
themselves.  I have attached the photo GIF for #90 to this message and you can
post it to your web site yourself.
