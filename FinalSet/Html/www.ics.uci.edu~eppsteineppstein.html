York area to a Max Eppstein who fled Russia due to Bolshevik
persecution in the 1880's; the two-p spelling may have been acquired by
Max at Ellis Island.  Jerry married Madeline
(n&eacute;e Plumado) in 1928, who was born in Wisconsin in the 1880's and
moved with her family to Placerville, California in the early 1900s. The Plumado
house, where Madeline grew up, is now a historical landmark in
Placerville. Jerry and Madeline had three children: Judy Thornley
(Passed away in 1999),  Michael F., and
Esther McDonald (living in Woodland Hills, California).  A fourth
daughter, Helen Bolton was born to Madeline from a previous marriage.
Michael F. has five sons: Michael Dana, James Charles, Mark William,

family of Mombach, Germany, 1800-1850.</li>

census in Greenville, Bond County, Illinois</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Missouri/Texas/Colorado/Oregon Eppsteins:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Barbara Carpenter is the granddaughter of Carrie Eppstein Livingston.
She writes: "Three Eppstein Brothers, Max, Elias and Leopold emigrated
to the U.S. from Germany in 1854 (approximately). Two sisters, Charlotte
and Rosalie, remained behind. Rosalie married a man named Simon. Their
grandson became the managing director of Rosenthal China. Charlotte
married Heinrich Guttman and had at least one son , Otto. Their son,
Harvey Guttman lives in the U.S.  The brothers settled in Saint Joseph,
Missouri and owned a soap factory. The factory burned down and Leopold
and Elias moved to Texas (perhaps Sherman, Texas). Max (4/1825-4/1903
moved to Denver and he and his wife, Bertha Herzberg (10/1837-2/1912)
had seven children: Seraphene, Julia, Helen, Carrie, Arthur, and twin
girls, Lily and May.  Arthur, the only son married Viola Strauss. They
had two children, Helen and Lily and, thus the Max Eppstein branch name
was lost. ...  I would love to find out about the families of Leopold
and Elias, but have been unsuccessful to date."</li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.portland-insurance.com/agent5.htm">Arthur
Eppstein Insurance Achievement Award</a> was likely named after Arthur
(above), who owned Oregon Automobile and Causality Company in Portland.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/sources/torchbea.htm">Lily
Eppstein Morris</a>, Arthur's daughter, graduated from Barnard in 1929
and endowed the Morris-Eppstein Scholarship Fund there in 1996.</li>

Polish immigrants, originaly called Epztain, but his father was called
Bernhard Epstein (spelling changed to be more German).  During World War
II, Paul lost his Polish citizenship but avoided being deported and
after the war became a Swiss citizen, somehow gaining another P in his
name (perhaps to be more Swiss).  He was well known in Zurich as a
sportsman, friend of many artists and actors, art collecter, and
entertainer.</li>
