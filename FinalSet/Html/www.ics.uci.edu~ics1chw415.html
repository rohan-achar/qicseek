</A>, the Paradise Island</U></H2></B>
<P>Singapore is a very small tropical island occupying only 622.6 square 
kilometers of land.  It is
located at the Southern tip of the Malaysian Peninsula in South-East Asia. 
Due to its strategic

Singapore has benefitted greatly as an <A

<A NAME="vision"><B><U>A Leader in Information Technology</U></B></A></H2> 
<P></B>Today, Singapore has become a 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs/user/kc3r/www/singapore.html">thriving
dynamic center</A> for commerce and industry -- its economy has been ranked
the least risky among Asian countries after Japan.  The Singapore dollar
has been growing strong every year, and its port is still the busiest in
the world.  Singapore has also been placed
among top nations in the world in terms of strategic exploitation of
Information Technology by companies, computer literacy of workers and
telecommunications infrastructure.<br> 
<P>The government's next step is
to make sure it stays competitive in this Information Age.  Therefore, an
efficient, global system of communication and information transfer is
essential for maintaining it's current position as an international
trading center -- businesses will definitely do better if they are linked
to their business partners, other related businesses, the government, and
other relevant information resources.  Advanced information technology
will help them to attain information which would otherwise be unaccessible
or slower to retrieve.</P> 
<P>On August 1991, after conducting a rigorous
study of the major economic sectors of Singapore, and after consulting
with over 200 senior executives from both the public and private 
business sectors, the <A 
HREF="http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/it2k.html"><B>IT2000
Vision</B></A> was formulated.  This vision for 
<A HREF="http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/it2kv.html"><B>"the Next Lap"</B></A>
would bring about an advanced <A
HREF="http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/nii.html"><B>"Nationwide Information
Infrastructure" (NII)</B></A> which will interlink computers in every home,
office, school and factory.   Computers will link Singaporeans to the 
rest of the world, and will therefore 
evolve into an "information appliance" in the same way the telephone and
television did, enabling its users to access electronically stored
information to improve business.  The NII Framework will be built using
the existing network structure, and a 
<A HREF="http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/niitb.html"><B>smaller experimental
infrastructure</B></A> is designed to moderate and control the proceeding
of the construction.</P>
<P>Like the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/nii/NII-Table-of-Contents"><B>U.S. 
NII</B></A>, the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/nii/NII-Benefits-and-Applications"><B>
applications</B></A> of the information infrastructure are believed to be 
able to benefit many.  
<A HREF="http://query1.lycos.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/pursuit?singapore."><B>Both 
plans are similar</B></A> -- the U.S. NII is committed to using 
high-performance computing and high-speed networking to expand and speed up information 
access and needs to be administered through 
<A HREF="#network"><B>multi-agency collaboration.</B></A>  
Singapore's IT2000 Vision similarly focuses on putting a national network 
through bridging, enhancing and expanding its existing 
infrastructure.</P></H3>

<A NAME="education"><B><U>Information Technology in 
Education</U></B></A></H2>
<P><A HREF="http://www.moe.ac.sg/"><B>Singapore's Ministry of 
Education</B></A> aims to nurture talent and develop individual potential 
to the fullest.  It has the important yet difficult task of making sure 
the younger generation do not loose their cultural roots while 
training them to keep up with the latest innovations and technological 
advances.  Today, Singapore has one of the most technologically advanced 
education systems in Asia -- advanced information technology is available 
in many schools.  The
<A HREF="http://nuscc.nus.sg/NUShome.html"><B>National 
University of Singapore</B></A> itself functions as a WWW server in 
Singapore.  WWW sites are found in almost all Singapore 
<A HREF="http://www.moe.ac.sg/schools/welcome.html"><B>Junior 
Colleges</B></A> (equivalent to highschools in the U.S.), and 
<A HREF="http://www.moe.ac.sg/moe/pa/forward.html"><B>technological 
education and training</B></A> is a high priority in the academic 
agenda.</P>
<P>With the recent IT2000 Vision, a national project devoted to education 
in the Information Age is launched.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.iti.gov.sg/innovator/issue15/STW.html"><B>Student's 
and Teacher's Workbench (STW)</B></A> is a joint project between the 
Ministry of Education (MOE) and the 
<A HREF="http://darwin.technet.sg/InfoWEB/economics/industry/ncb.html"><B>National 
Computer Board (NCB)</B></A>, which 
was largely responsible for the initiation of the IT2000 masterplan.  As 
its name suggests, the STW has 2 major components:  The Student's 
Workbench and the Teacher's Workbench.  It provides access to Internet 
and other text, image, audio, and video lesson materials.  Retrieval, 
layout, 
tagging, annotation as well as browsing of media items will also be 
supported.</P>
<P>With the use of Information Technology, students can have access to 
a large variety of learning and educational materials from all over the 
world.  They can also establish world-wide communications with people 
from different countries.  And most importantly, they will learn the key 
to effective utilization of information technology at a very young 
age.  In the long-run, this knowledge will benefit the country's 
growth and prosperity.</P>

<A NAME="network"><B><U>A National Multi-Agency 
Collaboration</U></B></A></H2>
<P>The collaboration between the major WWW servers in Singapore are both 
planned and intended.  They include the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.nus.sg/MEMEX/memex.html"><B>Memex Research PTE 
LTD</B></A>, the
<A HREF="http://darwin.technet.sg:80/technet/"><B>Technet Unit</B></A>, 
the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.nus.sg/"><B>SunSITE Singapre</B></A>, and the 
<A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/aboutst.html"><B>Singapore 
Telecom</B></A>.  The Memex Research takes its name and inspiration from 
Vannevar Bush, a pioneer in computer design.  Bush coined the term 
"Memex" in an article
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/VBush.html.Z"><B><U>As We May 
Think</U></B></A>.  There, the term is defined as "a future device for 
individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library."  
Memex's mission is to deliver enterprise-wide solution for managing 
resources effectively and to prepare for emerging technology.  The 
Technet is a global communication technology with full Internet access.  
It is also the premier organization in Singapore in charge of the 
promotion of the Internet's widespread usage.  The SunSITE Singapore 
operates out of the National University of Singapore's Computer Center.  
It is a SPARCserver 1000 with 4 CPUs and 6GB of disk space.  Finally, the 
Singapore Telecom is licensed by the Telecommunication Authority of 
Singapore to provide telecommunication services.</P>  
<P>Memex, Technet, and SunSITE  work closely together to provide services to 
all public and private sectors of the country.  For example, the Memex 
service is maintained through a collaborative project between the Memex 
Research Pte Ltd and the Technet Unit and is hosted at SunSITE.  The Technet 
Unit is also managed and operated by the Computer Center at the National 
University of Singapore.  Singapore Telecom is somewhat different from 
the other 3 WWW servers because it is not a research or education 
institution.  It's 
original and primary purpose is to provide telephone services to the 
public.  However, as the Internet becomes more and more popular, 
Telecom started a new subsidiary division, the
<A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/info.html"><B>SingNet</B></A>, which is 
a 24-hour service that gives users access to database linked to the 
Internet.  It provides customer and product support to businesses 
over the Internet network and allows home users to e-mail
world-wide.

<A NAME="future"><B><U>The Future of Information Technology in 
Singapore</U></B></A></H2>
Singapore Telecom has been in the forefront of promoting and establishing 
the usage of telecommunications technology through a number of projects.  
On December 27, 1994, it announced it will lower rates for its 
<A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/ilc.html"><B>international 
leased circuits</B></A> by up to 25% starting January 1, 1995. On January 24, the company 
announced its plan to invest US$94 million in an ambitious United Kingdom 
project called 
<A 
HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/inmarsat.html"><B>I-CO</B></A>, 
which will provide a seamless, global mobile service to its customers via a network of 12 satellites, 
providing different telecommunication services.  Then on January 25, 1995, 
the company and three other major telecommunications carriers in South-East Asia announced their 
<A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/asean.html"><B>plan</B></A> to 
coordinate the telecommunications needs of businesses in the region.  
"Telecommunications infrastructure plays a vital role in the region's 
economic development...our initial services will include intra-regional 
VSAT and private leased services and facilities management."  said the 
company spokesman.</P>  
<P>With this expansion of the nation's telecommunication 
service to the rest of the world and the company's belief in the 
importance of Information Technology, it is very likely Singapore will 
continue to preserve its position as a leader in international business 
and trade.  Telecom's vision to be a global company and investor will 
provide the infrastructure needed for it to become an efficient global 
information center in the future.</P>  
<P>At home, a challenge was given to more than 135 principals, teachers 
and MOE headquarter officers at a talk on 
<A HREF="http://www.moe.ac.sg/moe/pa/contact/vol02/c9cug.html"></B>Using 
Internet</B></A> on November 5th, 1994.  Fascinating information about the history of the Internet, popular 
services available via the Internet, and application of Internet in 
education was given, and every principal, teacher and officer was 
encouraged to incorporate the use of Internet into the school curriculum.
The promotion of Information Technology in education is aimed not only to 
improve the quality of education itself, but also to educate and familiarize 
the younger generation with advanced Information Technology.  SunSITE, 
Technet and Memex, with its strong focus on research and education, will be 
able to support the nation's goal in education.   Also, since the 
major Internet service is hosted by SunSITE at the University of 
Singapore, the plan to push the technology in and through education has 
already begun.  Such an ideal collaboration
between the major players of Information Technology, along with the 
unceasing support of the government, is sure to produce positive 
results.  </P>
<P>To some, this collaboration between the government and 
government-affiliated agencies strongly suggests a "monopoly" of the 
Information Technology service because it gives them too much control over 
the entire service offering.  It is therefore important that laws regulating 
the use and access of electronic information by home users, businesses 
AND the government are well thought-out and planned to prevend the abuse 
of such an efficient and powerful technology.</P>
