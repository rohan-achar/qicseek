First-Fit Interval Scheduling with Three Links and Deterministic
Service

Abstract: Following Coffman, Feldman, Kahale and Poonen, and Coffman,
Robert, and Stolyar, we consider the stability of first-fit queuing
systems for scheduling requests on an interval network.  Both Hajek's
theorem and fluid limits have been used as tools in the investigation
of stability.  We show how a variation of Hajek's theorem yields
a fairly simple analysis for the case of 3 links and deterministic
service.
