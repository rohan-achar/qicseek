		<H3>Course Description:</H3>
		<P>This course is an introduction to modern cryptography and security for graduates 
			and advanced undergraduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class will try to balance 
			between&nbsp;the breadth of the coverage and an attempt to develop a 
			general&nbsp;approach to&nbsp;the study of&nbsp;security issues.&nbsp; The 
			first aim of the class is to introduce students to various 
			cryptographic&nbsp;tools like&nbsp;symmetric and public-key encryption schemes, 
			signature schemes, message authentication schemes,&nbsp;identification 
			protocols, and others.&nbsp; The second and&nbsp;equally important&nbsp;aim of 
			this class is to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;"provable-security" paradigm of 
			approaching any communication security problem.&nbsp; This paradigm 
			consists&nbsp;of&nbsp;(1) understanding the security *goal* of any protocol, 
			i.e.&nbsp;understanding what properties a protocol needs to achieve to be 
			considered secure, and&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;designing a protocol together with a 
			*proof* that&nbsp;the protocol achieves these properties&nbsp;under some 
			well-understood computational hardness assumptions,&nbsp;for example under the 
			assumption that it is computationally hard to factor large composite numbers.</P>
		<P>The aim of the course is to introduce&nbsp;some fundamental&nbsp;cryptographic 
			tools in such a way so that&nbsp;(1) you will be able to&nbsp;specify the 
			security needs of the system you are designing and use&nbsp;existing 
			cryptographic mechanisms&nbsp;in such a way so that your security needs are 
			met, and&nbsp;(2) you will be able to develop new cryptographic mechanisms and 
			protocols yourself.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>To help further these goals, we'll end the class with conference-style 
			presentations by the *graduate* students on some&nbsp;security/cryptography 
			topic chosen by the student.</P>
		<H3>What this class is <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</I> about:</H3>
		<P>This class will not teach you all there is to know to make computers and 
			networks secure.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>
			Cryptography is only one layer in the stack of engineering issues that need to 
			be solved to make computers and networks secure.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>
			Computer security deals with lots of&nbsp;issues we will not touch on in the 
			class, like buggy code, viruses, denial of service attacks, network monitoring 
			techniques,&nbsp;preventing bad passwords, integrating various network services 
			securely, and many more.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;This class will </SPAN>
			&nbsp;stay firmly on the layer of&nbsp;algorithms for the so-called 
			"cryptographic&nbsp;primitives", i.e.&nbsp;the design of cryptographic tools 
			like encryption, signatures, authentication.&nbsp; While some of these tools 
			will be&nbsp;probably very useful in&nbsp;solving&nbsp;any of 
			the&nbsp;real-world security issues above, we will not be analyzing&nbsp;any 
			such systems in this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the&nbsp;other hand,&nbsp;we will 
			often mention the&nbsp;real-world security issues like those listed above 
			in&nbsp;motivating the security properties&nbsp;required of the cryptographic 
			tools we will be designing.</P>
		<P>Another note of warning is that in this class we will&nbsp;not concentrate on 
			techniques used to design and analyze block ciphers (like DES or AES) and hash 
			functions (like MD5 and SHA), although the class will offer you <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">
				some</I> insight into security of such constructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will 
			focus instead on public key crypto, but we will spend a&nbsp;few lectures on 
			private key algorithms too.</P>
		<H3>Grading policy:</H3>
		<P>Graduates:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			50% weekly&nbsp;problem sets
			<LI>
			25% take-home final
			<LI>
				25% a&nbsp;30 minute conference-style presentation&nbsp;on a 
				security/cryptography topic of your choice&nbsp;(the presentations will take 
				place&nbsp;in a a special class&nbsp;depending on the number of students 
				involved)</LI></UL>
		<P>Undergraduates:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			70% weekly&nbsp;problem sets
			<LI>
				30% take-home final
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>Problem sets are due at the beginning of the&nbsp;class.&nbsp; You are&nbsp;<STRONG>not 
				allowed</STRONG> to work on the homework problems together with other 
			students.&nbsp; You are also <STRONG>not&nbsp;allowed</STRONG> to 
			consult&nbsp;solutions from previous years or solutions available 
			on-line.&nbsp; You <STRONG>are</STRONG> allowed to consult other sources, such 
			as&nbsp;textbooks, lecture notes, or research papers, but you must clearly mark 
			any&nbsp;material you&nbsp;reference.</P>
		<H3>Textbook and lecture notes:</H3>
		<P>The (recommended) textbook is Douglas R. Stinson's "Cryptography: Theory and 
			Practice", which is available through&nbsp;the UCI bookstore.&nbsp; It 
			is&nbsp;very good&nbsp;as a reference&nbsp;for a lot of the material we will be 
			covering,&nbsp;but we will not follow it in great detail, and a lot of 
			the&nbsp;lecture material is&nbsp;not covered by Stinson.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>The primary source of the material will be&nbsp;the lecture notes and handouts 
			which I will be posting on the web and distributing in class.</P>
		<H3>Prerequisites:</H3>
		<P>The formal prerequisites are ICS 6.A and ICS.161.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, 
			what you really need in general is this:</P>
		<UL type="disc">
			<LI class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">
				You cannot be �math-phobic� or �theory-phobic�.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>
				The major focus of this class is on definitions and proofs, and we�ll 
				use&nbsp;probability and&nbsp;number theory in the running time analysis and 
				the security analysis of the&nbsp;algorithms we will study.</LI></UL>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">More 
			specifically, you need the following:</P>
		<UL type="disc">
			<LI class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">
			You should be comfortable with proofs, with elementary probability, and have 
			the basic&nbsp;knowledge of discrete math used in computer science 
			(e.g.&nbsp;ICS.6A).
			<LI class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">
			It's highly recommended that you have some algorithms class (like ICS.161), and 
			that you&nbsp;are familiar with asymptotic analysis of algorithm running time.
			<LI class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">
				It'd be also easier for you if you took a computability/complexity class like 
				ICS.162, so you are familiar with the notion of polynomial-time algorithms, and 
				the notion of&nbsp;a reduction between computational problems.
				<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>However, this is 
			material which we'll go over in this class to the extend that we'll use it, 
			and&nbsp;I believe that you can&nbsp;pick it up easily.
			<LI class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">
				You do not have to know modular arithmetic, because we will review everything 
				we will need.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;familiarity with it&nbsp;will be 
				helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to learn modular arithmetic on a deeper level, 
				consider the&nbsp;MATH.173A class taught every&nbsp;fall quarter by prof. Caryl 
				Margulies in the math department (see also below).</LI></UL>
		<H3>Other UCI classes on cryptography:</H3>
		<P>This class is complimentary to the MATH.173A - 173B&nbsp;classes on number 
			theory and cryptography which are taught by Prof. Margulies in the math 
			department.&nbsp; Having that class or any other preparation in number theory 
			is&nbsp;a very good background for this class, but it is not necessary.&nbsp; 
			However, if you think you'd like to&nbsp;work on cryptography and security, and 
			you do not have a strong background in number theory,&nbsp;I recommend that you 
			take both classes this quarter.&nbsp; Prof. Margulie's class is&nbsp;taught MWF 
			3-3:50 in ET 204, and the ICS students can&nbsp;either take it for a grade or 
			pass/fail as a special topic course,&nbsp;ICS.299.</P>
		<H3>Security Seminar Announcement:</H3>
		<P>Students who want to learn more about crypto/security are encouraged to attend a 
			weekly seminar of the SCONCE group, which takes place on Fridays 
			11:30-12:30,&nbsp;in&nbsp;ICS2 room 144.
