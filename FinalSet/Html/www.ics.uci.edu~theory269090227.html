<h1> A Separator Theorem For Planar Graphs
</h1>
<h2>
By Richard Lipton and Robert Tarjan 
</h2>
<h2> Presented by Lowell Trott, UC Irvine </h2>


<p>
Let G be any n-vertex planar graph. It will be shown that the vertices  
of G can be partitioned into three sets A,B,C such that no edge joins
a vertex in A with a vertex in B, neither A nor B  contains more than  
2n/3 vertices, and C contains no more that 2v(2n) vertices.  An  algorithm will be
presented which finds such a partition in O(n) time.
