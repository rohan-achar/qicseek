Bill Tomlinson is a Professor of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, and a researcher in the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology. 

He studies the fields of environmental informatics, human-computer interaction, multi-agent systems and computer-supported learning. 

His book <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Greening-through-Information-Environmental-Sustainability/dp/0262013932/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_1">Greening through IT</a> (MIT Press, 2010) examines the ways in which information technology can help people think and act on the broad scales of time, space, and complexity necessary for us to address the world's current environmental issues.  
In addition, he has authored dozens of papers across a range of journals and conferences in computing, the learning sciences, and the law.

His work has been reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the LA Times, Wired.com, Scientific American Frontiers, CNN, and the BBC.

In 2007, he received an <a href = "http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5262">NSF CAREER award</a>, and in 2008 he was selected as a <a href = "http://www.sloan.org/programs/scitech_fellowships.shtml">Sloan Research Fellow</a>.

He holds an A.B. in Biology from Harvard College, an M.F.A. in Experimental Animation from CalArts, and S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the MIT Media Lab.

Professor Tomlinson's <a href = "http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&ouml;s Number</a> is 4 (Erd&ouml;s, Specker, Lieberherr, Dourish, Tomlinson), 
and his <a href = "http://oracleofbacon.org/">Bacon Number</a> is <a href = http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/movielinks?game=0&firstname=Kevin+Bacon&secondname=Bill+Tomlinson&using=1&start_year=1850&end_year=2050&dir=0&use_genres=1&g0=on&g4=on&g8=on&g16=on&g20=on&g1=on&g5=on&g9=on&g13=on&g17=on&g21=on&g25=on&g2=on&g6=on&g10=on&g14=on&g22=on&g26=on&g3=on&g11=on&g15=on&g23=on&g27=on">3</a> (Bacon, Kornelis, Underhill, Tomlinson), thus making his  <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdos-Bacon_number">Erd&ouml;s-Bacon Number</a> a 7.  (Allowing for television, the Bacon Number drops to a 2 (Bacon, Alda, Tomlinson), and the Erd&ouml;s-Bacon Number drops to a 6.)

His animated film, Shaft of Light, screened at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and dozens of other film festivals around the world.

His 2009 paper with Andrew Torrance on patent systems has been cited in amicus briefs and in a writ filed with the United States Supreme Court.


He has also had the honor to share a lab with one of the world's most educated parrots (<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_%28parrot%29">Alex</a>), and to exchange nose-blows with one of the world's most educated sea lions (<a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2382489.stm">Rio</a>, video <a href = "http://youtu.be/mUS097juXG8">here</a>).



<!--
He has authored more than thirty scholarly publications over the last five years, including work at 

the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems conference, 
ACM CHI, ACM SIGGRAPH, 
the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning conference and numerous other conferences and journals. 
Previous interactive projects have been shown in the Emerging Technologies program at ACM SIGGRAPH ('97, '98, '99, '01, '05), at the Game Developers Conference, and at Ars Electronica, and have been reviewed by CNN, the Wall Street Journal, Sculpture Magazine, Scientific American Frontiers, the LA Times, Wired.com and the BBC. In 2007, he received an <a href = "http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5262">NSF CAREER award</a>, and in 2008 he was selected as a <a href = "http://www.sloan.org/programs/scitech_fellowships.shtml">Sloan Research Fellow</a>.
In addition his animated film, Shaft of Light, screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was distributed by the Anti-Defamation League in its Anti-Bias/Diversity Catalog. He holds an A.B. in Biology from Harvard College, an M.F.A. in Experimental Animation from CalArts, and S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the MIT Media Lab.
