The theorem of Pythagoras is said to have many proofs.

I've found four on the WWW (used with the Geometers SketchPad).  Are
there any sites with more, or sites with historical background on the
proofs?

There is of course a proof in Euclid's Elements, which can be found
online in a few places: here is the entry I have from my Geometry
Junkyard (<A HREF="http://www.ics.ici.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/">http://www.ics.ici.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/</A>), reformatted
somewhat from the original HTML:

  Euclid's Elements (<A HREF="http://www.columbia.edu/~rc142/Euclid.html">http://www.columbia.edu/~rc142/Euclid.html</A>).
  Online, in interesting colors, without all those annoying proofs.
  Also see D. Joyce's Java-animated version
  (<A HREF="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html">http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html</A>),
  and a manuscript excerpt from a copy in the Bodleian library made in the
  year 888 (<A HREF="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/science/parshall/elementsamp.html">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/science/parshall/elementsamp.html</A>).

Of those, Joyce's is the only one likely to have the proof you're looking for.
He also has pointers to more online copies of Euclid.

It wouldn't hurt to try reading a few actual books, too, as well as just
looking online -- contrary to appearances there's a lot of knowledge out
there that hasn't been put on the web yet.  Most of my geometry books
are in my office, but I just took a look at The Penguin Dictionary of
Curious and Interesting Geometry, by David Wells, which has the exact
citation to Euclid (book I, prop. 47), gives a Chinese proof from before
200BC, and says "far more proofs have been offered of Euclid's theorem
than of any other proposition in mathematics" (maybe true but it's
hardly the only statement with many proofs; see e.g. my page on Euler's
formula, <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/</A>).  Wells does
list several other proofs and gives citations for more including a 1940
book with 367 of them!

Some more historical background on the Pythagorean theorem can be found
in Dirk Struik's Consise History of Mathematics, which includes for
instance a statement that there is no evidence of ancient Egyptian
knowledge of the theorem (contra folklore that they used 3-4-5 triangles
to measure right angles).  Struik does say though that the theorem was
known to the Babylonians and ancient Chinese, although "the first
general proof may have been obtained in the Pythagorean school".

Hi David,

I found this on your plane geometry page.

You might like to add to it that there is a site with 23 proofs
of the Pythagorean theorem! The URL is:
