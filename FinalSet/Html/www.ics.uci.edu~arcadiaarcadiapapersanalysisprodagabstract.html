<H2> Abstract </H2>

ProDAG is an analysis toolset that provides an application programmatic 
interface for program dependence analysis. Program dependences are 
syntactic relationships between program statements. The ProDAG interface 
provides a uniform set of operations for creating and accessing several 
pre-defined dependence relations, which are represented as graphs, as 
well as a standard mechanism for developing new dependence graphs. ProDAG 
is one analysis toolset in Arcadia.  ProDAG was developed in the Arcadia 
environment and has been integrated with the language processing, object 
management, and process definition components of the Arcadia architecture,
and further integration with the user interface development system and 
the measurement and evaluation components are underway. This paper 
describes the design, implementation and integration of ProDAG within 
Arcadia.
