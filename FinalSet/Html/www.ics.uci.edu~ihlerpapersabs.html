<p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are extremely useful for modeling and solving
sequential decision making problems.  Graph-based MDPs provide a compact
representation for MDPs with large numbers of random variables.  However, the
complexity of exactly solving a graph-based MDP usually grows exponentially in
the number of variables, which limits their application.  We present a new
variational framework to describe and solve the planning problem of MDPs, and
derive both exact and approximate planning algorithms.  In particular, by
exploiting the graph structure of graph-based MDPs, we propose a factored
variational value iteration algorithm in which the value function is first
approximated by the multiplication of local-scope value functions, then solved
by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.  The KL divergence is
optimized using the belief propagation algorithm, with complexity exponential
in only the cluster size of the graph.  Experimental comparison on different
models shows that our algorithm outperforms existing approximation algorithms
at finding good policies.

<p>We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices,
probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach.  A
challenging aspect of combining the crowd's answers is that workers'
reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse.  Control items
with known answers can be used to evaluate workers' performance, and hence improve
the combined results on the target items with unknown answers.  This raises the
problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can
answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves
fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa.
We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and
provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners.  As a byproduct,
we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different
consensus methods.

<p>Maximum Likelihood learning of graphical models is not possible in problems
where inference is intractable. In such settings it is common to use
approximate inference (e.g. Loopy BP) and maximize the so-called ``surrogate''
likelihood objective. We examine the effect of using different
approximate inference methods and, therefore, different surrogate likelihoods,
on the accuracy of parameter estimation. In particular, we consider
methods that utilize a control parameter to trade
computation for accuracy. We demonstrate empirically that cheaper, but worse
quality approximate inference methods should be used in the small data setting
as they exhibit smaller variance and are more robust to model mis-specification.

<p>Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference is one of the fundamental inference tasks
in graphical models. MAP inference is in general NP-hard, making approximate
methods of interest for many problems. One successful class of approximate
inference algorithms is based on linear programming (LP) relaxations. The
augmented Lagrangian method can be used to overcome a lack of strict convexity
in LP relaxations, and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
provides an elegant algorithm for finding the saddle point of the augmented
Lagrangian. Here we present an ADMM-based algorithm to solve the primal form of
the MAP-LP whose closed form updates are based on a linear approximation
technique. Our technique gives efficient, closed form updates that converge to
the global optimum of the LP relaxation. We compare our algorithm to two
existing ADMM-based MAP-LP methods, showing that our technique is faster on
general, non-binary or non-pairwise models.

<p>The marginal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, which
calculates the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of a subset of
variables with the remaining variables marginalized, is an important inference
problem in many models, such as those with hidden variables or uncertain
parameters. Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has
attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP
(maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual
representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization
and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem,
making it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to
marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of “mixed-product" message passing
algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product
and a novel “argmax-product" message updates. We also derive a class of
convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that
transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization
problems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give
globally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the
optimal objectives. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms
significantly outperform the existing approaches, including a state-of-the-art
algorithm based on local search methods.

<p>Earlier work has explored enhancing the perceived resolution of a display by
shifting multiple different low-resolution images by fractions of a pixel and
overlaying them in a temporally multiplexed fashion. This increases the
manufacturing cost and also sacrifices the temporal resolution that can
compromise other capabilities like 3D active stereo. In this paper we propose a
method to achieve the same goal in projectors by performing the pixel shift and
superposition optically by introducing a simple and inexpensive optical
ensemble of a set of lenses on the projector light path. This does not
sacrifice the temporal resolution and is extremely easy to implement in
practice.

However, instead of overlaying different images, we overlay an image with one
or more sub-pixel shifted copies of itself.  Therefore, we seek a single n × n
image which when shifted and overlaid with itself creates a perceptually closer
to a higher resolution 2n × 2n target image. This changes the optimization
formulation significantly and requires solving a system of sparse linear
equations. We take advantage of this sparsity and design a parallel
implementation of this optimization in GPUs for real-time computation of the
input image critical for its practical implementation. But, since this system
is more constrained that using multiple overlaid images, the enhancement of
resolution is compromised. However, since the optical design is very simple
and inexpensive, it can be deployed on a variety of low-cost projectors and
still offer a significant image quality benefit.

<p>Crowdsourcing has become a popular paradigm for labeling large datasets.
However, it has given rise to the computational task of aggregating the
crowdsourced labels provided by a collection of unreliable annotators. We
approach this problem by transforming it into a standard inference problem in
graphical models, and applying approximate variational methods, including
belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF).  We show that our BP algorithm
generalizes both majority voting and a recent algorithm by Karger et al.
(2011), while our MF method is closely related to a commonly used EM algorithm.
In both case, we find that the performance of the algorithms critically depends
on the choice of a prior distribution on the workers' reliability; by choosing
the prior properly, both BP and MF (and EM) perform surprisingly well on both
simulated and real-world datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms
based on more complicated modeling assumptions.

<p>This paper describes our entry for the MAP/MPE track of the PASCAL 2011
Probabilistic Inference Challenge, which placed first in all three time limit 
categories, 20 seconds, 20 minutes, and 1 hour. Our baseline is a branch-and-bound
algorithm that explores the AND/OR context-minimal search graph of a graphical
model guided by a mini-bucket heuristic. Augmented with recent advances that
convert the algorithm into an anytime scheme, that improve the heuristic power
via cost-shifting schemes, and using enhanced variable ordering schemes, it 
constitutes one of the most powerful MAP/MPE inference methods to date.

<p>We describe a new optimization scheme for finding high-quality correlation

producing high-quality segmentations.

<p>The track-oriented multiple hypothesis tracker is currently the preferred
method for tracking multiple targets in clutter with medium to high
computational resources. This method maintains a structured representation of
the track posterior distribution, which it repeatedly extends and optimizes
over.  This representation of the posterior admits probabilistic inference
tasks beyond MAP estimation that have yet to be explored.  To this end we
formulate the posterior as a graphical model and show that belief propagation
can be used to approximate the track marginals.  These approximate marginals
enable an online parameter estimation scheme that improves tracker performance
in the presence of parameter misspecification.

<p>We develop several algorithms taking advantage of two common approaches for
bounding MPE queries in graphical models: mini-bucket elimination and
message-passing updates for linear programming relaxations.  Both methods are
quite similar, and offer useful perspectives for the other; our hybrid
approaches attempt to balance the advantages of each.  We demonstrate the power
of our hybrid algorithms through extensive empirical evaluation.  Most notably,
a Branch and Bound search guided by the heuristic function calculated by one of
our new algorithms has recently won first place in the PASCAL2 inference
challenge.

<p>We introduce a new cluster-cumulant expansion (CCE) based on the fixed points
of iterative belief propagation (IBP). This expansion is similar in spirit to
the loop-series (LS) recently introduced in Chertkov and Chernyak (2006). However,
in contrast to the latter, the CCE enjoys the following important qualities: 1)
it is defined for arbitrary state spaces 2) it is easily extended to fixed
points of generalized belief propagation (GBP), 3)  disconnected groups of
variables will not contribute to the CCE and 4) the accuracy of the expansion
empirically improves upon that of the LS. The CCE is based on the same
Mobius transform as the Kikuchi approximation, but unlike GBP does not
require storing the beliefs of the GBP-clusters nor does it suffer from
convergence issues during belief updating.

<p>Variational inference algorithms such as belief propagation have had tremendous
impact on our ability to learn and use graphical models, and give many insights
for developing or understanding exact and approximate inference.  However,
variational approaches have not been widely adoped for <i>decision making</i>
in graphical models, often formulated through influence diagrams and including
both centralized and decentralized (or multi-agent) decisions.  In this work,
we present a general variational framework for solving structured cooperative decision-making
problems, use it to propose several belief propagation-like algorithms, and
analyze them both theoretically and empirically.

<p>We study the marginal-MAP problem on graphical models, and present a novel
approximation method based on direct approximation of the sum operation.  A
primary difficulty of marginal-MAP problems lies in the non-commutativity of
the sum and max operations, so that even in highly structured models,
marginalization may produce a densely connected graph over the variables to be
maximized, resulting in an intractable potential function with exponential
size.  We propose a chain decomposition approach for summing over the
marginalized variables, in which we produce a structured approximation to the
MAP component of the problem consisting of only pairwise potentials.  We show
that this approach is equivalent to the maximization of a specific variational
free energy, and it provides an upper bound of the optimal probability.
Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably
compared to previous methods.

<p>The role of the circadian clock in skin and the identity of genes participating
in its chronobiology remain largely unknown, leading us to define the circadian
transcriptome of mouse skin at two different stages of the hair cycle, telogen
and anagen. The circadian transcriptomes of telogen and anagen skin are largely
distinct, with the former dominated by genes involved in cell proliferation and
metabolism. The expression of many metabolic genes is antiphasic to cell
cycle-related genes, the former peaking during the day and the latter at night.
Consistently, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, a byproduct of oxidative
phosphorylation, and S-phase are antiphasic to each other in telogen skin.
Furthermore, the circadian variation in S-phase is controlled by BMAL1
intrinsic to keratinocytes, because keratinocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1
obliterates time-of-day–dependent synchronicity of cell division in the
epidermis leading to a constitutively elevated cell proliferation. In agreement
with higher cellular susceptibility to UV-induced DNA damage during S-phase, we
found that mice are most sensitive to UVB-induced DNA damage in the epidermis
at night. Because in the human epidermis maximum numbers of keratinocytes go
through S-phase in the late afternoon, we speculate that in humans the
circadian clock imposes regulation of epidermal cell proliferation so that skin
is at a particularly vulnerable stage during times of maximum UV exposure, thus
contributing to the high incidence of human skin cancers.

<p>Estimating statistical models within sensor networks requires distributed
algorithms, in which both data and computation are distributed across the nodes
of the network. We propose a general approach for distributed learning based on
combining local estimators defined by pseudo-likelihood components,
encompassing a number of combination methods, and provide both theoretical and
experimental analysis.  We show that simple linear combination or max-voting
methods, when combined with second-order information, are statistically
competitive with more advanced and costly joint optimization. Our algorithms
have many attractive properties including low communication and computational
cost and "any-time" behavior.

<p>We investigate a hybrid of two styles of algorithms for deriving bounds for 
optimization tasks over graphical models: non-iterative message-passing schemes
exploiting variable duplication to reduce cluster sizes (e.g. MBE) and iterative
methods that re-parameterize the problem's functions aiming to produce good
bounds even if functions are processed independently (e.g. MPLP). In this work
we combine both ideas, augmenting MBE with re-parameterization, which we call
MBE with Moment Matching (MBE-MM). The results of preliminary empirical
evaluations show the clear promise of the hybrid scheme over its individual com-
ponents (e.g., pure MBE and pure MPLP). Most significantly, we demonstrate the
potential of the new bounds in improving the power of mechanically generated
heuristics for branch and bound search.

<p>Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving
variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce
new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As
the model is updated, the goal of \emph{adaptive inference} is to
take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform
inference more rapidly than from scratch.  In this paper, we present
algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can
be used to efficiently compute marginals and update MAP
configurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and
its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing
step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation
of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input
model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be
used to update MAP configurations in time that is roughly
proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size
of the input model.  
To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our
algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as
for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that
adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing
complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>  Dual-decomposition (DD) methods are quickly becoming important tools
  for estimating the minimum energy state of a graphical model.  DD
  methods decompose a complex model into a collection of simpler
  subproblems that can be solved exactly (such as trees), that in
  combination provide upper and lower bounds on the exact solution.
  Subproblem choice can play a major role:
  larger subproblems tend to improve the bound more per iteration,
  while smaller subproblems enable highly parallel solvers and can
  benefit from re-using past solutions when there are few changes
  between iterations.

  We propose an algorithm that can balance many of these aspects to
  speed up convergence.  Our method uses a cluster tree
  data structure that has been proposed for adaptive exact inference
  tasks, and we apply it in this paper to dual-decomposition
  approximate inference.  This approach allows us to process large
  subproblems to improve the bounds at each iteration, while allowing
  a high degree of parallelizability and taking advantage of
  subproblems with sparse updates.
  For both synthetic inputs and a real-world stereo matching problem,
  we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to achieve significant
  improvement in convergence time.

<p>We describe a new technique for computing lower-bounds on the minimum energy
configuration of a planar Markov Random Field (MRF).  Our method successively
adds large numbers of constraints and enforces consistency over binary
projections of the original problem state space.  These constraints are
represented in terms of subproblems in a dual-decomposition framework that is
optimized using subgradient techniques.  The complete set of constraints we
consider enforces cycle consistency over the original graph.  In practice we
find that the method converges quickly on most problems with the addition of a
few subproblems and outperforms existing methods for some interesting classes
of hard potentials.

<p>We describe a new variational lower-bound on the minimum energy configuration
of a planar binary Markov Random Field (MRF).  Our method is based on adding
auxiliary nodes to every face of a planar embedding of the graph in order to
capture the effect of unary potentials.  A ground state of the resulting
approximation can be computed efficiently by reduction to minimum-weight
perfect matching. We show that optimization of variational parameters achieves
the same lower-bound as dual-decomposition into the set of all cycles of the
original graph.  We demonstrate that our variational optimization converges
quickly and provides high-quality solutions to hard combinatorial problems
10-100x faster than competing algorithms that optimize the same bound.

<p>Marginal MAP problems are notoriously difficult tasks for graphical models. We

and obtain novel upper bounds on solutions.

a special case of our framework.

<p>Given a graphical model, one of the most useful queries is to find the most
likely configuration of its variables.  This task, known as the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) problem, can be solved efficiently via message passing
techniques when the graph is a tree, but is NP-hard for general graphs.
Jebara (2009) shows that the MAP problem can be converted into the
stable set problem, which can be solved in polynomial time for a broad class of
graphs known as perfect graphs via a linear programming relaxation technique.
This is a result of great theoretical interest.  However, the article
additionally claims that max-product linear programming (MPLP) message passing
techniques of Globerson & Jaakkola (2007) are also guaranteed to solve these
problems exactly and efficiently.  We investigate this claim, show that it does
not hold in general, and attempt to repair it with several alternative message
passing algorithms.

<p>Multicore computing is on the rise, but algorithms such as Gibbs sampling are
fundamentally sequential and may require close consideration to be made
parallel.  Existing techniques either exploit sparse problem structure or make
approximations to the algorithm; in this work, we explore an alternative to
these ideas.  We develop a parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm for shared-memory
systems that does not require any independence structure among the variables
yet does not approximate the sampling distributions.  Our method uses a
look-ahead sampler, which uses bounds to attempt to sample variables before the
results of other threads are made available.  We demonstrate our algorithm on
Gibbs sampling in Boltzmann machines and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).  We
show in experiments that our algorithm achieves near linear speed-up in the
number of cores, is faster than existing exact samplers, and is nearly as fast
as approximate samplers while maintaining the correct stationary distribution.

<p>Methods for L1-type regularization have been widely used in Gaussian
graphical model selection tasks to encourage sparse structures. However, often
we would like to include more structural information than mere sparsity. In
this work, we focus on learning so-called ``scale-free'' models, a common
feature that appears in many real-work networks. We replace the L1
regularization with a power law regularization and  optimize the objective
function by a sequence of iteratively reweighted L1 regularization
problems, where the regularization coefficients of nodes with high degree are
reduced, encouraging the appearance of hubs with high degree. Our method can be
easily adapted to improve <i>any</i> existing L1-based methods, such as
graphical lasso, neighborhood selection, and JSRM when the underlying networks
are believed to be scale free or have dominating hubs. We demonstrate in
simulation that our method significantly outperforms the a baseline L1
method at learning scale-free networks and hub networks, and also illustrate
its behavior on gene expression data.

<p>Continuous quantities are ubiquitous in models of real-world phenomena,
but are surprisingly difficult to reason about automatically.  Probabilistic
graphical models such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields,
and algorithms for approximate inference such as belief propagation,
have proven to be powerful
tools in a wide range of applications in statistics and artificial intelligence.
However, applying these methods to models with continuous variables remains
a challenging task.  In this work we describe an extension of belief propagation
to continuous variable models, generalizing particle filtering and Gaussian mixture
filtering techniques for time series to more complex models.  We illustrate the
power of the resulting nonparametric belief propagation algorithm via two applications:
kinematic tracking of visual motion and distributed localization in sensor networks.

is a lower-bound counterpart to the tree-reweighted belief propagation algorithm,
which uses a convex combination of spanning trees with positive weights to
provide corresponding upper bounds.  We develop algorithms to optimize and
tighten the lower bounds over the non-convex set of valid parameter values. 
Our algorithm generalizes mean field approaches (including na\"ive and 
structured mean field approximations), which it includes as a limiting case.

<p>Many computer vision problems involving feature correspondence among images can
be formulated as an assignment problem with a quadratic cost function. Such
problems are computationally infeasible in general but recent advances in
discrete optimization such as tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRW) 
often provide high-quality solutions.  In this paper, we improve upon
these algorithms in two ways.  First, we introduce covering trees, a variant of
TRW which provide the same bounds on the MAP energy as TRW with far fewer
variational parameters. Optimization of these parameters can be carried out
efficiently using either fixed--point iterations (as in TRW) or sub-gradient
based techniques.  Second, we introduce a new technique that utilizes bipartite
matching applied to the min-marginals produced with covering trees in order to
compute a tighter lower-bound for the quadratic assignment problem.  We apply
this machinery to the problem of finding correspondences with pairwise energy
functions, and demonstrate the resulting hybrid method outperforms TRW alone
and a recent related subproblem decomposition algorithm on benchmark image
correspondence problems.

<p>Learning undirected graphical models such as Markov random fields is an
important machine learning task with applications in many domains.
Since it is usually intractable to learn these models exactly, various 
approximate learning techniques have been developed, such as contrastive 
divergence (CD) and Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation 
(MCMC-MLE).  In this paper, we introduce particle filtered MCMC-MLE, which is 
a sampling-importance-resampling version of MCMC-MLE with 
additional MCMC rejuvenation steps.  
We also describe a unified view of (1) MCMC-MLE, (2) our particle filtering approach,
and (3) a stochastic approximation procedure known as persistent contrastive
divergence.  We show how these approaches are related to each other
and discuss the relative merits of each approach.
Empirical results on various undirected models demonstrate that 
the particle filtering technique we propose in this paper
can significantly outperform MCMC-MLE.  Furthermore, in certain 
cases, the proposed technique is faster than persistent CD.

show that composite likelihoods can be stochastically optimized by performing a 
variant of contrastive divergence with random-scan blocked Gibbs sampling. By using 
higher-order composite likelihoods, our proposed learning framework makes it 
possible to trade off computation time for increased accuracy. Furthermore, one can 
choose composite likelihood blocks that match the model's dependence structure, 
making the optimization of higher-order composite likelihoods computationally 
efficient.  We empirically analyze the performance of blocked contrastive 
divergence on various models, including visible Boltzmann machines, conditional 
random fields, and exponential random graph models, and we demonstrate that using 
higher-order blocks improves both the accuracy of parameter estimates and the rate 
of convergence.

<p><b>Motivation:</b> Time-course gene expression datasets provide important insights into dynamic aspects of biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, cell cycle and organ development. In a typical microarray time-course experiment, measurements are obtained at each time point from multiple replicate samples. Accurately recovering the gene expression patterns from experimental observations is made challenging by both measurement noise and variation among replicates' rates of development. Prior work on this topic has focused on inference of expression patterns assuming that the replicate times are synchronized. We develop a statistical approach that simultaneously infers both (i) the underlying (hidden) expression profile for each gene, as well as (ii) the biological time for each individual replicate. Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) combined with a probabilistic model that accounts for uncertainty about the biological development time of each replicate.
<br>
<b>Results:</b> We apply GPR with uncertain measurement times to a microarray dataset of mRNA expression for the hair-growth cycle in mouse back skin, predicting both profile shapes and biological times for each replicate. The predicted time shifts show high consistency with independently obtained morphological estimates of relative development. We also show that the method systematically reduces prediction error on out-of-sample data, significantly reducing the mean squared error in a cross-validation study.

<p>Since the development of loopy belief propagation, there has been considerable
work on advancing the state of the art for approximate inference over
distributions defined on discrete random variables. Improvements include
guarantees of convergence, approximations that are provably more accurate, and
bounds on the results of exact inference.  However, extending these methods  to
continuous-valued systems has lagged behind.  While several methods have been
developed to use belief propagation on systems with continuous values, recent 
advances for discrete variables have not as yet been incorporated.

In this context we extend a recently proposed particle-based belief propagation
algorithm to provide a general framework for adapting discrete message-passing
algorithms to inference in continuous systems.  The resulting
algorithms behave similarly to their purely discrete counterparts, extending
the benefits of these more advanced inference techniques to the continuous
domain.

<p>Many applications involve repeatedly computing the optimal, maximum
<i>a posteriori</i> (MAP) configuration of a graphical model as the
model changes, often slowly or incrementally over time, e.g., due to
input from a user.
Small changes to the model often require
updating only a small fraction of the MAP configuration, suggesting
the possibility of performing updates faster than recomputing from
scratch.
In this paper we present an algorithm for efficiently performing such
updates under arbitrary changes to the model.
Our algorithm is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal and is
asymptotically never slower than re-computing from-scratch: if a
modification to the model requires $m$ updates to the MAP
configuration of $n$ random variables, then our algorithm requires
$O(m\log{(n/m)})$ time; re-computing from scratch requires $O(n)$
time.
We evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithm by
considering two problems in genomic signal processing, CpG region
segmentation and protein sidechain packing, where a MAP configuration
must be repeatedly updated.  Our results show significant speedups
over recomputing from scratch.

changes in hair growth. Understanding the regulation of hair follicle cycling
is also of interest because abnormal regulation of hair cycle control genes is
responsible for several types of human hair growth disorders and skin cancers.
We report here that <i>Clock</i> and <i>Bmal1</i> genes,
which control circadian rhythms, are also important for the regulation of hair
follicle cycling, a biological process of much longer duration than 24 hours.
Detailed analysis of skin from mice mutated for central clock genes indicates a
significant delay in the progression of the hair growth phase. We show that
clock genes affect the expression of key cell cycle control genes and that
keratinocytes in a critical compartment of the hair follicles in
<i>Bmal1</i> mutant mice are halted in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle. These findings provide novel insight into circadian control mechanisms
in modulating the progression of cyclic biological processes on different time
scales.

<p>The popularity of particle filtering for inference in Markov chain
models defined over random variables with very large or continuous
domains makes it natural to consider sample--based versions of belief
propagation (BP) for more general (tree--structured or loopy) graphs.
Already, several such algorithms have been proposed in the
literature.  However, many questions remain open about the behavior
of particle--based BP algorithms, and little theory
has been developed to analyze their performance.
In this paper, we describe a generic particle belief propagation (PBP)
algorithm which is closely related to previously proposed methods.
We prove that this algorithm is consistent, approaching the true BP
messages as the number of samples grows large.
We then use concentration bounds to analyze the finite-sample
behavior and give a convergence rate for the algorithm on
tree--structured graphs.  Our convergence rate is $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
where $n$ is the number of samples, independent of the domain size
of the variables.

<p>In this paper we introduce a novel collapsed Gibbs sampling method for the
widely used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Our
new method results in significant speedups on real world text
corpora. Conventional Gibbs sampling schemes for LDA require
O(K) operations per sample where K is the number of
topics in the model. Our proposed method draws equivalent
samples but requires on average significantly less then K operations per sample.
On real-word corpora FastLDA can be as much as 8
times faster than the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler for LDA. No approximations are
necessary, and we show that our fast sampling
scheme produces exactly the same results as the standard
(but slower) sampling scheme. Experiments on four real world
data sets demonstrate speedups for a wide range of
collection sizes. For the PubMed collection of over 8 million
documents with a required computation time of 6 CPU months for LDA,
our speedup of 5.7 can save 5 CPU months of computation.

<p> Time-series of count data occur in many different contexts, including Internet navigation logs, freeway traffic monitoring, and security logs associated with buildings. In this article we describe a framework for detecting anomalous events in such data using an unsupervised learning approach. Normal periodic behavior is modeled via a time-varying Poisson process model, which in turn is modulated by a hidden Markov process that accounts for bursty events. We outline a Bayesian framework for learning the parameters of this model from count time-series. Two large real-world datasets of time-series counts are used as testbeds to validate the approach, consisting of freeway traffic data and logs of people entering and exiting a building. We show that the proposed model is significantly more accurate at detecting known events than a more traditional threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and to make inferences about different aspects of events such as number of vehicles or people involved. The results indicate that the Markov-modulated Poisson framework provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.

<p>The belief propagation algorithm is widely applied to perform
approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models, in part due to
its excellent empirical properties and performance. However, little
is known theoretically about when this algorithm will perform well.
Using recent analysis of convergence and stability properties in
belief propagation and new results on approximations in binary
systems, we derive a bound on the error in BP's estimates for
pairwise Markov random fields over discrete--valued random variables.
Our bound is relatively simple to compute, and compares favorably
with a previous method for bounding the accuracy of
belief propagation.

<p>In data assimilation for a system which evolves in time, one combines past and current observations with a model of the dynamics of the
system, in order to improve the simulation of the system as well as any future predictions about it. From a statistical point of view, this process can
be regarded as estimating many random variables which are related both spatially and temporally: given observations of some of these variables,
typically corresponding to times past, we require estimates of several others, typically corresponding to future times.
<p>
Graphical models have emerged as an effective formalism for assisting in these types of inference tasks, particularly for large numbers of
random variables. Graphical models provide a means of representing dependency structure among the variables, and can provide both intuition
and efficiency in estimation and other inference computations. We provide an overview and introduction to graphical models, and describe how
they can be used to represent statistical dependency and how the resulting structure can be used to organize computation. The relation between
statistical inference using graphical models and optimal sequential estimation algorithms such as Kalman filtering is discussed. We then give
several additional examples of how graphical models can be applied to climate dynamics, specifically estimation using multi-resolution models of
large-scale data sets such as satellite imagery, and learning hidden Markov models to capture rainfall patterns in space and time.

<p>Data sets that characterize human activity over time through collections of timestamped
events or counts are of increasing interest in application areas as humancomputer
interaction, video surveillance, and Web data analysis. We propose a
non-parametric Bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data. In
particular, we use a Dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity
functions corresponding to different categories, which form a basis set for representing
individual time-periods (e.g., several days) depending on which categories
the time-periods are assigned to. This allows the model to learn in a data-driven
fashion what factors are generating the observations on a particular day, including
(for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-specific effects corresponding
to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information
where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated
with each category. Applications to realworld data sets of count data involving
both vehicles and people are used to illustrate the technique.

<p>Time-series of count data are generated in many different contexts, such as web access logging, freeway traffic monitoring, and security logs associated with buildings. Since this data measures the aggregated behavior of individual human beings, it typically exhibits a periodicity in time on a number of scales (daily, weekly,etc.) that reflects the rhythms of the underlying human activity and makes the data appear non-homogeneous. At the same time, the data is often corrupted by a number of bursty periods of unusual behavior such as building events, traffic accidents, and so forth. The data mining problem of finding and extracting these anomalous events is made difficult by both of these elements. In this paper we describe a framework for unsupervised learning in this context, based on a time-varying Poisson process model that can also account for anomalous events. We show how the parameters of this model can be learned from count time series using statistical estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this model on two datasets for which we have partial ground truth in the form of known events, one from freeway traffic data and another from building access data, and show that the model performs significantly better than a non-probabilistic, threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and make inferences about the detected events (e.g., popularity or level of attendance). Our experimental results indicate that the proposed time-varying Poisson model provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.

<p>Nonparametric Bayesian approaches to clustering,
information retrieval, language modeling
and object recognition have recently shown great
promise as a new paradigm for unsupervised data
analysis. Most contributions have focused on the
Dirichlet process mixture models or extensions
thereof for which efficient Gibbs samplers exist.
In this paper we explore Gibbs samplers for
infinite complexity mixture models in the stick
breaking representation. The advantage of this
representation is improved modeling flexibility.
For instance, one can design the prior distribution
over cluster sizes or couple multiple infi-
nite mixture models (e.g., over time) at the level
of their parameters (i.e., the dependent Dirichlet
process model). However, Gibbs samplers for in-
finite mixture models (as recently introduced in
the statistics literature) seem to mix poorly over
cluster labels. Among others issues, this can have
the adverse effect that labels for the same cluster
in coupled mixture models are mixed up. We
introduce additional moves in these samplers to
improve mixing over cluster labels and to bring
clusters into correspondence. An application to
modeling of storm trajectories is used to illustrate
these ideas.

<p>Distributed inference methods developed for graphical models comprise a principled
approach for data fusion in sensor networks. The application of these methods, however,
requires some care due to a number of issues that are particular to sensor networks.
Chief of among these are the distributed nature of computation and
deployment coupled with communications bandwidth and energy constraints typical
of many sensor networks. Additionally, information sharing in a sensor network necessarily
involves approximation. Traditional measures of distortion are not sufficient to characterize the
quality of approximation as they do not address in an explicit manner the resulting impact on inference
which is at the core of many data fusion problems. While both graphical models and a distributed
sensor network have network structures associated with them, the mapping is not one to one.
All of these issues complicate the mapping of a particular inference problem to a given sensor network
structure. Indeed, there may be a variety of mappings with very different characteristics with
regard to computational complexity and utilization of resources. Nevertheless, it is the case that
many of the powerful distributed inference methods have a role in information fusion for sensor
networks. In this article we present an overview of research conducted by the authors that has
sought to clarify many of the important issues at the intersection
of these domains. We discuss both theoretical issues and prototypical
applications in addition to suggesting new lines of reasoning.

<p>Particle filtering is often applied to the problem of object tracking
under non-Gaussian uncertainty; however, sensor networks frequently
require that the implementation be local to the region of interest,
eventually forcing the large, sample-based representation to be moved
among power-constrained sensors. We consider the problem of successive
approximation (i.e., lossy compression) of each sample-based density
estimate, in particular exploring the consequences (both theoretical and
empirical) of several possible choices of loss function and their
interpretation in terms of future errors in inference, justifying their
use for measuring approximations in distributed particle filtering.

<p>Automatic self-localization is a critical need for the effective use of
ad-hoc sensor networks in military or civilian applications.  In general,
self-localization involves the combination of absolute location
information (\eg GPS) with relative calibration information (\eg distance
measurements between sensors) over regions of the network. Furthermore, it
is generally desirable to distribute the computational burden across the
network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor communication.  We
demonstrate that the information used for sensor localization is
fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and use this
observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework.
We then present and demonstrate the utility of \emph{nonparametric belief
propagation} (NBP), a recent generalization of particle filtering, for
both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties.
NBP has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed
fashion, admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent
multi-modal uncertainty. Using simulations of small- to moderately-sized
sensor networks, we show that NBP may be made robust to outlier
measurement errors by a simple model augmentation, and that judicious
message construction can result in better estimates. Furthermore, we
provide an analysis of NBP's communications requirements, showing that
typically only a few messages per sensor are required, and that even low
bit-rate approximations of these messages can have little or no
performance impact.

<p>Determining the structure of dependencies among a set of variables is a
common task in many signal and image processing applications, including
multi-target tracking and computer vision.  In this paper we present an
information-theoretic, machine learning approach to problems of this type.
We cast this problem as a hypothesis test between factorizations of
variables into mutually independent subsets. We show that the likelihood
ratio can be written as sums of two sets of Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence terms. The first set captures the structure of the statistical
dependencies within each hypothesis, while the second set measures the
details of model differences between hypotheses.  We then consider the
case when the signal prior models are unknown, so that the distributions
of interest must be estimated directly from data, showing that the second
set of terms is (asymptotically) negligible and quantifying the loss in
hypothesis separability when the models are completely unknown.  We
demonstrate the utility of nonparametric estimation methods for such
problems, providing a general framework for determining and distinguishing
between dependency structures in highly uncertain environments.
Additionally, we develop a machine learning approach for estimating lower
bounds on KL-divergence and mutual information from samples of
high-dimensional random variables for which direct density estimation is
infeasible. We present empirical results in the context of three
prototypical applications: association of signals generated by sources
possessing harmonic behavior, scene correspondence using video imagery,
and detection of coherent behavior among sets of moving objects.

<p>In many applications, particularly power-constrained sensor networks, it is important to
conserve the amount of data exchanged while maximizing the utility of that data for some

size (in distributed networks, the communications cost) and the error incurred by its use (the
inference cost).
<p>    We analyze this tradeoff for a particular problem: communicating a particle-based 
representation (and more generally, a Gaussian mixture or kernel density estimate). We begin by
characterizing the exact communication cost of these representations, noting that it is less than
might be suggested by traditional communications theory due to the invariance of the represen-
tation to reordering. We describe the optimal, lossless encoder when the generating distribution
is known, and pose a sub-optimal encoder which still benefits from reordering invariance.
<p>    However, lossless encoding may not be sufficient. We describe one reasonable measure of
error for distribution-based messages and its consequences for inference in an acyclic network,
and propose a novel density approximation method based on KD-tree multiscale representations
which enables the communications cost and a bound on error to be balanced efficiently. We
show several empirical examples demonstrating the method’s utility in collaborative, distributed
signal processing under bandwidth or power constraints.

<p>Automatic self-calibration of ad-hoc sensor networks is a critical need
for their use in military or civilian applications.  In general,
self-calibration involves the combination of absolute location information
(e.g. GPS) with relative calibration information (e.g. estimated distance
between sensors) over regions of the network. We formulate the
self-calibration problem as a graphical model, enabling application of
nonparametric belief propagation (NBP), a recent generalization of
particle filtering, for both estimating sensor locations and representing
location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage that it is easily
implemented in a distributed fashion, can represent multi-modal
uncertainty, and admits a wide variety of statistical models.   This last
point is particularly appealing in that it can be used to provide
robustness against occasional high-variance (outlier) noise.  We
illustrate the performance of NBP using Monte Carlo analysis on an example
network.

<p>Automatic self-calibration of ad-hoc sensor networks is a critical need
for their use in military or civilian applications.  In general,
self-calibration involves the combination of absolute location information
(e.g. GPS) with relative calibration information (e.g. time delay or
received signal strength between sensors) over regions of the network.
Furthermore, it is generally desirable to distribute the computational
burden across the network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor
communication.  We demonstrate that the information used for sensor
calibration is fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and
use this observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model
framework.  We then demonstrate the utility of \emph{nonparametric belief
propagation} (NBP), a recent generalization of particle filtering, for
both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties.
NBP has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed
fashion, admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent
multi-modal uncertainty.  We illustrate the performance of NBP on several
example networks while comparing to a previously published nonlinear least
squares method.

<p>The problem of approximating the product of several Gaussian mixture
distributions arises in a number of contexts, including the nonparametric
belief propagation (NBP) inference algorithm and the training of
product of experts models.
This paper develops two multiscale algorithms for sampling from a
product of Gaussian mixtures, and compares their performance to existing
methods.  The first is a multiscale variant of previously proposed
Monte Carlo techniques, with comparable
theoretical guarantees but improved empirical convergence rates.
The second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation
methods to construct a fast approximate sampler, which is
guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter $\epsilon$
of their true probability.
We compare both multiscale samplers on a set of computational examples
motivated by NBP, demonstrating significant improvements over existing
methods.

<p>In many applications of graphical models arising in computer vision, the hidden variables of interest
  are most naturally specified by continuous, non-Gaussian distributions. There exist inference algorithms
  for discrete approximations to these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional variables
  typically of interest, discrete inference becomes infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle 
  filters provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail to exploit the rich
  structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized 
  particle filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation
  (NBP) algorithm applicable to general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure
  to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous likelihoods. The algorithm can accomodate 
  an extremely broad class of potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP 
  extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can 
  describe. We apply the NBP algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face model,
  allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features.

<p>The issue of data association arises frequently in sensor
networks; whenever multiple sensors and sources are present, it
may be necessary to determine which observations from different
sensors correspond to the same target.  In highly uncertain
environments, one may need to determine this correspondence
without the benefit of an \emph{a priori} known joint
signal/sensor model.  This paper examines the data association
problem as the more general hypothesis test between factorizations
of a single, learned distribution.  The optimal test between known
distributions may be decomposed into model-dependent and
statistical dependence terms, quantifying the cost incurred by
model estimation from measurements compared to a test between
known models.  We demonstrate how one might evaluate a two-signal
association test efficiently using kernel density estimation
methods to model a wide class of possible distributions, and show
the resulting algorithm's ability to determine correspondence in
uncertain conditions through a series of synthetic examples. We
then describe an extension of this technique to multi-signal
association which can be used to determine correspondence while
avoiding the computationally prohibitive task of evaluating all
hypotheses. Empirical results of the approximate approach are
presented.

  the hidden variables of interest are most naturally specified by continuous,
  non-Gaussian distributions. However, due to the limitations of existing inference
  algorithms, it is often necessary to form coarse, discrete approximations to

  (NBP) algorithm, which uses stochastic methods to propagate kernel-based approximations
  to the true continuous messages. Each NBP message update is based on an efficient
  sampling procedure which can accomodate an extremely broad class of potential
  functions, allowing easy adaptation to new application areas. We validate our
  method using comparisons to continuous BP for Gaussian networks, and an application
  to the stereo vision problem.

<p>We present extensions to our previous work in modelling dynamical processes.
The approach uses an information theoretic criterion for searching over
subspaces of the past observations, combined with a nonparametric density
characterizing its relation to one-step-ahead prediction and uncertainty.
We use this methodology to model handwriting stroke data, specifically
signatures, as a dynamical system and show that it is possible to learn
a model capturing their dynamics for use either in synthesizing realistic
signatures and in discriminating between signatures and forgeries even
though no forgeries have been used in constructing the model.
This novel approach yields promising results even for small training sets.

<p>  We discuss an information theoretic approach for categorizing and
  modeling dynamic processes.  The approach can learn a compact and
  informative statistic which summarizes past states to predict future
  observations. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the prediction is
  characterized nonparametrically by a joint density over the learned
  statistic and present observation. We discuss the application of the
  technique to both noise driven dynamical systems and random
  processes sampled from a density which is conditioned on the
  past. In the first case we show results in which both the dynamics
  of random walk and the statistics of the driving noise are
  captured. In the second case we present results in which a
  summarizing statistic is learned on noisy random telegraph waves
  with differing dependencies on past states. In both cases the
  algorithm yields a principled approach for discriminating processes
  with differing dynamics and/or dependencies. The method is grounded
  in ideas from information theory and nonparametric statistics.
