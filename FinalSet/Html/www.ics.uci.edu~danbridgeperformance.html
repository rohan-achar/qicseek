<H2>program performance</H2>

The following table illustrates the program's performance on a Sparc 5.
<UL>
 <LI> The execution time dramatically increases
      with the problem size and difficulty.
      Many hands require only a few minutes, but
      some hands (two examples given below)
      require several hours, even using Version 4.
 <LI> If the pool usage approaches 100%, increasing POOLSIZ
      may significantly improve performance.
      In one example hand shown below, increasing POOLSIZ by 50%
      reduced the number of nodes (and time) by a factor of 2.
 <LI> The performance (execution time) will degrade horribly if too
      much space is used.  One should adjust STKSIZ and POOLSIZ so
      as to avoid using any virtual memory.  Since there are other
      resident programs (such as the underlying operating system),
      a reasonable rule of thumb is to use 75% of physical memory.
 <LI> When tree production is optionally suppressed,
      fewer nodes need to be expanded.
 <LI> Further significant performance enhancements are certainly
      possible,
      as comparison with Matt Ginsberg's engine (MG) illustrates.

In the above table,
<BR>
Nodes = number of nodes expanded (<tt>M</tt> = million, <tt>k</tt> = thousand)
<BR>
Time  = time to complete (in seconds, except <tt>m</tt> = minutes)
on a Sparc 5.
<BR>
A Pentium Pro 200 would be about 2.5 to 3 times faster.

The hands are as follows:
