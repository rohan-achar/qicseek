<H2> Make:&nbsp; a Unix programming aid </H2>

You should do separate compilation on files,
compiling code files (files ending with <tt>.c</tt>)
into object files (ending with <tt>.o</tt>), and then
creating a final executable version from these.&nbsp;
This saves much CPU
time since you only really need to recompile the files you have edited
since the last compile.&nbsp;
It also saves you precious hacking time since
you don't have to sit there waiting for your entire program to recompile
every time you make a few small corrections.&nbsp;
The Unix command <I>make</I> executes compiliation of large programs
according to a set of rules you give it.
<P>
The method (not the best -- just a general, simple way which handles
most cases reasonably well):
<P>
Your program for a given lab should be in a single directory.&nbsp;
Within the directory you should have
all of your code files (<tt>.c</tt>),
usually one include file (<tt>.h</tt>),
and a file called <tt>Makefile</tt> or <tt>makefile</tt>.&nbsp;
Later you will also have some object files (<tt>.o</tt>),
a single executable file, and perhaps some program input and output
files for testing purposes.
<P>
The code files contain all executable code and data declarations.&nbsp;
An easy rule is to put each function in a file by itself,
with the name of the file corresponding to the name of the function
contained therein.&nbsp;
There is nothing wrong with putting several (small) related functions
in each file as long as you can easily remember where you put them.
<P>
The <tt>.h</tt> file contains the compiler directives to insert all
system include files,
like <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>,
and all data type and macro definitions.&nbsp;
This file should <I>not</I>
contain anything that creates a variable, allocates space, or generates
executable code.&nbsp;
It <I>should</I> contain all compiler directives which
define data structures, macros, etc.&nbsp;
This file should be included at the head of all <tt>.c</tt> files.&nbsp;
Thus all code files will have exactly the same knowledge about
the environment in which they coexist.
<P>
The last file, <tt>Makefile</tt>, tells the system how all of your files
are inter-related, and how to combine them into a program.&nbsp;
<tt>Makefile</tt> consists of a list of files which need to be generated
in the process of creating an executable program.&nbsp;
This list will include the <tt>.o</tt> files and the final executable
file.&nbsp;
For each file, there is a list of files that the file depends on,
and a list of commands (usually just one <tt>gcc</tt> command) that will
generate the file.&nbsp;
The syntax is:&nbsp; on a given line you have the name of the file,
a colon, and a list of the files that it depends on,
separated by spaces.&nbsp;
On the next line, the first character <I>must</I> be a tab
(not eight spaces -- a <I>real</I> tab character).
Following the tab is a command that should result in the creation
of the desired file.&nbsp;
Blank lines between entries are allowed.&nbsp;
The following is an example <tt>Makefile</tt>:

#----------- example of a makefile ----------

CC=gcc

mysort: main.o timer.o insert.o quick.o merge.o heap.o
        $(CC) -o mysort main.o timer.o insert.o quick.o merge.o heap.o -lm

main.o: main.c my_includes.h
        $(CC) -c main.c

insert.o: insert.c my_includes.h
        $(CC) -c insert.c

quick.o: quick.c my_includes.h
        $(CC) -c quick.c

merge.o: merge.c my_includes.h
        $(CC) -c merge.c

heap.o: heap.c my_includes.h
        $(CC) -c heap.c

#----------- end of example makefile --------
</pre>
<P>
Notice that all files depend on a simple tree structure of
prerequisites.&nbsp;
The Unix command <tt>make</tt> will read <tt>Makefile</tt> and
examine the timestamps on the files involved.&nbsp;
It will then invoke only
the commands necessary to update branches of the tree that have been
modified since the last compile.
<P>
Also notice that <I>all</I> object files rely on the include file.&nbsp;
If you change a definition in the include file, you may redefine a data
structure or macro whose definition is known to all of the code files,
so they generally must all be recompiled.&nbsp;
But even though the include
file is listed as a prerequisite, it is not listed on the compile
command line since it is read in when the <tt>#include</tt> directive is
encountered on the first line of the <tt>.c</tt> file.&nbsp;
You should not need to
change the basic definitions in the <tt>.h</tt> file very often, since
you should not start coding until you have figured out what
global data structure definitions and other declarations you will need.
<P>
Note that include files that are located in the system include directory
are surrounded by angles (as in <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>) while include
files that are located in directories relative to the current
directory are surrounded by double quotes
(as in <tt>"my_includes.h"</tt>).
<P>
It has been observed that g++ will produce better diagnostics
than gcc if there are errors in your programs.&nbsp;
Other than that, if you write your
programs in standard ANSI C as described in Kernighan,
there should be no difference.
<P>
Here is another example makefile:
<P>
<pre>
# This sets a make variable OBJ to the list of all the files I want to
# compile together.  Make is smart enough to know that each file that
# ends in .o comes from a file that ends in .c.
OBJ = sorts.o insertion.o quick.o heap.o merge.o

# This tells make to use the g++ compiler instead of the default (cc)
# when it is implicitly producing .o files from .c files.
CC = g++

# This tells make what flags to use when compiling C programs.  The flag
# -Wall tells g++ to print all warning messages.  The flag -g tells
# g++ to generate the extra information required by a symbolic debugger
# such as gdb.
CFLAGS = -Wall -g 

# This tells make that the main program it is to build
# is "sorts" and that sorts depends on the files listed in the make variable
# OBJ.  It also gives a command on the second line to compiler the
# final executable file "sorts".  Note that the second line begins
# with a TAB.  Make is very fussy that command lines begin with TABs.
sorts : $(OBJ)
	g++ $(CFLAGS) -o sorts $(OBJ) /home/dan/165/timer.o
