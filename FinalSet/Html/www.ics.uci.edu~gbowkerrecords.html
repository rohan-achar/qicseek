AL RECORD:</b><p><b>Towards a Sociology of an Artifact</b><p><p><p>This paper argues that the medical record is an important focus forsociological research. In medical work, the modern patient's body Foucault hasso aptly described is produced throug


h embodied, materially heterogeneous work- and the medical record plays a crucial role in this production. It does notsimply represent this body's history and geography: it is a central element inthe material re-writing of these. Simultaneously, the re


cord fulfills a corerole in the production of a <i>body politic</i>. As the record is involved inthe performance of the patient's body, it is also involved in the performanceof the <i>clinic</i> in which that body comes to life. Finally, we argue that<


i>different</i> records, different practices of reading and writing areintertwined with the production of different patient's bodies, bodies politic,and bodies of knowledge. As organizational infrastructure, the medical recordaffords the interplay and 


coordination of divergent worlds. Seen in this light,as a site where multiple stories about patients and about organizations are atstake (including the interoperability between these stories), the medicalrecord becomes highly relevant both analytically


 and politically. <p><p><p><p>	In his <i>Birth of the Clinic</i>, Foucault argues that the classical,pre-modern "medicine of species" required a two-dimensional table as anintermediary between the individual body and medical knowledge (1973/1963). T


hetable would translate individual symptoms: it would yield the true nature ofthe disease by showing how they fitted into the eternal scheme of things.Symptoms were not the disease itself: they were pointers to this higher truth,which merely "precipit


ated" in individual bodies, and which the table coulddecode. In contrast to the medicine of species, Foucault argues, the modernclinical gaze requires no such intermediary. Truth is no longer found andorganized elsewhere in some grand nosological schem


e, but rather in thepathological processes of individual bodies. The gaze deciphers this truth byfollowing the symptoms inwards, eliciting signs, and differentiating thepathological reality that now <i>is</i> the disease.<p>	Yet the development of thi


s gaze depended crucially on the development of somenew intermediaries. <i>Writing </i>was crucial in this new configuration."Medicine no longer tried to see the essential truth beneath the sensibleindividuality; it was faced by the task of perceiving,


 and to infinity, theevents of an open domain" (Foucault 1973, p. 98). In order to develop a body oftrue knowledge, medicine had to record individual cases: only in theaccumulation of such experience, only in the totality of observers/observationscoul


d true knowledge be generated (Fagot-Largeault, 1989; Dagognet 1970). Acascade of inscriptions, to use Latour's term, typified and produced thepossibility of this means of knowing (Latour 1987; 1993, pp. 171-225).<p>	Although Foucault does not discuss 


this in the <i>Birth of the Clinic</i>,knowing <i>in the practice of medicine</i> is similarly dependent on writing.The power of the gaze, in other words, would not go very far if it stoodisolated (<i>cf</i>. Atkinson 1995, pp. 60-65). No longer typifi


ed by themetaphorical two-dimensional table Foucault describes, modern medicine couldnot be imagined without that other object of consultation: the medical record.In this paper, we argue that the medical record is fundamental to the everydayproduction


 of that contemporary body whose archeology Foucault describes (abody which hides the essences of the disease in the pathological processestaking place in its tissues; where the symptoms and signs attest to a realitywhich is never completely accessible


 in life) and to the everyday production ofthe organizations which enact and treat it. <p>	How is the patient's body produced in hospital wards? How is its specificgeometry and its historicity created? How is the patient's body transformedfrom the liv


ed body of Mr. Thompson into a juxtaposition of organs, parameters,rows of numbers, graphs, and so forth? Is this through a specific way of<i>looking</i>? Or is this a discursive transformation, achieved through<i>talk </i>(as is a frequent focus of so


cial constructivist medicalsociology)?<a href="record_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>(see e.g. Davis 1986; ten Have1994) We will maintain that the body is produced through embodied, materiallyheterogeneous work (Hirschauer 1991; Cussins 1996). Much comes into pla


y here:urine containers, infusion pumps, nursing routines, doctor's consultations, andso forth. All these artifacts, individuals and organizational routines areintermediaries which together perform the medical body. Following recentdevelopments in sci


ence and technology studies (Bijker and Law 1992; Clarke andFujimura 1992; Latour 1996; Star 1995), we argue that they constitute thenetwork, or the <i>dispositif </i>within which the body acquires its specificontology. We focus on the medical record b


ecause this artifact occupies acentral niche in this network: it is where many of the nurses and physician'stasks begin, end, and are coordinated, where inscriptions accumulate, and wherethe specific spaces and times we will describe unfold. The record


 does notmerely mirror the bodies it maps, we argue - but neither does it determinethem. To emphasize the active role of artifacts without falling intotechnological determinism, we use the term "mediation" (Latour 1994): therecord <i>mediates</i> the 


relations that it organizes, the bodies that areconfigured through it.<p>	Following Foucault, we stress that these practices of reading and writing arenot only central to the production of a patient's body: they also fulfill acore role in the producti


on of a <i>body politic</i>. As the record is involvedin the performance of the patient's body Foucault so aptly describes, it isalso involved in the performance of the <i>clinic</i> in which that body comesto life. A specific configuration of the body


 cannot be cut loose from thespecific social position different health professionals have within hospitals,and with the type of stories about the work done that can emerge from therecords. To strengthen both these points, we make a third argument which


departs from the Foucauldian scheme.<a href="record_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a> Weargue that <i>different</i> records, different practices of reading and writingare intertwined with the production of <i>different</i> patient's bodies,different bodies politic


, and different bodies of knowledge. <p>	In the first section, we look in some detail at a medical record taken from anoncology ward from a Dutch University Hospital. Here we concentrate on theproduction of patient's bodies. In the second section, we c


oncentrate on theway in which the medical record shapes various bodies politic. We explore somemore general developments in the area of medical record keeping such as theincreasing attention to coding and classification, and the attempts to producean 


electronic medical record. In each section we look first at the generalprocess of production of the body/the body politic and then look at thepractice of multiplicity (managing the articulation of multiple bodies/bodiespolitic).<p>	Throughout, we will


 be using a broad definition of the medical "record" as allwritten, typed or electronically stored traces of any aspect of patienttreatment that has official status within the hospital system and is inprinciple stored for a period of time (at least equ


al to the patient's stay inthe hospital; see e.g. Huffman 1990). More often than not, this implies thatthe "medical record" is not one single object: rather, it is the record thephysicians keep in one folder at the outpatient clinic together with the (


alsooften physically separate) nursing and physician's "in house" record, with theseparate forms created and used in the hospital administration offices - and soforth.<p>	This paper is not primarily concerned with practices of reading and writingwhic


h bring the record to life (see Berg 1996 for this approach); it isconcerned, rather, with mapping the configurations it helps bring into being.We will thus not be looking at the real-time articulation work that links therecord to the ongoing work, or 


at the informal organizations thatinterpenetrate the more formal body politics. These are crucial issues (seee.g. Suchman 1987; Star 1995), but we want to explore here how the structuringof the record speaks to the structuring of the bodies we investig


ate. It is asynchronic exercise to explore just how a mundane, boring artifact like amedical record is involved in the politically charged production of humanbodies, organizational hierarchies, and selective memories.<p>	The paper is based on two line


s of research. Marc Berg has spent severalmonths in different wards in various hospitals in the Netherlands, focusing onthe role of artifacts such as records and protocols in the ongoing processes ofmedical work (see e.g. Berg 1997). Geoffrey Bowker ha


s studied the history ofmedical records and has through a series of interviews and observations tracedthe development of a nursing classification scheme designed for incorporationwithin hospital information systems.<p><p><p><p><p><b>PRODUCING BODI


ES</b><p><b></b><p><b></b>	Mr. Wood is a patient on the Dutch University Hospital oncology ward.Imagine a newly arrived oncologist, who begins her shift on this ward. Shemeets Mr. Wood without having his medical record to hand. She sees a middleaged,


 somber looking man, probably suffering from cancer since this is theoncology ward. Questioning him or the personnel on the ward, she may elicit astory of Hodgkin's disease, which has been treated once before, but which hasrecurred. Investigating him m


ight yield some more clues as to the spread of thedisease, the side effects of his treatment, his general condition. Without therecord, she might sense the damage the cancer has done, and conclude that theprognosis is poor. Yet she would excuse herself


 and not take any action beforehaving seen the record. Without the record, she is without memory, without adevice to structure her thought; despite all her years of experience, she isbarely more able to proceed than the recently graduated resident who 


standsbesides her.<a href="record_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a><p>	With the record, things are different. This record comprises some 120 pages,producing a fascinating, detailed yet jagged and dispersed memory of thepatient. It starts with the temperature list 


(Figure 1): an unfolding sheetwhich is structured like a flow-chart, wherein blood pressure, pulse,temperature, medications and so forth are logged. Next is the order form, onwhich physicians write down any diagnostic steps and changes in treatment for


nursing staff to effectuate. Then come the physician's progress notes, startingwith a few pre-structured forms which summarize the patient's medical historyat the date of admission, and followed by over twenty, unstructured pages ofdaily notes. These 


are followed by computer print outs from the laboratoryinformation system (listing rows of numbers indicating outcomes of laboratorytests performed on the patient's blood and urine), results from bacteriologicaltests and X-rays (altogether over twenty 


pages), letters written about Mr.Wood, and so forth.<p><p>FIGURE 1 HERE<p><p><p><i>History</i><p><i></i><p>	The record produces a patient with a medical <i>history: </i>the accumulationof sets of traces configures a medical past for a specific pa


tient.<ahref="record_fn.html#fn0">[4]</a> The temperature list maps the differentparameters against time - the <i>x</i>-axis of this flow chart. Lines dividethe sheet into weeks and days, and thinner lines divide the upper, graphicalpart of the sheet 


even further into eight-hour periods. Temperature, pulse andrespiration rate can be entered along the <i>y</i>-axis. Below this, the<i>y</i>-axis changes its role. It becomes a list of different parameters:tension, weight, specific gravity of the urine


, bleeding time (both not filledin on this form), and the medication given. Presenting them in this wayclarifies how changes in one are temporally related to changes in another - yettheir vertical order is arbitrary. Further below, the <i>y</i>-axis ch


angesagain: here it incorporates a mathematical operation. The different infusionslisted add up to total fluid intake ("totale vochtopname"), followed by thedifferent varieties of fluid loss that result in total fluid loss. These totalsare then subtra


cted, resulting in the last row on this sheet: the fluidbalance.<p>	The forms listing the laboratory results are structured in a similar fashion:columns of figures, each column indicating a time at which the blood wastested. Reading such forms from le


ft to right, one enters the past in a mostorderly fashion: step by step, day by day, or even hour by hour, the samevariable is followed back through time. This produces a linear, stable history;this activity <i>performs </i>the temporality that Foucaul


t saw as a crucialinnovation of the modern, clinical gaze. It generates a body with a set ofvariables whose mutual interrelations and deviations can be traced. The bodyacquires a double continuity: it acquires a past through recurring variablesdistrib


uted throughout an evenly flowing time, and this past <i>itself</i>remains constant over time. Whether a doctor looks at these traces one day orone month later, this past does not change. (As we will see later, thisconstancy is not characteristic of al


l the histories produced in the record,nor does it imply a unified history).<p>	History is also produced by putting new forms (such as X-ray reports) in frontof the previous form in that section. This does not produce the graphicaloversight that a flo


w sheet format provides, but through for example flippingthrough the bacteriology reports, the doctor again finds herself traveling backand forth through linear time, accelerating and decelerating where necessary.Through compressing several weeks of re


ports into a few seconds, the doctorleaves the time zones of everyday medical work and enters the temporal order ofpathological processes of Foucault's body: the record produces <i>textbook</i>time. The growth of a tumor as witnessed on successive X-ra


ys, the battlebetween microorganisms and antibiotic regimes, and the rise and fall of bloodcells as the chemotherapy does its work - these are not events which take placewithin the time zones of a working day. Fluctuations in blood cell levels onlybec


ome meaningful over a several day period, and the "growth of a tumor"unfolds over several weeks. Since the rows of blood cell levels on one pagecover some ten days, and the X-ray reports over a two month period usually onlycover a few pages, the record


 elegantly affords this crossing between timezones.<a href="record_fn.html#fn0">[5]</a><p>	The physician's progress notes and letters, finally, generate a history in asomewhat different way. As the pages of the progress notes fill up, thesequence of e


ntries can certainly be read much as the sequence of bacteriologyreports or laboratory tests: re-winding time backwards to generate an image ofevents taking place in a different temporal order. Yet most entries themselvesstart out with a short "summary


" of the case, as follows:<p><p>	Now 8 days post-reinfusion			<i>(of his bone marrow cells)</i><ahref="record_fn.html#fn0">[6]</a><p>	Last night started 	amica 2 x 700		<i>(these are antibiotics)</i><p>				ripera 4 x 4 gr.<p>	Origin?						<i>(... of


 the fever)</i><p>	<i>(From Mr. Wood's record)</i><p>In these summaries, the "current situation" is deduced from other entries inthe record, the new laboratory results, information from nurses and thepatient, and so forth. The starting point of that d


ay's deliberations isformulated in a single phrase uninterpretable out of the context of the otherentries. These summaries are read, re-read, re-written in the light of newevents, summarized again, and continually constitute a brief patient's historya


s relevant at that particular juncture (Berg 1996). Glancing through a fewrecent pages of progress notes, then, is often the preferred way for a novelphysician to "eyeball" a patient's current situation: to build a multi-layeredhistory of pathological 


processes, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures,intertwined with organizational routines (such as who was the responsiblephysician when, where was the patient sent to), and so forth.<p><p><p><i>Geography</i><p><p>	The record also produces an anato


mical <i>geography</i>. Its differentsections detach the blood from its vessels, split its constituents, juxtaposethe organs. The case history form separates several "organ systems", as do thenursing history forms; the X-ray reports delineate the "thor


ax", the "abdomen",and all the structures that can be seen within these bodily cavities.Orthogonal to the creation of a linear history, here anatomical orders areproduced which perform the textbook medical body. The record thus also performsa dislocat


ion in <i>space</i> (Latour 1987): it performs an in-vivo dissection,fleshing out a map to the terrain that is hidden under the patient's skin. Thismap affords a linkage of anatomical realities analogous to the time traveldescribed above. Juxtaposing t


he radiographic reports from Mr. Wood with thephysical examination and the laboratory results allows the physician to tracethe spread of the cancer and to weigh the damage done by the chemotherapy.<p>	But what does it mean, exactly, to say that the rec


ord "produces" a patient'shistory or geography? Of course, Mr. Wood's record is productive of narrativein the banal sense that people tend to read a narrative structure into any setof facts and figures: Boland (1993) has shown how, read by accountants,


 twodifferent sets of balances sheets can give rise to the most varied conjecturesabout the personal lives and professional competence of their peers. Yet wewant to go further. We are <i>not</i> arguing that the record produces ahistory or geography b


y creating a specific representation of the body, whileleaving the "real" patient's body untouched. It is not a matter of merelyproducing a particular discourse, a specific rhetoric about a body. The medicalrecord is not simply a post hoc depiction of 


times passed and spaces explored:it feeds into the very constitution of these times and spaces. The medicalrecord is a <i>distributing and collecting device</i> (Berg 1996): work tasksbegin and end there. It produces the patient's history by sequential


lydemanding that the same measurements be made again and again (according to thedensity of the <i>x</i>-axis). In order to produce the evenly distributedgraphs and tables, these measurements have to be meticulously timed: every day,standard blood test


s are performed, bacteriological cultures are taken; andevery eight hours, nurses measure the temperature and the pulse. Every day,physicians produce a new summary of the situation which forms the basis forthat day's diagnostic and therapeutic interven


tions. The end result is not a"medical" history which is clearly distinguishable from the history of Mr.Wood. The production of this representation can only occur with the concurrenttransformation of that which is represented. The meticulous organizati


onalroutines into which the patient is "hooked" totally transform and control thepatient's previous time zones - determining when the patient sleeps,structuring the days, and transforming the very experience of the flow of time(Frankenberg 1992; Roth 


1979/1963; Star and Bowker 1994). The body is thusre-written in bureaucratic format: the weekly, daily and eight-hour cycleswhich now structure the patient's time closely match the doctor's and nurses'shifts, the opening and closing hours of the labora


tory, and the measurementunits of the financial administration (Zerubavel 1979). Again, this is notmerely a different, professional "reading" of the body. The body is materiallyreconfigured - its flesh is part and parcel of the discursive transformatio


nswe witness here. In Star and Bowker's terms, we witness a <i>convergence</i>between body and representation: in its production, the representationinscribes itself in the body it represents (1994).<p>	It is this re-written body, subsequently, which i


s the site of the diagnosticand therapeutic interventions. At this point, it becomes meaningless to debatewhether these interventions address the body "itself" or its representation,since it is <i>in and through</i> this representation that the body "i


tself" isknown, surveyed and intervened upon. Peaks in the temperature curve will promptthe administration of a certain antibiotic - whose effect subsequently is alsomonitored in that graph, and in the temporal changes in the laboratory valuesregister


ing the organ functions that might be affected by this drug. Not onlydo the record's pre-formatted time zones inscribe itself into the patient'sbody: all medical activities are started, followed up and evaluated within thetime zones produced by the rec


ord. Most of the relevant historical events inthe hospitalized patient's life become events triggered by orders written inthe record - procedures set in motion by specific forms; therapeutic dosagesre-adjusted because of an increase in a certain labora


tory variable - asgleaned from the record.<p>	While the patient's time is morphed into the record's time, the patient'sgeography is rewritten as well. As Hirschauer has so beautifully argued, thesurgeon who operates on a body meticulously prepares and


 carves out the tissues<i>so that they map the anatomical atlas</i>. The atlas does not simply figureas the "ground" of objective knowledge, immediately visible in individualpatient's bodies. Rather, this visibility is the outcome of the surgeon's"scu


lptured practice": "the proper anatomy of the ideal body is engraved ...into the patient-body" (1991). In an analogous fashion, the record inscribes ageography. The forms physicians and nurses use in their investigations of thepatient body invariably d


elineate the organ systems. A form used in anintensive care unit, for example, listed the categories under "physicalexamination" as follows:<p><p>general impression<p>central nervous system<p>cardial<p>pulmonal<p>abdomen<p>urogenital<p>extremiti


es<p><p>Similarly, many laboratory tests are categorized anatomically: "liverfunction", "renal function", "pulmonary function". In this way, throughcategorizing observations and substances from the body, the record carves outan anatomy. And it is thi


s "geographicalized" body which is subsequentlyintervened upon: drug dosages are adjusted to correct a decreasing liverfunction, antibiotics are geared towards a possible focus for infection seen onan X-ray, and tubes and monitor cables are put in plac


e to monitor thecardio-vascular circulation. As above, in an ever tightening cycle, thepatient's body <i>becomes</i> its representation. Information required by therecord or written in the record leads to interventions on the patient's body asit is re


presented in the record. Again, the record does not simply describe apatient's body: it structures the way the patient's body is rewritten. Thecategorization of observations and substances is only a first step in acontinuing sequence of events, in whic


h the individual anatomical systemsbecome the center for specific interventions by different specialists. Fluidsand medication are given to correct urogenital problems, a chest is puncturedto restore a deflated lung to its proper form, and postures hav


e to be taken toshoot the X-ray right: in mapping the patient, the patient's body isreconfigured so that it <i>matches its map</i>. <p>	The record is of course not the only element active in these rewritingprocesses. Only as a part of a interlocked se


ries of elements does the recordcome to life; only when linked to nursing and laboratory routines, tubes,infusion bags and cables, the hospital information system and so forth does anetwork emerge which <i>as a whole</i> performs the transformations de


scribed.And the record's structure does not "determine" the nursing routines in anysimple way: these routines and the record's current structure have emergedtogether, mirroring one another and interlocking in historically specific ways(Berg forthcomin


g). Yet the record is one turning point in the cycle ofinscriptions that circulate through these interlinked entities. It is where theinscriptions end up, are matched and rearranged, and where newinscription-yielding activities begin.<p><p><p><i>Mul


tiplicity</i><p><p>	The rewriting processes described above do not produce a single coherent andtransparent patient's body, mapped into Euclidean space. Medical practice isnot a unitary apparatus "disciplining" the patient's body into somefree-floati


ng, similarly unitary biomedical entity (Haraway 1991; Hirschauerand Mol 1995). Focusing again on the medical record, we could say that itconstitutes <i>multiple</i> histories. It encompasses multiple layers: timeflows faster in some sections than in o


thers. The temperature curve exists intime measured in hours, while X-ray's exist in time measured in days. Somepages capture a time span of two months, while other pages cannot hold even asingle day.<p>	And these histories do not simply fold into one


 another. The flow chart linksseveral histories by mapping them on a similar <i>x</i>-axis - yet even herethe histories remain relatively self-contained. The fluid balance, for example,is produced as a closed system, with a rhythm and an internal logic


 which istransparent. Daily, a single number results which "represents" the fluidbalance of this particular patient. And the temperature curve is similarlyclear-cut: it is a graph mapping the evolution of the patient's bodytemperature over eight-hour 


periods. Yet the interrelation between these twohistories is not self-evident. The only direct linkage (Mol forthcoming)produced by the record is a temporal co-occurence. But how are the peaksrelated to the numbers? Are they? What is their joint histor


y?<p>	Such links are sometimes made in other parts of the record: especially inprogress notes. A high temperature reading may be linked to a negative fluidbalance record by the story that the former causes dehydration. Yet theprogress notes only refer


 to a fraction of all the data listed in the record.More often than not, the X-ray reports, temperature curve, fluid balance,laboratory values and so forth remain unconnected, in their own time zones. Andeven <i>if </i>they are connected through the pr


ogress notes, anothercomplication of the image of a fully integrated,
unitary, Euclidean bodyarises. Where the flow chart and the series of
X-ray reports produce a seriesof - often separate - linear histories, the
progress notes contain non-linear</


i> histories. The summaries extract and condense time to matchthe current situation. Moreover, they continually reconstruct these historieswhenever the current situation is changed. The progress notes do not build uplinear histories like a flow chart d


oes. Rather, a history of the patientevolves <i>in</i> the progress notes, changing whenever the current situationchanges. Links are forged to the linear histories evolving elsewhere in therecord, but these links are constantly reconstructed, removed a


nd retrofittedwhenever the current situation alters. What is a crucial temperature peak attime <i>t</i>, may become a singular, non-relevant reading later, and beforgotten in the next summary. And what is described as a sequenced chain ofevents at som


e stage in the progress notes, gets summarized into a singular"event" later on. At the eighth day after the reinfusion of Wood's bone marrowcells, the summary in the progress notes starts out with "now 8 dayspost-reinfusion", and then states "last nigh


t started amica &amp; ripera" (seethe fragment of his record above). A whole evening of doctor's deliberations onthe right antibiotics to prescribe is summarized in this last sentence. And theeight days between reinfusion and last night flash by uneven


tfully, only toslow down "last night", and to stop in the present, where the search for the"origin" of the fever is the order of the day. Time loops and swirls in thesereconstructions: post hoc rationalizations after a sequence of dispersedoccurrences


 become prior reasons for a "decision", and episodes get condensed,stretched and rearranged. Although the progress notes do sometimes tie thehistories evolving in different sections of the record together, they produce ahistory which is non-linear, con


stantly rewritten, and constantly emergent.<p>	There is, then, no simple mapping between these histories. Mr. Wood's recordportrays an array of histories, which do not fold into one another to produceone overall history of a medical body. Rather, the d


ifferent historiesco-exist, self-contained, sometimes touching and interlinked, but often goingtheir own way. The record performs <i>multiple</i> histories: a series ofparallel trajectories, through parallel but also often disconnected time-zones,and 


a series of statements in which a integrative, historical narrativeconstantly rewrites itself.<p>	The multiplicity of the patient performed by the medical record is prominentwhen we look at the patient's geography. Juxtaposing the different parts of th


erecord does not provide an evenly distributed, three dimensional map of thebody. The travel through bodily space is discontinuous, and filled withindeterminacy. The different sections all stand for a series of probes (theblood tests, the radiographic


 procedures, the physical examination) that arelet down into body that, in Foucault's felicitous phrase, hides its innerpathological truth as long as it remains in the "night of life" (1973, p. 165).Different sections perform different geographies: som


e organ systems are lumpedtogether in one, and separated in other parts. The blood test formsmeticulously separate different cell types, which are lumped together in thefluid loss forms (all under the category "blood"). The bacteriological formsdistin


guish different sites from which cultures are taken: the urine, theblood, the throat, the prepuce, the feces. The X-ray reports speak about thethorax (including the lungs, the heart) and the abdomen (including liver,spleen, pancreas, and so forth). And


 sometimes different geographies areperformed on one form: the "organ systems" listed on the intensive care'sphysical examination form (see above), for instance, mapped out regions (theabdomen, the extremities), functional systems (cardial, pulmonal, c


entralnervous system) as well as an overall "others" category (generalimpressions).<p>	Here as well, the different geographies do not unequivocally fold into onebiomedical body. There are spaces that remain empty, and there are spaces thatare filled 


with competing tales. A differentiation in "regions" cross-sects adifferentiation in "fluids" (blood, urine), which cross-cuts a differentiationin "functional systems"; some "functional systems" might be grouped in one"region", while others (e.g. the c


ardio-vascular system, or the nervous system)might not. How are these related? How is what is seen on the X-thorax relatedto the "cardial system" as felt and heard during the physical examination? Doesfluid loss through blood loss result in a loss of e


quivalent amounts of thedifferent blood cell types, or does bleeding result in a depletion of somecells more than others? As above, these links are not self-evident. They may becreated, in the record, through an explicit juxtaposition and interpretatio


n ofthese observations in the progress notes, or through additional examinations (amore frequently repeated series of blood tests, for example). The point is thatthese links are often not made; that they are absent, thus leaving thegeographies in thei


r unconnected realms (Mol forthcoming). And when suchattempts are made, the geographies may well contradict each other. The bloodmight seem infected according to the changing ratio in blood cell types, butnot according to the bacterial examination of t


he blood; while the physicalexamination may carve out lungs that are "clean", an X-ray may simultaneouslyshow lungs that are "massively infiltrated". Again, the record does not containmechanisms for preventing such gaps and conflicts. It performs multi


plegeographies, sometimes linked, sometimes oblivious to one another, sometimesconflicting.<p><b></b><p><b></b><p><b>MULTIPLE BODIES POLITIC</b><p><b></b><p><b></b>	The record is not only crucial for the planning of interventions andthe coordinati


on and interaction between care providers. Other parties are alsohighly interested in the record. Insurance companies want more informationabout the indications for interventions, researchers want data on theprevalence of combinations of symptoms and t


he efficacy of therapies, andgovernments and hospital boards want to know how many days patients of aspecific diagnostic category are hospitalized - and for what reasons. All theseparties claim that the patient record can deliver the information they r


equire(see e.g.<i> </i>Ball and Collen 1992). In these discussions, the record isoften portrayed as a "repository of information" (Dick and Steen 1991), as avast treasure of facts which only needs to be tapped into. In such a view, thebuilding blocks,


 the "facts", can only be more or less "adequate" and"complete".<p>	One dream of an electronic medical record from the 1970s was that such arecord would provide an unmediated picture of doctors' thought, and produce anuntainted, complete, error-free d


ocument: <p><p>To put a secretary or a computer technician between the physician and thecomputer is defeating the purpose of a direct natural languagephysician-computer conversation. If a girl has to interpret what you have saidand then put this in s


ome form that she thinks the computer will understand, Ithink we increase the error rate. More important, you prevent the physicianfrom <i>talking</i> to the computer. When the technology becomes sophisticatedenough and the expense becomes low enough t


hat the physician-computer interfaceshould be direct and in a natural language, there should be no girl, no marksense card, no keyboard or any other type of artificial instrument between himand his computer. This is why a light pen was devised. It look


s like a pencil,it has the physical form of a pencil. The physician has been using the sameinstrument since he was three years old. (Anderson and Forsythe, 1970, p. 257)<p><p>Current, "paper" medical records are harshly criticized precisely for notp


roperly reflecting what has happened, and what physicians think: <p><p>The medical record is an abomination. ... It is a disgrace to the professionthat created it. More often than not, the chart is thick, tattered,disorganized, and illegible; progress


 notes, consultant's notes, radiologyreports, and nurses notes are all co-mingled in accession sequence. The chartsconfuse rather than enlighten; they provide a forbidding challenge to anyonewho tries to understand what is happening to a patient (Bleic


h 1993).<p><p>	The dream of the unmediated record dates from the earliest medical computingapplications such as MUMPS (Barnett, 1975)<i> - </i>and has of course neverbeen realized. There are many steps between "what happened" and the finalrecord of t


hese events: the summarizing processes described, but also the ofteninvisible but crucial pool of typists who transform the physicians' tapedreports into legible, grammatically correct and understandable reports. Andmost medical records work in hospita


ls is actually done by the equallyinvisible yet crucial medical records professionals - there are some fiftyschools in the States training people for bachelor's degrees in Medical RecordsAdministration (Huffman 1990, p. 53). Such professionals signific


antly changeaspects of the record. For example, Ann Fagot-Largeault (1989, pp. 139-140)traces the mediation process for French death certificates. She cites caseswhere, like doctors, coders (who take the medical history and apply it to thedeath certif


icate) have their own favorite codes - leading to an "epidemic" of"diffuse intravascular coagulation" in the 1970s (p. 145). These mediations addup: she cites a study from 1970 in Stockholm, where it was shown that the finalcause of death was wrong (as


 demonstrated by autopsy; itself of course aspecific mediation) in 45% of cases for "probable" causes of death and in 25%of "certain" causes... (p. 145). It is estimated in France that about one infour certificates filled in by doctors need to be "re-i


nterpreted"; withdoctors agreeing with the coder's choice only between 
80% and 95% of the time(p. 218).<a href="record_fn.html#fn0">7</a>	The 
image of the record as a more or less adequate representation of facts andevents is also problematic since, a


s we have seen, the record feeds into thevery constitution of these facts and events. We have seen how the recordcontains many emergent stories about the patient's body: both its temporalityand geography. Any one implementation of the record actualizes


 one type ofstory; and a set of implementations employing a standardized story format (itis easier to tell some stories than others in the record) inscribes itsspecific time and space in the patient's body. In this section, we shall seethat the same a


nalysis can be made of the organizational work done by themedical record.<p>What do medical records record? The record traces what Strauss and hisco-workers have called the "illness trajectory": the course of the illness, thetotal organization of work


 done over that period and the impact of that work onthose involved (1985, p. 8). In this section, we will take one cut through thistotality, arguing that medical records always describe past action in thecontext of a set of organizational arrangements


. It would be meaningless tocite a temperature reading from a record out of the context of what thatreading entailed organizationally - a high reading in this kind of chart atthis point entrains this kind of response, and so forth. The medical record o


fits nature only exists within a certain organizational context: as do allrecords of past action. But it at the same time feeds into the reproduction ofthese organizational contexts: the act of recording both enacts theorganization that deals with the


 phenomenon and creates the past within whichthe phenomenon has occurred. Medical records produce a series of well-definednarrative structures; each of which reflects and produces a particular kind ofsocial organization. We want to look at some of thes


e structures to elaboratehow the record is involved in the reflection and production of different bodypolitics; how the records are involved in the very production of thedescriptions under which they function.8 Here as well as above, the crucialobserv


ation is that the stories the record produces are not mere<i>representations</i> of the work - they are a core, constituent<i>part</i> of it.<i> </i>We will concentrate on three dimensions of theorganizational life of medicine in turn: institution


al (legal and insurancearrangements), work practice (the organization of the clinic) and processes ofprofessionalization (nursing); at each point we shall be concerned with thedeployment of medical records in building a "body politic".<ahref="record_f


n.html#fn0">[9]</a> Finally, we will - making the same move as inthe previous section - discuss the question of multiplicity: how oneinfrastructural form (the medical record) can produce a range of configurationsof these bodies politic.<i></i><p><i></


i><p><i></i><p><i>The body of the law</i></i><p>	The medical record is 
one of 
the records that produces the legal entity thecitizen-in-the-state (Ewald 1986). In order for the record to work, the objectof the story has to be a registered entity (the 


need for registration oftenbeing the need for medical attention). Here as elsewhere the primary issue isnot whether the records tells a "true" story; though in this case the act ofregistering in a sense makes it so - it is constitutive of citizenship.H


utchins (1995) reminds us of this in the case of navigation: the primarymotive for the rich set of records kept by every ship is that the captain needsto be able to show, in case of accident, that everything possible was done.<ahref="record_fn.html#fn0


">[10]</a> And in a textbook on medical records, thefirst thing that is said about medical data entry is that these "formulate alegal document that demonstrates the following:<p>*	the patient has a need for service<p>*	the correct service is provided<


p>*	the service is provided in the proper manner by the proper person". (Watersand Murphy 1979, p. 54).<p>In current medical work, this legal story is simultaneously the story producedfor the insurance companies' interest: it legitimates the actions p


erformed aswell as their costs. These are particular kind of stories: the legal recordshould not contain inconsistencies or lacunae (Bowker 1994). It should notrefer to things which "just happened". Everything has to be explicable andjustifiable. If t


he patient died it was despite the full operation of dueprocess; if a test was performed it was because there was a clear-cut medicalindication. The <i>outcome</i> of the legal record (the moral of the story) isthe meta-affirmation that the medical sys


tem is fully penetrated andunderwritten by the legal system: that the doctors did everything that theycould be expected to, and that all these affirmations were just. <p>	Typically, these "preferred" accounts centralize the physician's agency ascore d


ecision maker, and reduce the role of the nurse to the provision ofprimary data and the execution of the doctor's plans. Although nurses spend farmore time with the patient, their presence in the medical record is limited tofilling in the temperature l


ist; whilst the final story emphasizes the logicalwork (rational reconstruction) of physicians, who are geographically much moreremoved from the patient. The story that is told over and over again is thatpatients are cured by doctors' actions; and that


 doctors' actions reflect arational thought process. In producing these stories about doctors as heroesand patients as objects, the record configures chains of delegation that renderthe doctor the representative of the entire heterogeneous assembly com


prisingthe hospital. S/he is performed as the head of the organizational workcomprising the crafting of the patient's body, which is done according to thelogic of textbook science. This "repository of information", in other words,embodies a differenti


al evaluation of whose time counts, whose informationmatters, and whose work deserves to be mentioned and made visible (Egger andWagner 1993; Frankenberg 1992; Star 1991).<ahref="record_fn.html#fn0">[11]</a><p>	How do these preferred accounts evolve? 


It would be wrong to assume thatmedical personnel "lie", or that there are "cover ups" going on somewhere.Preferred accounts emerge from the record only gradually, through small stepsand reconstructions which by themselves are just ordinary moments in 


theongoing work. The ordering and polishing of accounts is a natural process - itis a <i>prerequisite</i> for the smooth progression of complex, interactivework processes (Garfinkel 1967).<p>	One of the active elements in the production of such accoun


ts is the medicalrecord (Berg 1996). The records lead to a rational reconstruction of the past -just the same kind of rational reconstruction that has been so successfullydeconstructed within science studies (see for example Latour and Woolgar 1986).T


he record is instrumental in producing such stories that tell "rational","textbook" narratives about a patient entering a hospital with complaint X,being diagnosed with Y, treated with Z, and who was discharged with or diedfrom Q. Its very forms are st


ructured towards such a sequence: the complaintshould be filled in first, then the diagnosis, and then the therapy. The formssuggest the reasoning process which <i>should</i> have taken place: theconclusions are logically derived from the data gathered


 (Barrett 1988).<p>	In addition, the record is the very place where a public account of "what hashappened" is created. It is when writing into this potential source forretrospective inspection that physicians and nurses construe narratives thatalign w


hat actually happened with what should have happened - no matter howinsignificant these occurrences may seem (Garfinkel 1967, pp. 197-207; Hunter1991). If a patient has been hospitalized for several days, for example, nursesmay omit measuring the blood


 pressure and just fill in yesterday's measurementin today's column (see Figure 1). Likewise, residents often ask nurses what toprescribe while they complete the order form in the regular fashion: as if itis they who have told the nurses what to do (<i


>cf.</i> Hughes 1988). The samephenomenon occurs in and through the summaries that are continually beingproduced. In this process, details are omitted, and the story is simplified andretold in ways that fit the present situation at hand. This results i


n anincreasing stylization of past events into a standard cannon: a sign leading toa diagnosis leading to a therapy leading to an outcome. A sentence like"admitted with Hodgkin, now 8 days post-reinfusion" effectively sets the focusof the current atte


ntion. Yet in doing so, it also smoothes over any diagnosticuncertainties which might have played a role, deleting the deliberations thatwent into the selection of this therapy and Mr. Wood's fears and anxieties.<p>	Finally, all this adds to the peculi


ar feature of written text that oncewritten, it tends to have a privileged position vis a vis other recollectionsof these events (see Clanchy, 1993 for the historical genesis of thisprivilege). Wherever it travels (from the audit committee to the insur


anceinspector's desk to the court room), it becomes <i>the</i> trace to the"original event". As Smith aptly sums these issues up, accounts enter "documenttime" once they are written: "that crucial point at which much if not everytrace of what has gone


 into the making of that account is obliterated and whatremains is only 
the text which aims at being read as `what actually happened'"(1974, p. 
260).<a href="record_fn.html#fn0">12</a> Legal concerns are not the 
only relevant cross-cutting interferenc


es here: thefact that these documents are also (formally and informally) used for qualitycontrol purposes and for the evaluation of colleagues and trainees yieldssimilar consequences. And these are not new interferences: the first official,early twent


ieth century attempts to standardize and improve medical recordkeeping in the USA did not primarily derive from the urge to improve theprimary care process. Rather, they were driven by the absence of means todecide upon certification and accreditation 


of hospitals and individual doctors(Stevens 1989; Waters and Murphy 1979, pp. 4-5). From early on, then, therecord was a crucial element in the generation and reproduction of this complexbody politic.<p><p><p><i>The body politic of the clinic</


i><p><i></i><p></i>	Analogous to its involvement in the production of a 
patient's body, themedical record is involved in the production and reproduction of the bodypolitic of the clinic. First, it plays a core role in the ongoing reproductionof the hospi


tal's temporal structure. Triggering sequenced measurementsproduces <i>both</i> a graph in a record and circumscribed, cyclical work tasksfor nurses. The unstructured progress notes forms require physicians toregularly summarize the current state of af


fairs, and thus create an organizingstructure for their work days. Without the record's core role as a distributingand collecting device, the complex temporal organization of this body politiccould not exist. The record lists which actions are undertak


en and whichactions still to undertake, when which requests or interventions will yieldoutcomes, and who is responsible for the completion of such a task. The flowsheet's medication and infusion lists, for example, function for both nursesand physicia


ns as a list of what has been administered, and as a means to seeat a glance how some crucial measurements have been affected by theseinterventions. In addition, they also organize the work: the ward secretary cansee what type of medication might need 


to be ordered, and nurses can see whento give what, and can subsequently add the infusion dosages for the calculationof the fluid balance. The record, in other words, affords a highly complex,temporally distributed division of labor.<p>	And it thereby


 also maps a complex geography of the hospital. The recorddiscussed here is a so-called "source-oriented" record: by far the most commonmeans of record keeping. It entails ordering the different sections in therecord according to the different institut


ional sources the data are derivedfrom: nursing notes, doctor's notes, laboratory results, bacteriology reports,consultations of different specialties, and so forth.<ahref="record_fn.html#fn0">[13]</a> Again, this does not yield a map whichmerely "rep


resents": it feeds into the reproduction of these geographies.Having their own forms and sections within the record, the nurses are separatedfrom the physicians - both physically and intellectually. Notwithstanding otheralliances or differences, the re


cord clearly differentiates the bacteriologistsvis-&agrave;-vis the radiologists, and sets them both apart, as two isolatedgroups, from the specialists in charge.<p>	The record, moreover, feeds into the reproduction of the hierarchies betweenthese geo


graphical sections. The treating physicians are on top: they write thecentral pages of the record, defining the outlines of the illness trajectoryand incorporating and summarizing information coming from all other sources.They have unlimited access to 


all the sections, but only write there when theoverall course is set. And the other sources are not equal either. Specialistscalled in for consultation will usually fill in their own, yellow consultationforms, but they are allowed to write their findin


gs in the progress notes. Noother discipline is allowed to do this. In addition, the hierarchy is evidentin the way just how much a form is pre-structured. An unstructured forms leavesit to a named author to create order through the production of a nar


rative, andit does not exert demands on the content of these narratives by listingpre-formatted labels - which may remain visibly empty. The physicians' progressnotes are totally unstructured, and the consultancy forms have a few, largesections with l


abels such as "findings, conclusions and advice" - all designedfor free text. The radiographic reports are more brief, but the radiologist isfree to describe the image as s/he pleases, as long as it is followed by aconclusion which answers the treating


 physician's request. The bacteriologist,however, is limited to saying "no growth", "a little growth" or "much growth",and the laboratory workers and nurses can only produce the numbers which end upin the pre-formatted graphs and columns. As Hunter phr


ases it, "the hierarchyof disciplines is very alive in the chart" (1991, p. 88).<ahref="record_fn.html#fn0">[14]</a><p>	The record not only plays a generative role in the organization of the clinic:it also legitimates this organization's design. As we


 have pointed at above,the record tells the story of the <i>work</i> this body politic performs. Oneway of structuring the record has been to make every record a description of aworking organization operating at peak efficiency. Thus record keepers are


advised that the purpose of the record is to tell a story that begins withadmission, describes an every more precise diagnostic process, goes on totreatment and ends with discharge - or, even more "complete" from the medicalrecord keepers' perspective


, death (Waters and Murphy 1979, p. 97). In thiscase the outcome of the record is again the meta-affirmation that allopathicmedicine works - and, ipso facto, that the sites where medicine is performedwork. Every record - as individual as may be - is, t


hrough its very form,testament to this assertion.<p><p><p><i>The professional nursing body</i><p><p>	The fact that the chart maps - and thus feeds into - the hierarchy ofdisciplines in medical work has not gone unnoticed by these disciplinesthemse


lves. Turning to our third example, we encounter a professional groupstriving to enhance its status through attempting to change theserecord-keeping practices. Here, the constitution of a body politic in andthrough the medical record has become a site 


of active contestation. Therecord-keeping practices at stake concern the nursing classification schemedesigned for incorporation within hospital information systems. The scheme, NIC(Nursing Interventions Classification) divides up all of nursing work i


nto aseries of well-defined actions which are then to be coded (allowing nursingadministrators to track the work of their staff). The group at Iowa UniversitySchool of Nursing published a first edition of their system in 1992, and arevised and expande


d version came out in 1996 (Cohen et al. 1991; McCloskey andBulechek 1996). <p>	NIC itself is a fascinating system. Some categories, like "Bleeding Reduction- Nasal - 4024", are on the surface relatively obvious and codable intodiscrete units of work 


practice to be carried out on specific occasions. Butwhat about the equally important categories of hope installation and humor?"Hope Installation - 5310" includes the subcategory of "Avoid masking thetruth". This is not so much something that nurses d


o on a regular basis, assomething that they should not do constantly. It also includes: "Help thepatient expand spiritual self". Here the contribution that the nurse is makingis to an implicit lifelong program of spiritual development. With respect to"


Humor - 5320", the very definition of the category suggests the operation of aparadigm shift: "Facilitating the patient to perceive, appreciate, and expresswhat is funny, amusing, or ludicrous in order to establish relationships"; andit is unclear how 


this could ever be attached to a time line: it is somethingthe nurse should always do while doing other things. Further, contained withinthe nursing classification is an anatomy of what it is to be humorous, and atheory of what humor does. The recommen


ded procedures break humor down intosubelements. One should determine the types of humor appreciated by thepatient; determine the patient's typical response to humor (e.g. laughter orsmiles); select humorous materials that create moderate arousal for t


heindividual (for example picture a forbidding authority figure dressed only inunderwear); encourage silliness and playfulness and so on to make a total offifteen sub-activities: any one of which might be scientifically relevant. Afeature traditionall


y attached to the personality of the nurse (being acheerful and supportive person) is now attached through the classification tothe job description as an intervention which can be accounted for. Theseprocess categories fit into the same numbering schem


e as more punctualcategories such as "Bottle Feeding - 1052" or "Suturing - 3620" - once in therecord, there is no distinction between process and single interventions.<p>	The Iowa group (the kernel of whom are teachers of nursing administration)made 


essentially three arguments for the creation of a nursing classification,initially to nursing informaticians and thence to the hospital informationsystems community. First, it was argued that without a standard language todescribe nursing interventions


, there would be no way of producing a scientificbody of knowledge about nursing. NIC in theory would be articulated with twoother classification systems: NOC (the nursing sensitive patient outcomesclassification scheme) and NANDA (the nursing diagnosi


s scheme). The threecould work together: one could perform studies over a set of hospitalsemploying the three schemes in order to check if a given category of patientresponded well to a given category of nursing intervention. Rather than thiscomparati


ve work being done anecdotally as in the past through the accumulationof experience, it could be done scientifically through the conduct ofexperiments. The second argument for classifying nursing interventions was thatit was a key strategy for defendin


g the professional autonomy of nursing. TheIowa nurses are very aware of the literature on professionalization - notablySch&ouml;n (1983) - and are aware of the force of having an accepted body ofscientific knowledge as their domain. The third argument


 was that nursing,alongside other medical professions, was moving into the new world ofcomputers. As the representational medium changed, it was important to be ableto talk about nursing in a language that computers could understand - elsenursing work


 would not be represented at all in the future, and would riskbeing even further marginalized than it was at present. <p>	The intervention in turn can then be linked by nursing academics to nursingoutcomes in a series of clinical studies. The outcome o


f the records will bethe integration of nursing work into the medical establishment . The expressedfear of professional leaders is that without representation in the informationsystem, the profession of nursing will become ever more marginalized. So th


erecord is producing a patient - as we stressed in the first part of this work -but it is also producing an organizational result. For the nurses, the recordconstitutes, then, building blocks for a <i>body of knowledge, </i>which inturn loops back int


o the hierarchy. In current storage practices, nurses' notesare frequently separated from doctors' notes, and are often destroyedimmediately the patient leaves the hospital (Huffman 1990). A professionalizedform of reporting would create a continuing r


ecord of their activities - whichcould feed into the discipline of 
nursing science and be used to unseat thecurrent hierarchy.<a 
href="record_fn.html#fn0">15</a>	Nurses who met to develop a "nursing 
minimum data set" (modeled on thesuccessful medical 


minimum data set) to be produced by all hospitals in theirmedical records argued that: "the most frequently focused upon language is thatdeveloped by medicine and the numerous natural or physical sciences thatcontribute to medicine's scientific knowled


ge base. This language is focusedupon most frequently by nurses, because of medicine's long history of dominancein nursing, its relative specificity about physiological phenomena, itsapparent measurability, and its familiarity. It is also valued for it


s socialstatus as a scientific language, used by a politically powerful professionalgroup, physicians" (Kritek, 1988, p. 25). It is not enough for nurses toaccurately record what they do - they must record it in a language acceptableto physicians and 


hospital administrators, and productive of a new, higherstatus. For this reason, "leech treatment" was not initially recognized as aNIC category - even though it was indeed a treatment and was indeed carried outby a number of nurses (Neumann, forthcomi


ng). The nursing record had to be seento be "professional" in order for it to do its work. That work is, in part, themodeling of nursing on the example of medicine; itself modeled (with the helpof the medical record, as we saw above) in the image of pu


rescience.<i></i><p><i></i><p><p><i>Multiplicity: Interoperability and Infrastructure</i><p><i></i><p>	It is turning into a complex thing, our medical record. It produces multiplebodies and underwrites a number of ever-shifting organizational 


configurations.For the nurses, the medical record is a crucial tool in their organizationalstruggle for status at the same time as it is a record of what happened to thepatient, a legal document, and a tool which organizes their daily work. It mustbe 


able to do all these jobs at once - and for all those working with it. Inthe multiplicity of context the record is drawn into (and helps to constitute),materially different objects are at play: most physicians never get to see thecoding forms used by t


he coders; most record administration coders know littleof the elaborate nursing coding schemes; most nurses primarily draw on thenursing record during their work, and so forth.<p>	As we have seen, medical records are involved in the production of mult


iplebodies politic. Consider the legal reading of the record that we havediscussed. In this reading, the legal narrative is the chief concern, and somefeatures of the record are activated as relevant for the story to be properlytold. It may not matter


 for the nursing record whether or not a giventemperature reading was taken, but this may make a large difference legally (asindicative of contributory negligence). So medical records do not have to do asingle job, they have to be configured in such a 


way that a set of differentorganizations are serviced by them. To borrow the vocabulary of informationscience they have to serve as <i>infrastructure </i>(Star and Ruhleder,1996)<i> </i>to a set of organizations. They have to do this in such a way that


these organizations can use the medical records in conjunction with otherrecords that they generate. Thus for example you want the medical record tostore information about ethnicity in a way which makes sense to epidemiologistsand to public health off


icials - so that in turn these groups can deploy therecords in conjunction with other records that they produce to track diseases.Again to borrow the vocabulary of information science, we can say that themedical record needs to guarantee <i>interoperab


ility</i>. In this section, weshall see that fashioning of medical records into infrastructural toolsguaranteeing interoperability involves a series of organizational alignments ofgreat political and ethical importance. Just as for the patients in thep


revious section above, there is a real <i>multiplicity</i> of organizationsproduced by the records. Just as for the patients, this conflicts with arhetoric of singularity (the convergence of traces on a single ideal patienttemporality and geography and


 on a single ideal organizational context).<p>	A recent history of medical informatics notes that: "... by the 1980s, theprovision of health care in the United States had three dimensions ofintegration for patient care information: <i>local integration


</i> ofinformation in hospitals or in physicians' offices; <i>vertical integration</i>of information between affiliated hospitals and medical offices; and<i>horizontal integration </i>among associated hospitals, clinics, andcommunity health and welfar


e support groups" (Collen 1995, p. 82). Each ofthese forms of integration (which cannot be as neatly separated off from eachother as Collen implies) entail a different form of interoperability. Therecord has to be aligned with the needs of the organiza


tions associated withthem. This involves, for one thing, matching of the different timetables andgeographies the records produce. Roth (1979) discusses the difficulty of atuberculosis patient traveling to a new sanatorium without there being anagreed-


upon language for describing the patient's condition; the NIC nursesdespair of ever producing nursing knowledge without comparability (Timmermanset al. forthcoming). But this integration also extends to relationships withhealth care providers, public h


ealth officials, the World Health Organization(which maintains the International Classification of Diseases), the legalprofession and so forth: as we have pointed out, the record is increasinglyseen as a vital source for these "third parties" as well. 


With the developmentof computer based records, a further dimension is introduced by the needs ofthe programmers. Thus at a meeting discussing the development of the NICclassification, for example, nursing informaticians protested the existence of"nest


ed classifications" within NIC - that is to say an intervention containinganother within it. They argued that this made for difficulties in programmingthe appropriate screens on the electronic nursing record.<p>	With the extension of the record's reach


 through different times, spaces andinto novel domains, much work is done <i>on</i> the record to ensure that thesemultiple configurations continue to be possible. Much of this work seems"purely technical"; appears far removed from organizational or po


liticalissues. Consider the sets of committees that have been involved withstandardizing medical informatics:<p><p>The American Standard for Testing Materials (ASTM) subcommittee E31.12subcommittee framed nomenclatures and medical records. In 1988, A


STM sub-coE31.12 published standards for patient discharge and transfer data. HealthLevel Seven (HL7) an organization made up of vendors, hospitals and consultantswas organized in 1987 to develop interface standards for transmitting databetween applic


ations that used different computers within HISs. The messagecontent of HL7 was to conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO)standards for the applications level 7 of the Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model; the HL7 standard used the


 same message syntax, the same data typesand some of the same segment definitions as ASTM. The Medical Data Interchange(MEDIX) P1157 committee of the IEEE, formed at the SCAMC 1987 was alsodeveloping a set of standards, based on the ISO application-lev


el standards,for the transferring of clinical data over large networks from mixed sources,such as from a clinical lab and a pharmacy, for both intra- and interhospitalcommunications. (Collen 1995, p. 109)<p><p>	Each of these interconnections was the 


product of a continuing effort tomaintain and stabilize an infrastructure. Janet Abbate (forthcoming) hasdemonstrated how the OSI standards are themselves the fragile outcome of aseries of negotiations between a computing industry wanting to retain the


proprietary edge of a closed system, government regulators, public pressuregroups and so forth. As you spiral down into the infrastructure you get beyonda particular database in a hospital to the technical standards (OSI)underwriting that database; an


d as you follow OSI in development you witness atitanic struggle between company interest and the public good being written incode. This is typical for infrastructure: the "harder" you go, the<i>closer</i> you get to organizational and political concer


ns (see alsoHanseth et al. 1996, and see Carlson 1991 who makes this point brilliantly forinnovation in the electrical industry).<p>	All these standardization efforts do not do away with the continuing need tobalance the needs exerted within the diffe


rent networks that interconnectthrough the infrastructure (Bowker and Star 1994; Timmermans and Berg 1997).The ever unattainable ideal of pure, quantifiable knowledge remains a drivingorganizing force - even when it is patently absurd. Consider the cas


e of fluidbalance - this is precisely measured to the milliliter in intensive care units,and then a fudge factor out of all proportion to the data is added in forsweating (which cannot be so simply measured). Why is this ideal so successfulin organizi


ng infrastructures and guaranteeing interoperability? One answer isthat it generates alignments. If we are all striving in the same directionthen, whether or not the direction itself is a good one, our sets of fudgefactors and uncertainties will tend t


o align with each other. An analogy herewould be to the story of the emperor's new clothes. If everyone seeks todescribe the world in ways acceptable to the others around them, then theemperor will be seen to well dressed - whether or not he is - if on


e person isout of alignment, the whole may crumble. This, we would argue, is one reasonwhy formal records entail such deep organizational discipline.<p>	The nurses producing NIC believe deeply that the current system of accountinginscribed in the hosp


ital information systems is wrong-headed. Thus in a June1995 meeting, co-leader of the NIC team JoAnne McCloskey mentioned the rise ofactivity-based accounting, meaning that individual activities had to be costed.She went on to effectively deconstruct 


this in much the same vein as DickBoland (1996) has done from within the field of Management and InformationScience. Nurse practitioners, she noted, see patients for longer than doctors -since they are teaching, and preventing re-occurrence etc. Until 


you pull outproductivity against performance one cannot see this. This was also a problem,she noted, for women physicians (who see patients longer, and need to see themless as a result - so on a productivity measure it looks like they are workingmore 


slowly). However the productivity measures being used were based on thefactory measure of how many widgets an hour you produce. Crucially, she went onto say that: "Nursing needs to speak the language used elsewhere. This is whywe need to use a restrict


ed definition of productivity". In our terms, she ispointing to the need for interoperability of the nursing records with othermedical records. And indeed in the NIC email list she soon floated an attemptto pin times to interventions (difficult in the 


case of emotional support andactive listening; but not obvious even for bowel incontinence care...). Andindeed in order to speak the language of accountancy well enough to justify anew nursing slot, the organization had to be recorded as having worked 


in aparticularly well defined set of temporal slots. Here is a sample argument thatuses the assignation of time slots to NIC interventions to justify the creationof a new nursing position in a given hospital. This argment was presented tonursing admin


istrators and nursing information specialists at the samemeeting:<p><p><u>Position justification</u><p>Teaching/ discussion/ process			time<p>individ. teaching				8<p>prescribed medic.				15<p>prescribed procedure				10<p>treatment					30<p>63 mi


nutes by 620 new patients per year = 39,060 minutes or 651 hours.<p>651 hours divided by 2000 = .3 FTE. (FTE being "full time equivalent").<p><p>	What is happening here is that a key player in the production and maintenanceof the medical record - the 


nurse - does not believe in the validity of thetraces that they are producing of their own work in the record; and yet theyhave to both write records as if such traces were true and write them wellenough so that nursing should be seen to be a key playe


r in the efficientscientific treatment of patients (rather than a prime candidate for costcutting). What a strange irony! It is, we would argue, an extreme example of avery common phenomenon.<i> </i>Consider the case discussed at length by Young(1995)


 and Kirk and Kutchins (1992) of psychoanalysts who in order to receivereimbursement for this procedures need to couch them in a biomedical languagethat is anathema to them, but is the lingua franca of the medical insurancecompanies. The nurses have po


tential allies - there are radical accountants,radical doctors, critical medical informaticians: but the need to align isimmediate; the risks of disappearing forever from the medical record too greatto make the risk of challenging the common language w


orthwhile. Local use ofthe record underwrites organizational multiplicity (nurses will continue to beconcerned with process; psychoanalysts with the id) at the same time as theconstrained form of the record evokes a single large medical organization wi


thguaranteed interoperability of its "departments" (nursing, epidemiology, publichealth, medical insurance and so forth) - just as the patient's body is at onceconjured into a single time and space while remaining locally multiple. <p>	Infrastructures


 underwrite alignment of the organizations that they areinfrastructural to; and a key feature of this alignment in the case of themedical record is the evanescent ideal of the scientific operation of medicine.As Latour (1988) has argued in an analysis 


of Pasteur, much of the power ofscience comes from such alignment. This alignment is not ever completed orentirely successful: however large techno-economic networks cannot existwithout it. The medical record produces organizations which can configure 


theirown records such that a privileged set of stories (due process; medicalscience; nursing efficiency) can be told again and again. <p><p><p><b>Conclusion</b><p><p>	The medical record, it has become clear, is a complex object, and afascinating a


nd crucial focus for sociological research. It feeds into thatwhat it merely seems to represent; it is a crucial element in the constitutionof the patient's body (inscribed in a set of spaces and times) and of thehospital as a formal organization (equa


lly inscribed in a set of spaces andtimes). It is a site where both the constitution of the patient and theconstitution of the hospital worker is at work: the bodies and bodies politicthey inhabit are reinscribed into novel places, broken apart in new 


ways, andconfigured into spaces and times out of their control. Seen in this light, as asite where multiple stories about patients and about organizations are at stake(including the interoperability between these stories), the medical recordbecomes hi


ghly relevant both analytically and politically. There is a strongcurrent "push", for example, towards the implementation of the electronicmedical record - and when the record is seen as an innocuous storage device,the appropriate implementation is oft


en seen as a "technical problem", or as amatter of finding the "appropriate interface". When it is acknowledged that themedical record is interwoven with the structure of medical work in fundamentalways, that different medical record systems embody dif


ferent notions of howwork is organized, different modes of configuring patient bodies, and so forth,we are in a position to better understand and intervene upon the issues thatare at stake. We are reminded of Latour's (1987) observation that science is


bureaucracy or Serres' equation of law and science (1987): the site of thecreation of organization and body is the bureaucratic work of creatinginscriptions. To end where we began: this site thereby becomes a key site forthe arrogation and exercise of


 power.<p><b>Notes</b><p><b></b><p><p><b>Acknowledgements</b><p><p>Marc Berg would like to thank the Dutch Association for Scientific Research(NWO) for making this research possible. We thank the two anonymous referees,Emilie Gomart, Leigh Star an
