<h3>Suggested (pre-approved?) Project/Paper Topics</h3>
<ul>
<li> Tools for identifying, managing, and tracking event flow in apps

<li> Supporting cut-and-paste in a dynamic C2 architecture
(related to OLE and OpenDoc models for embedded editing)

<li> Supporting fast semantic feedback in C2-style architectures

<li> Supporting selective undo in a disributed groupware application
using C2-style architectures.  May include general mechanisms for
utilizing the command object notion of Olsen:Chapters 14-15 as the
basis for message structures.  Reformulate the C2 frameworks based on
an improved notion of message?

<li> A full domain-specific (?) software architecture based for editing
applications, starting from the ideas of Olsen:Chapter 12.

<li>  Re-engineer the Endeavors UI to support undo and editing of all
three kinds of fundamental Endeavors objects, using ideas from
Olsen:Chapter 12.

<li>  JavaBeans and Swing:  an evaluation and methodology for use
within the C2 context (connectors and C2 framework).

<li> A new approach to support compositional or distributed (or both)
user interfaces (may start out as a survey/issues/objectives
paper/project)

</ul>
<!--

re-engineer Jason's GEF to be built in C2 style and to support undo/redo

circuit editor in C2

task analysis??
  simple, then follow-up with implementation?
     of the travel-expense process
  seems wrong for this class
