<h1>Minimum Spanning Trees</h1>

<h2>Spanning trees</h2>

A <i>spanning tree</i> of a graph is just a subgraph that contains
all the vertices and is a tree. A graph may have many spanning
trees; for instance the complete graph on four vertices 

<pre>
    o---o
    |\ /|
    | X |
    |/ \|
    o---o
</pre>

has sixteen spanning trees: 

<pre>
    o---o    o---o    o   o    o---o
    |   |    |        |   |        |
    |   |    |        |   |        |
    |   |    |        |   |        |
    o   o    o---o    o---o    o---o

    o---o    o   o    o   o    o   o
     \ /     |\ /      \ /      \ /|
      X      | X        X        X |
     / \     |/ \      / \      / \|

    | \ |      /      | / |      \

<h2>Minimum spanning trees</h2>

Now suppose the edges of the graph have weights or lengths. The
weight of a tree is just the sum of weights of its edges.
Obviously, different trees have different lengths. The problem: how
to find the minimum length spanning tree? 

<p>This problem can be solved by many different algorithms. It is
the topic of some very recent research. There are several "best"
algorithms, depending on the assumptions you make:</p>

<ul>
<li>A randomized algorithm can solve it in linear expected time.
[Karger, Klein, and Tarjan, "A randomized linear-time algorithm to
find minimum spanning trees", J. ACM, vol. 42, 1995, pp.
321-328.]</li>

<li>It can be solved in linear worst case time if the weights are
small integers. [Fredman and Willard, "Trans-dichotomous algorithms
for minimum spanning trees and shortest paths", 31st IEEE Symp.
Foundations of Comp. Sci., 1990, pp. 719--725.] <a name="beta">
</a></li>

<li>Otherwise, the best solution is very close to linear but not
exactly linear. The exact bound is O(m log beta(m,n)) where the
beta function has a complicated definition: the smallest i such
that log(log(log(...log(n)...))) is less than m/n, where the logs
are nested i times. [Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan, Efficient
algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees in undirected and
directed graphs. Combinatorica, vol. 6, 1986, pp. 109--122.]</li>
</ul>

These algorithms are all quite complicated, and probably not that
great in practice unless you're looking at really huge graphs. The
book tries to keep things simpler, so it only describes one
algorithm but (in my opinion) doesn't do a very good job of it.
I'll go through three simple classical algorithms (spending not so
much time on each one). 

<h2>Why minimum spanning trees?</h2>

<a name="phone">The standard application is to a problem like phone
network design. You have a business with several offices; you want
to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the
phone company charges different amounts of money to connect
different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects
all your offices with a minimum total cost. It should be a spanning
tree, since if a network isn't a tree you can always remove some
edges and save money.</a> 

<p><a name="tsp">A less obvious application is that the minimum
spanning tree can be used to approximately solve the traveling
salesman problem. A convenient formal way of defining this problem
is to find the shortest path that visits each point at least
once.</a></p>

<p>Note that if you have a path visiting all points exactly once,
it's a special kind of tree. For instance in the example above,
twelve of sixteen spanning trees are actually paths. If you have a
path visiting some vertices more than once, you can always drop
some edges to get a tree. So in general the MST weight is less than
the TSP weight, because it's a minimization over a strictly larger
set.</p>

<p><a name="chris">On the other hand, if you draw a path tracing
around the minimum spanning tree, you trace each edge twice and
visit all points, so the TSP weight is less than twice the MST
weight. Therefore this tour is within a factor of two of optimal.
There is a more complicated way (<i><a href= 
"people.html#christofides">Christofides</a>' heuristic</i>) of
using minimum spanning trees to find a tour within a factor of 1.5
of optimal; I won't describe this here but it might be covered in
ICS 163 (graph algorithms) next year.</a></p>

<h2>How to find minimum spanning tree?</h2>

The stupid method is to list all spanning trees, and find minimum
of list. We already know how to find minima... But there are far
too many trees for this to be efficient. It's also not really an
algorithm, because you'd still need to know how to list all the
trees. 

<p>A better idea is to find some key property of the MST that lets
us be sure that some edge is part of it, and use this property to
build up the MST one edge at a time.</p>

<p>For simplicity, we assume that there is a unique minimum
spanning tree. (Problem 4.3 of Baase is related to this
assumption). You can get ideas like this to work without this
assumption but it becomes harder to state your theorems or write
your algorithms precisely.</p>

<blockquote>Lemma: Let X be any subset of the vertices of G, and
let edge e be the smallest edge connecting X to G-X. Then e is part
of the minimum spanning tree. 

<p>Proof: Suppose you have a tree T not containing e; then I want
to show that T is not the MST. Let e=(u,v), with u in X and v not
in X. Then because T is a spanning tree it contains a unique path
from u to v, which together with e forms a cycle in G. This path
has to include another edge f connecting X to G-X. T+e-f is another
spanning tree (it has the same number of edges, and remains
connected since you can replace any path containing f by one going
the other way around the cycle). It has smaller weight than t since
e has smaller weight than f. So T was not minimum, which is what we
wanted to prove.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Kruskal's algorithm</h2>

We'll start with <a href="people.html#kruskal">Kruskal</a>'s
algorithm, which is easiest to understand and probably the best one
for solving problems by hand. 

<pre>
    Kruskal's algorithm:
    sort the edges of G in increasing order by length
    keep a subgraph S of G, initially empty
    for each edge e in sorted order
        if the endpoints of e are disconnected in S
        add e to S
    return S
</pre>

Note that, whenever you add an edge (u,v), it's always the smallest
connecting the part of S reachable from u with the rest of G, so by
the lemma it must be part of the MST. 

<p>This algorithm is known as a <i>greedy algorithm</i>, because it
chooses at each step the cheapest edge to add to S. You should be
very careful when trying to use greedy algorithms to solve other
problems, since it usually doesn't work. E.g. if you want to find a
shortest path from a to b, it might be a bad idea to keep taking
the shortest edges. The greedy idea only works in Kruskal's
algorithm because of the key property we proved.</p>

<p><a name="uf">Analysis: The line testing whether two endpoints
are disconnected looks like it should be slow (linear time per
iteration, or O(mn) total). But actually there are some complicated
data structures that let us perform each test in close to constant
time; this is known as the <i>union-find</i> problem and is
discussed in Baase section 8.5 (I won't get to it in this class,
though). The slowest part turns out to be the sorting step, which
takes O(m log n) time.</a></p>

<h2>Prim's algorithm</h2>

Rather than build a subgraph one edge at a time, <a href= 
"people.html#prim">Prim</a>'s algorithm builds a tree one vertex at
a time. 

<pre>
    Prim's algorithm:
    let T be a single vertex x
    while (T has fewer than n vertices)
    {
        find the smallest edge connecting T to G-T
        add it to T
    }
</pre>

Since each edge added is the smallest connecting T to G-T, the
lemma we proved shows that we only add edges that should be part of
the MST. 

<p>Again, it looks like the loop has a slow step in it. But again,
some data structures can be used to speed this up. The idea is to
use a <a href="960116.html#binheap">heap</a> to remember, for each
vertex, the smallest edge connecting T with that vertex.</p>

<pre>
    Prim with heaps:
    make a heap of values (vertex,edge,weight(edge))
        initially (v,-,infinity) for each vertex
        let tree T be empty
    while (T has fewer than n vertices)
    {
        let (v,e,weight(e)) have the smallest weight in the heap
        remove (v,e,weight(e)) from the heap
        add v and e to T
        for each edge f=(u,v)
        if u is not already in T
            find value (u,g,weight(g)) in heap
            if weight(f) &lt; weight(g)
            replace (u,g,weight(g)) with (u,f,weight(f))
    }
</pre>

<a name="fib">Analysis: We perform n steps in which we remove the
smallest element in the heap, and at most 2m steps in which we
examine an edge f=(u,v). For each of those steps, we might replace
a value on the heap, reducing it's weight. (You also have to find
the right value on the heap, but that can be done easily enough by
keeping a pointer from the vertices to the corresponding values.) I
haven't described how to reduce the weight of an element of a
binary heap, but it's easy to do in O(log n) time. Alternately by
using a more complicated data structure known as a Fibonacci heap,
you can reduce the weight of an element in constant time. The
result is a total time bound of O(m + n log n).</a>
<h2>Boruvka's algorithm</h2>

(Actually <a href="people.html#boruvka">Boruvka</a> should be
spelled with a small raised circle accent over the "u".) Although
this seems a little complicated to explain, it's probably the
easiest one for computer implementation since it doesn't require
any complicated data structures. The idea is to do steps like
Prim's algorithm, in parallel all over the graph at the same time. 

<pre>
    Boruvka's algorithm:
    make a list L of n trees, each a single vertex
    while (L has more than one tree)
        for each T in L, find the smallest edge connecting T to G-T
        add all those edges to the MST
        (causing pairs of trees in L to merge)
</pre>

As we saw in Prim's algorithm, each edge you add must be part of
the MST, so it must be ok to add them all at once. 

<p>Analysis: This is similar to merge sort. Each pass reduces the
number of trees by a factor of two, so there are O(log n) passes.
Each pass takes time O(m) (first figure out which tree each vertex
is in, then for each edge test whether it connects two trees and is
better than the ones seen before for the trees on either endpoint)
so the total is O(m log n).</p>

<h2>A hybrid algorithm</h2>

This isn't really a separate algorithm, but you can combine two of
the classical algorithms and do better than either one alone. The
idea is to do O(log log n) passes of Boruvka's algorithm, then
switch to Prim's algorithm. Prim's algorithm then builds one large
tree by connecting it with the small trees in the list L built by
Boruvka's algorithm, keeping a heap which stores, for each tree in
L, the best edge that can be used to connect it to the large tree.
Alternately, you can think of collapsing the trees found by
Boruvka's algorithm into "supervertices" and running Prim's
algorithm on the resulting smaller graph. The point is that this
reduces the number of remove min operations in the heap used by
Prim's algorithm, to equal the number of trees left in L after
Boruvka's algorithm, which is O(n / log n). 

<p>Analysis: O(m log log n) for the first part, O(m + (n/log n) log
n) = O(m + n) for the second, so O(m log log n) total.</p>
