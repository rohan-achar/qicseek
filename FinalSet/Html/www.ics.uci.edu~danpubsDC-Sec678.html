Empirical tests of the efficiencies of the algorithms presented here
are reported in [Bentley et al. 1986; 
Knuth 1985; Schwartz and Kallick 1964; Vitter 1987; Welch 1984].
These experiments compare the number of bits per word
required and processing time is not reported.  While theoretical
considerations bound the performance of the various algorithms,
experimental data is invaluable in providing additional insight.
It is clear that the performance of each of these methods is 
dependent upon the characteristics of the source ensemble.
<P>
Schwartz and Kallick test an implementation of
static Huffman coding in which bottom merging is used to determine
codeword lengths and all codewords of a given length are sequential
binary numbers [Schwartz and Kallick 1964].  The source alphabet in 
the experiment consists
of 5,114 frequently-used English words, 27 geographical names,
10 numerals, 14 symbols, and 43 suffixes.  The entropy of the 
document is 8.884 binary digits per message and the average codeword 
constructed has length 8.920.  The same document is also coded 
one character at a time.  In this case, the entropy of the source is 
4.03 and the coded ensemble contains an average of 4.09 bits per
letter.  The redundancy is low in both cases.  However, the
<EM>relative redundancy</EM> (i.e., redundancy/entropy) is lower when
the document is encoded by words.

Knuth describes algorithm FGK's performance on three types of data:
a file containing the text of Grimm's first ten Fairy Tales, 
text of a technical book,
and a file of graphical data [Knuth 1985].  For the first two files, the
source messages are individual characters and the alphabet size is 128.
The same data is coded using pairs of characters, so that the alphabet
size is 1968.  For the graphical data, the number of source messages 
is 343. In the case of the Fairy Tales the performance
of FGK is very close to optimum, although performance degrades with 
increasing file size.
Performance on the technical book is not as good, but is still 
respectable.  The graphical data proves harder yet to
compress, but again FGK performs reasonably well.  In the latter
two cases, the trend of performance degradation with file size continues.
Defining source messages to consist of character pairs results in
slightly better compression, but the difference would not appear to justify
the increased memory requirement imposed by the larger alphabet.

Vitter tests the performance of algorithms V and FGK against that of 
static Huffman coding.
Each method is run on data which includes Pascal source code, 
the TeX source of the author's
thesis, and electronic mail files [Vitter 1987].  Figure 6.1 summarizes
the results of the experiment for a small file of text.  The performance
of each algorithm is measured by the number of bits in the coded ensemble and
overhead costs are not included.  
Compression achieved by each algorithm is represented by the size of the
file it creates, given as a percentage of the original file size.
Figure 6.2 presents data for Pascal source code.  For the TeX source, the
alphabet consists of 128 individual characters; for the other two file
types, no more than 97 characters appear.  For each experiment, when 
the overhead
costs are taken into account, algorithm V outperforms static Huffman 
coding as long as the size of the message
ensemble (number of characters) is no more than 10^4.  Algorithm FGK 
displays slightly
higher costs, but never more than 100.4% of the static algorithm.

Witten et al. compare adaptive arithmetic coding with adaptive Huffman
coding [Witten et al. 1987].  The version of arithmetic coding tested
employs single-character adaptive frequencies and is a mildly optimized
C implementation.  Witten et al. compare the results provided by this
version of arithmetic coding with the results achieved by the UNIX
<EM>compact</EM> program (<EM>compact</EM> is based on algorithm FGK).
On three large files which typify data compression
applications, compression achieved by arithmetic coding is better than
that provided by <EM>compact</EM>, but only slightly better (average file
size is 98% of the <EM>compact</EM>ed size).  A file over a three-character
alphabet, with very skewed
symbol probabilities, is encoded by arithmetic coding in less than one
bit per character; the resulting file size is 74% of the size of the 
file generated by <EM>compact</EM>.  Witten et al. also report encoding
and decoding times.  The encoding time of arithmetic coding is generally 
half of the time required by the adaptive Huffman coding method.
Decode time averages 65% of the time required by <EM>compact</EM>.
Only in the case of the skewed file are the time statistics quite
different.  Arithmetic coding again achieves faster encoding, 67% of
the time required by <EM>compact</EM>.  However, <EM>compact</EM> decodes
more quickly, using only 78% of the time of the arithmetic method. 
<P>
Bentley et al. use C and Pascal source files, TROFF source files, and a
terminal session transcript of several hours for experiments which
compare the performance of algorithm BSTW to static Huffman coding.
Here the defined words consist of two disjoint classes, 
sequences of alphanumeric characters and sequences of
nonalphanumeric characters.
The performance of algorithm BSTW is very close to that of static
Huffman coding in all cases.  The experiments reported by Bentley et al.
are of particular interest in that they incorporate
another dimension, the possibility that in the move-to-front
scheme one might want to limit the size of the data structure containing
the codes to include only the <VAR>m</VAR> most recent words, for some <VAR>m</VAR> [Bentley et al. 1986].  The
tests consider cache sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256.  Although
performance tends to increase with cache size, the increase is erratic,
with some documents exhibiting nonmonotonicity (performance
which increases with cache size to a point and then decreases when cache
size is further increased).
<P>
Welch reports simulation results for Lempel-Ziv codes
in terms of compression ratios [Welch 1984].
His definition of compression ratio is the one given in
<a href="DC-Sec1.html#Sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a>,
<VAR>C</VAR> = (average message length)/(average codeword length).  The ratios
reported are:  1.8 for English text, 2 to 6 for Cobol data files, 1.0 for
floating point arrays, 2.1 for formatted scientific data, 2.6 for system
log data, 2.3 for source code, and 1.5 for object code.  The tests involving
English text files showed that long
individual documents did not compress better than groups of
short documents. 
This observation is somewhat surprising, in that it seems to refute the
intuition that redundancy is due at least in part to correlation in content.
For purposes of comparison, Welch cites results of Pechura and Rubin. 
Pechura achieved a 1.5 compression ratio using static Huffman coding on files of
English text [Pechura 1982].
Rubin reports a 2.4 ratio for English text when employing a complex technique
for choosing the source messages to which Huffman coding is applied
[Rubin 1976].
These results provide only a very weak basis for comparison, since the
characteristics of the files used by the three authors are unknown.
It is very likely that a single algorithm may produce compression ratios
ranging from 1.5 to 2.4, depending upon the source to which it is
applied.

<H2> 7.  SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ERROR</H2> </a>

<a href="#Sec_6"><IMG SRC="prev.gif" ALT="PREV section"></A>

<P>

The discrete noiseless channel is, unfortunately,
not a very realistic model of a communication system.  Actual data 
transmission systems are prone
to two types of error: <EM>phase error</EM>, in which a code symbol
is lost or gained; and <EM>amplitude error</EM>, in which a code
symbol is corrupted [Neumann 1962].
The degree to which channel errors degrade transmission is
an important parameter in the choice of a data compression
method.  The susceptibility to error of a coding algorithm
depends heavily on whether the method is static or adaptive.

<a name="Sec_7.1">
<H3> 7.1  Static Codes</H3> </a>

It is generally known that Huffman codes tend to be self-correcting
[Standish 1980].  That is, a transmission error tends not to propagate 
too far.  The codeword in which the error occurs is incorrectly
received and it is likely that several subsequent codewords are misinterpreted
but, before too long, the receiver is back in synchronization with the sender.
In a static code, synchronization means simply that both sender and
receiver identify the beginnings of the codewords in the
same way.  In Figure 7.1, an example is used
to illustrate the ability of a Huffman code to recover from
phase errors. The message ensemble "<kbd>BCDAEB</kbd>" is encoded using
the Huffman code of Figure 3.4 where the 
source letters <VAR>a</VAR>(1) ... <VAR>a</VAR>(5) represent <VAR>A ... E</VAR>
respectively, yielding the coded ensemble "<kbd>0110100011000011</kbd>".
Figure 7.1 demonstrates the impact of loss of the first bit, the second
bit, or the fourth bit.  
The dots show the way in which each line is parsed
into codewords. The loss of the first bit results in re-synchronization
after the third bit so that only the first source message (<VAR>B</VAR>) is lost
(replaced by <VAR>AA</VAR>).
When the second bit is lost, the first eight bits of the coded ensemble
are misinterpreted and synchronization is regained by bit 9.  
Dropping the fourth bit causes the same
degree of disturbance as dropping the second.

Figure 7.2 -- Recovery from amplitude errors
</PRE>

The effect of amplitude errors is demonstrated in Figure 7.2.
The format of the illustration is the same as that in Figure 7.1.  This time
bits 1, 2, and 4 are inverted rather than lost.  Again
synchronization is regained almost immediately.  When bit 1 or bit 2 is changed,
only the first three bits (the first character of the ensemble) are disturbed.
Inversion of bit four causes loss of synchronization through the ninth bit.
A very simple explanation of the self-synchronization present in these
example can be given.  Since many of the codewords end in the same sequence
of digits, the decoder is likely to reach a leaf of the Huffman code tree
at one of the codeword boundaries of the original coded ensemble.  When
this happens, the decoder is back in synchronization with the encoder.
So that self-synchronization may be discussed more carefully,
the following definitions are presented.  (It should be noted that
these definitions hold for arbitrary prefix codes, so that the discussion
includes all of the codes described in
<a href="DC-Sec3.html#Sec_3">Section 3</a>.)  If <VAR>s</VAR> is a suffix of some 
codeword and there exist sequences of codewords <VAR>Gamma</VAR> and <VAR>Delta</VAR> 
such that <VAR>s Gamma</VAR> = <VAR>Delta</VAR>, then <VAR>Gamma</VAR> is said to be a 
<VAR>synchronizing sequence</VAR> for <VAR>s</VAR>.  For example, in the Huffman
code used above, 1 is a synchronizing sequence for the suffix 01 while
both 000001 and 011 are synchronizing sequences for the suffix 10.
If every suffix (of every codeword) has a synchronizing sequence,
then the code is <EM>completely self-synchronizing</EM>.  If some
or none of the proper suffixes have synchronizing sequences, then the
code is, respectively, <EM>partially-</EM> or <EM>never-self-synchronizing</EM>.
Finally, if there exists a sequence <VAR>Gamma</VAR> which is a synchronizing
sequence for every suffix, <VAR>Gamma</VAR> is defined to be a <EM>universal
synchronizing sequence</EM>.  The code used in the examples above is
completely self-synchronizing, and has universal synchronizing
sequence 00000011000.  Gilbert and Moore prove that the 
existence of a universal synchronizing sequence is a necessary as well
as a sufficient condition for a code to be completely self-synchronizing
[Gilbert and Moore 1959].   They also state that any prefix code
which is completely self-synchronizing will synchronize itself with
probability 1 if the source ensemble consists of successive messages
independently chosen with any given set of probabilities. 
This is true since the probability of occurrence of
the universal synchronizing sequence at any given time is positive.
<P>
It is important to realize that the fact that a completely self-synchronizing
code will re-synchronize with probability 1 does not guarantee recovery
from error with bounded delay.  In fact, for every completely self-synchronizing
prefix code with more than two codewords, there are errors within one
codeword which cause unbounded error propagation [Neumann 1962]. 
In addition, prefix codes are not always completely self-synchronizing.
Bobrow and Hakimi state a necessary condition for
a prefix code with codeword lengths <VAR>l</VAR>(1) ... <VAR>l</VAR>(<VAR>r</VAR>) to be completely
self-synchronizing:  the greatest common divisor of the <VAR>l</VAR>(<VAR>i</VAR>) must
be equal to one [Bobrow and Hakimi 1969].  The Huffman code
{ 00, 01, 10, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 } is not completely
self-synchronizing, but is partially self-synchronizing since
suffixes 00, 01 and 10 are synchronized by any codeword.  
The Huffman code { 000, 0010, 0011, 01, 100, 1010, 1011, 100, 111 }
is never-self-synchronizing.  Examples of never-self-synchronizing
Huffman codes are difficult to construct, and the example above is 
the only one with fewer than 16 source messages.  Stiffler
proves that a code is never-self-synchronizing if and only if
none of the proper suffixes of the codewords are themselves codewords
[Stiffler 1971].
<P>
The conclusions which may be drawn from the above discussion are:
while it is common for Huffman codes to self-synchronize, 
this is not guaranteed; and when self-synchronization is assured,
there is no bound on the propagation of the error.  An additional
difficulty is that self-synchronization provides no indication
that an error has occurred.  
<P>
The problem of error detection and correction in connection with
Huffman codes has not received a great deal of attention.  Several
ideas on the subject are reported here.  
Rudner states that synchronizing sequences should be as short as
possible to minimize re-synchronization delay.  In addition,
if a synchronizing sequence is used as the codeword for a 
high probability message, then re-synchronization will be
more frequent.  A method
for constructing a minimum-redundancy code having the shortest
possible synchronizing sequence is described by Rudner [Rudner 1971].  Neumann
suggests purposely adding some redundancy to Huffman codes
in order to permit detection of certain types of errors 
[Neumann 1962].  Clearly this has to be done carefully, so as
not to negate the redundancy reduction provided by Huffman coding.
McIntyre and Pechura cite data integrity as an advantage of the codebook
approach discussed in
<a href="DC-Sec3.html#Sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a> [McIntyre and Pechura 1985].
When the code is stored separately from the coded data, the code may
be backed up to protect it from perturbation.  However, when the code is
stored or transmitted with the data, it is susceptible to errors.
An error in the code representation constitutes a drastic loss and therefore
extreme measures for protecting this part of the transmission
are justified.
<P>
The Elias codes of <a href="DC-Sec3.html#Sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a>
are not at all robust.  Each of the codes
<VAR>gamma</VAR> and <VAR>delta</VAR> can be thought of as generating codewords which
consist of a number of substrings such that each substring encodes the
length of the subsequent substring.  For code <VAR>gamma</VAR> we may think of
each codeword <VAR>gamma</VAR>(<VAR>x</VAR>) as the concatenation of <VAR>z</VAR>, a string of <VAR>n</VAR> 
zeros, and <VAR>b</VAR>, a string of length <VAR>n</VAR>+1 (<VAR>n</VAR> = floor[ lg <VAR>x</VAR> ] ).
If one of the zeros in substring <VAR>z</VAR> is lost, synchronization will be
lost as the last symbol of <VAR>b</VAR> will be pushed into the next codeword.
<P>
Since the 1 at the front of substring <VAR>b</VAR> delimits the end of <VAR>z</VAR>, if a 
zero in <VAR>z</VAR> is changed to a 1, synchronization will be lost as symbols 
from  <VAR>b</VAR> are pushed into the following codeword.  Similarly, if ones
at the front of <VAR>b</VAR> are inverted to zeros, synchronization will be
lost as the codeword <VAR>gamma</VAR>(<VAR>x</VAR>) consumes symbols from the 
following codeword.  Once synchronization is lost, it cannot 
normally be recovered.
<P>
In Figure 7.3, codewords <VAR>gamma</VAR>(6), <VAR>gamma</VAR>(4), <VAR>gamma</VAR>(8) are used
to illustrate the above ideas.  In each case, synchronization is lost
and never recovered.

Figure 7.3 -- Effects of errors in Elias Codes.
</PRE>

The Elias code <VAR>delta</VAR> may be thought of as a three-part ramp where 
<VAR>delta</VAR>(<VAR>x</VAR>) = <VAR>zmb</VAR> with <VAR>z</VAR> a string of <VAR>n</VAR> zeros, <VAR>m</VAR> a string of
length <VAR>n</VAR>+1 with binary value <VAR>v</VAR>, and <VAR>b</VAR> a string of length <VAR>v</VAR>-1.
For example, in <VAR>delta</VAR>(16)=00.101.0000, <VAR>n</VAR>=2, <VAR>v</VAR>=5, and the
final substring is the binary value of 16 with the leading 1 removed
so that it has length <VAR>v</VAR>-1=4.  Again the fact that each substring
determines the length of the subsequent substring means that an
error in one of the first two substrings is disastrous, changing the
way in which the rest of the codeword is to be interpreted.  And,
like code <VAR>gamma</VAR>, code <VAR>delta</VAR> has no properties which aid in
regaining synchronization once it has been lost.
<P>
The Fibonacci codes of
<a href="DC-Sec3.html#Sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a>, on the other hand, are quite
robust.  This robustness is due to the fact that every codeword
ends in the substring 11 and that substring can appear nowhere else
in a codeword.  If an error occurs anywhere other than in the 11
substring, the error is contained within that one codeword.  It is
possible that one codeword will become two (see the sixth line of 
Figure 7.4), but no other codewords will be disturbed.  If the
last symbol of a codeword is lost or changed, the current codeword
will be fused with its successor, so that two codewords are lost.
When the penultimate bit is disturbed, up to three codewords can
be lost.  For example, the coded message 011.11.011 becomes
0011.1011 if bit 2 is inverted.  The maximum disturbance resulting
from either an amplitude error or a phase error is the disturbance of
three codewords.
<P>
In Figure 7.4, some illustrations based on the Fibonacci coding
of ensemble <VAR>EXAMPLE</VAR> as shown in Figure 3.9 are given.
When bit 3 (which is not part of a 11 substring) is lost or changed,
only a single codeword is degraded.  When bit 6 (the final bit of the
first codeword) is lost or changed, the first two codewords are
incorrectly decoded.  When bit 20
is changed, the first <VAR>b</VAR> is incorrectly decoded as <VAR>fg</VAR>.

<H3> 7.2  Adaptive Codes</H3> </a>

Adaptive codes are far more adversely affected by transmission errors
than are static codes.  For example, in the case of a adaptive
Huffman code, even though the receiver may re-synchronize with
the sender in terms of correctly locating the beginning of a
codeword, the information lost represents more than a few bits or
a few characters of the source ensemble.  The fact that sender
and receiver are dynamically redefining the code indicates
that by the time synchronization is regained, they may have
radically different representations of the code.  Synchronization
as defined in
<a href="#Sec_7.1">Section 7.1</a> refers to synchronization of the bit stream,
which is not sufficient for adaptive methods.  What is needed here
is <EM>code synchronization</EM>, that is, synchronization of both
the bit stream and the dynamic data structure representing the
current code mapping.  
<P>
There is no evidence that adaptive methods
are self-synchronizing.  
Bentley et al. note that, in algorithm BSTW, loss of synchronization
can be catastrophic, whereas this is not true with static Huffman
coding [Bentley et al. 1986].  
Ziv and Lempel recognize that the major
drawback of their algorithm is its susceptibility to error
propagation [Ziv and Lempel 1977].  Welch also considers the
problem of error tolerance of Lempel-Ziv codes and suggests that
the entire ensemble be embedded in an error-detecting code [Welch 1984].
Neither static nor adaptive arithmetic coding has the ability to tolerate
errors.

Data compression is still very much an active research area.
This section suggests possibilities for further study.
<P>
The discussion of
<a href="#Sec_7">Section 7</a> illustrates the susceptibility to error
of the codes presented in this survey.  Strategies for increasing the
reliability of these codes while incurring only a moderate loss of efficiency
would be of great value.  This area appears to be largely unexplored.  
Possible approaches include embedding the entire ensemble
in an error-correcting code or reserving one or more codewords to
act as error flags.  For adaptive
methods it may be necessary for receiver and sender to verify
the current code mapping periodically.  
<P>
For adaptive Huffman coding, Gallager suggests an "aging" scheme,
whereby recent occurrences of a character contribute more to its
frequency count than do earlier occurrences [Gallager 1978].
This strategy introduces the notion of locality into the adaptive
Huffman scheme.  Cormack and Horspool describe an algorithm for
approximating exponential aging [Cormack and Horspool 1984].  However,
the effectiveness of this algorithm has not been established.
<P>
Both Knuth and Bentley et al. suggest the possibility of using
the "cache" concept to exploit locality and minimize the effect
of anomalous source messages. 
Preliminary empirical results indicate that this may be helpful
[Knuth 1985; Bentley et al. 1986].   A problem related to the use
of a cache is overhead time required for deletion.  Strategies
for reducing the cost of a deletion could be considered.
Another possible extension to algorithm BSTW is to investigate other
locality heuristics.  Bentley et al. prove that intermittent-move-to-front
(move-to-front after every <VAR>k</VAR> occurrences) is as effective as
move-to-front [Bentley et al. 1986].  It should be noted that
there are many other self-organizing methods yet to be considered.
Horspool and Cormack describe experimental results which imply that
the transpose heuristic performs as well as move-to-front, and suggest
that it is also easier to implement [Horspool and Cormack 1987].  
<P>
Several aspects of free-parse methods merit further attention. 
Lempel-Ziv codes appear to be promising, although the absence of a worst-case
bound on the redundancy of an individual finite source ensemble
is a drawback.  The variable-block type Lempel-Ziv codes have
been implemented with some success [ARC 1986] and 
the construction of a variable-variable Lempel-Ziv code has been 
sketched [Ziv and Lempel 1978].
The efficiency of the variable-variable model should be investigated.
In addition, an implementation of Lempel-Ziv coding which combines
the time efficiency of Rodeh et al. method with more efficient use of space
is worthy of consideration.

Another important research topic is the development of theoretical models
for data compression which address the problem of local redundancy.
Models based on Markov chains may be exploited to take advantage of
interaction between groups of symbols.  Entropy tends to be overestimated
when symbol interaction is not considered.  Models which exploit
relationships between source messages may achieve better compression 
than predicted by an entropy calculation based only upon symbol probabilities.
The use of Markov modeling is considered by Llewellyn and by Langdon
and Rissanen [Llewellyn 1987; Langdon and Rissanen 1983].

Data compression is a topic of much importance and many applications.
Methods of data compression have been studied for almost four decades.
This paper has provided an overview of data compression methods of
general utility.  The algorithms have been evaluated in terms of
the amount of compression they provide, algorithm efficiency, 
and susceptibility to error.  While algorithm efficiency and susceptibility
to error are relatively independent of the characteristics of the source
ensemble, the amount of compression achieved depends upon the
characteristics of the source to a great extent.

Semantic dependent data compression techniques, as discussed in
<a href="DC-Sec2.html#Sec_2">Section 2</a>, are special-purpose methods designed to exploit
local redundancy or context information.  A semantic dependent scheme
can usually be viewed as a special case of one or more general-purpose
algorithms.  It should also be noted that algorithm BSTW is a general-purpose
technique which exploits locality of reference, a type of local redundancy.

Susceptibility to error is the main drawback of each of the algorithms
presented here.  Although channel errors are more devastating to
adaptive algorithms than to static ones, it is possible for an error
to propagate without limit even in the static case.  Methods of
limiting the effect of an error on the effectiveness of a data
compression algorithm should be investigated.
