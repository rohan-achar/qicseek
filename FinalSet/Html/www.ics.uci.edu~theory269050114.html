Skip Quadtree and Its Applications<BR>
<BR>Speaker: Jonathan Sun
</h2>
<P>
We present a new multi-dimensional data structure, which we call
the skip quadtree (for point data in 2-D) or the skip octree
(for point data in R^d, with d>2). Our data structure combines
the best features of two well-known data structures, in that it
has the well-defined ``box''-shaped regions of region quadtrees
and the logarithmic-height search and update hierarchical
structure of skip lists. We provide efficient algorithms for
inserting and deleting points in a skip quadtree, as well as
fast methods for performing point location queries, approximate
range queries, and approximate nearest neighbor queries.

This is a joint work of David Eppstein, Michael Goodrich and
Jonathan Sun.
