Media hype may portray eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as merely a way 
out of the `browser wars' over control of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), 
but the ability to add new tags and create new document types has wide-
ranging implications for information management within -- and across -- 
organizations. In this talk, we will walk through the XML specification 
and present deployment scenarios with sample Document Type Definitions 
(DTDs), as well as ancillary specifications for XML Linking (XLL) and XML 
Stylesheets (XSL). As time permits, I will also discuss the state of the XML 
software development market and highlight key applications.

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Rohit Khare joined the Ph.D. program in computer science at the 
University of California, Irvine in Fall 1997, after serving as a member 
of the MCI Internet Architecture staff. He was previously on the technical 
staff of the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT, where he focused on security 
and electronic commerce issues. He has been involved in the development of 
cryptographic software tools and Web-related standards development. Rohit 
received a B.S. in Engineering and Applied Science and in Economics from 
California Institute of Technology in 1995.

Today's Web provides people with unprecedented access to online information 
and services. However, because the information is unstructured, computers 
cannot readily understand it. This limitation helps explain why search 
engines and automated shopping agents don't work very well. 

<p>

Tomorrow's Web will provide information and services in a structured form 
that is readily accessible to both people and computers. For Internet 
commerce, this means standard documents for describing things like products, 
airline schedules, stock reports, and bank statements, and corresponding 
forms for placing orders, booking reservations, and making transactions. 
Thousands of companies will use such documents to publish information about 
themselves and their services directly on the Web where they'll be available 
to anyone -- or any web-enabled application -- with the proper authorization. 
FedEx and UPS for example will likely offer shipping services, Citibank and 
Bank of America payment services, and so forth. Customers and suppliers will 
put these services on their intranets and integrate them into their core 
business processes and systems. Businesses will build on each other's 
services, using them as components to create innovative virtual companies, 
markets, and trading communities. This ability to rapidly experiment with 
new business concepts will spark an explosion of entrepreneurial activity 
rivaling that of the web itself.

<strong>Biography: </strong>
Dr. Jay M. Tenenbaum, Chairman and Chief Scientist of Veo Systems Inc., is widely acknowledged as a founder of Internet commerce and the field's leading visionary. In 1990 he started Enterprise Integration Technologies, the company that pioneered the enabling security and payment infrastructure for the Internet. In 1994, he formed CommerceNet industry association and jump-started the Internet
marketplace by convincing 50 leading corporations to get online.  In 
1997, he co-founded CNgroup to extend and commercialize his vision of 
"component-based commerce" in which online businesses interconnect to 
form virtual companies, markets, and trading communities. He remains the 
Chairman of CommerceNet and currently serves on the boards of six 
Internet start-ups.
