<P>&nbsp; The following is a tutorial for <B><FONT SIZE=+1>Chimera 2.0 Beta
</FONT></B>. 
&nbsp;
</p>

<p> Welcome to Chimera, the only freely available open hypermedia system in
existence.  Chimera allows your applications to linked together through a 
series of hypermedia links, even when the items you wish to link are 
plain ASCII text or images.  
</p>

<p> The purpose of this tutorial is to give you a set of
example which demonstrate how you can download and use Chimera.
The tutorial is divided between two parts: Part 1 gives an example
of how download and run Chimera, Part 2 demonstrates some 
features of Chimera.  This tutorial will not provide examples on all of 
Chimera's features -- other documentation is available which discusses 
Chimera's features in more depth.
</p>

<H2> Part 1: Chimera Basics</H2>

<p>This first part of the tutorial is for all users of Chimera.  
The example below will show you the basics in how to
set up Chimera, run it, and then to run a client application which
will demonstrate creation of anchors, links, and a link traversal.

<H2>Part 2: Chimera Features</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
Chimera 2.0 has features which allow you create more complex hypermedia 
relationships than the simple link of the example in Part 1.  
In the second part of this tutorial you are given sets of examples 
which demonstrate some but not all of Chimera's features.  These 
examples build on each other so you may have to review the 
example in Part 1 in order to set up your system for 
 the examples.  
</p>

<H3>N-ary Links</H3>

<p> Chimera supports n-ary links.  An n-ary link means that your anchors 
can be grouped by links that can have as many anchors as you wish connected 
with them.  This is not the case with HTML where links are one-way.  
We believe that n-ary links will allow you to group related information
together there by aiding you in managing complex relationships between the
items you link together.
</p>

<p>
You may use Jimage to see an example of how to make an n-ary link.  This 
example will create an anchor on a new image, connect it to the link
you made with bill.gif and earthrise.gif in the previous 
example.  You will then traverse this link by using Jimage.

    </A>&nbsp;</LI>
</ul>

<H3>Hierarchical Webs</H3>

<p> Chimera 2.0 allows for hierarchical hyperwebs.  
In Chimera, the notion of a hyperweb is a grouping of hypermedia 
concepts which are related to each other.  These concepts are part
of Chimera's hypermedia model of the world.  For more information about 
Chimera concepts follow this link for 
<A HREF="../../overview/index.html">
a technical overview of Chimera concepts.
</A>
</p>

<p> The two examples below show how the hyperwebs, which are
organized hierarchically in Chimera can be used to form different 
contexts for the items you hook together and can be used to pass on 
information from one hyperweb to another.  
</p>


<H4> Switching contexts using Hyperwebs</H4>

<p> Switching from one Hyperweb to another changes the context of 
hypermedia relationships you have in them.
 The following example shows how this context
switching can be used.

    Making Anchors and Links on the new web.
    </A>&nbsp;</LI>
</ul>

<H4>Creating a Subweb and Inheriting Anchors and Link</H4>

<p> Chimera 2.0 allows you to pass on anchor and link information
to another web through the creation of subwebs.  When you create
a subweb of a web, the subweb inherits all the anchors and 
links of the parent web.  In this example, you will inherit the 
anchors and link from the previous example's flight_web.

    Adding an anchor to the inherited anchors and link.
    </A>&nbsp;</LI>
</ul>

<H3>Importing and Exporting between Websites</H3>

<p> You can import or export the Chimera databases of a Website through the
Import and Export functions found on the Hyperweb Server.  You may use 
these functions as means to store different states of your Chimera Website
through time.  Chimera 2.0 uses XML as the format for the files.

</ul>

<H3> Delayed Link traversal</H3>

<p>Chimera allows you to launch applications to complete Link traversals.
In order to to this, you must have a file configured in your home
directory.  This file indicates what program to launch for a specific
traversal event.  This file may be configured to suit your system.
