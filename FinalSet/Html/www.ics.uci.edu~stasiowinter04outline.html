				Fundamentals of Crypto Theory:
			</LI>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					One-way functions:&nbsp; This is the fundamental concept of&nbsp;functions 
					which are easy to compute but hard to invert.&nbsp; We will show&nbsp;how to 
					construct them from number theoretical assumptions. We will see 
					that&nbsp;one-wayness is necessary for many crypto objects, like encryption, 
					signature, key agreement.</LI>
				<LI>
					Hard-core bits:&nbsp; Just because some value is hard to compute, it doesn't 
					mean that all bits of that value are hard to compute.&nbsp; This is important, 
					because if you encrypt something, you need to know not just that the message is 
					hard to compute by the eavesdropper, but that every bit in the message is hard 
					to compute (because maybe the attacker cares about this one bit, which encodes 
					for example whether someone is depositing or withdrawing his money).&nbsp; We 
					show a fundamental result of cryptography that one-wayness implies hard-core 
					bits.</LI>
				<LI>
					Pseudorandom generators:&nbsp;the fundamental concept of pseudorandomness, its 
					applications, and constructions (from hard-core bits).</LI>
				<LI>
					Pseudorandom functions:&nbsp; Constructions (from pseudorandom generators), 
					applications.</LI></UL>
			<LI>
				Symmetric cryptography:&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;will break&nbsp;from the above chain 
				of&nbsp;increasingly more complex cryptographic objects, and&nbsp;we will map 
				these concepts to the world of symmetric cryptography.&nbsp; We 
				will&nbsp;substitute here a number-theoretical assumptions of hardness with 
				various assumptions on the basic building blocks of symmetric crypto, but we 
				will show that the same approach to the provably secure design applies 
				here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The topics will include:</LI>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					Construction of one-way permutation from one-way function</LI>
				<LI>
					Accumulation of "hardness" in rounds of block ciphers
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Cascade construction of pseudorandom functions</LI>
				<LI>
					Collision-resistance,&nbsp;construction of secure message message 
					authentication codes</LI>
				<LI>
					Construction of secure&nbsp;symmetric encryption</LI></UL>
			<LI>
				Assymetric cryptography:
			</LI>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					Signature schemes: definitions, constructions from general assumptions 
					(assuming one-way functions)</LI>
				<LI>
					Public key encryption: definitions, constructions</LI></UL>
			<LI>
				The so-called "Random Oracle Model" model for analysis of security:&nbsp; 
				Bridging the efficiency gap between&nbsp;assymetric and symmetric 
				cryptography:&nbsp;
			</LI>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					constructions (pseudorandom generators, pseudorandom functions, signatures, 
					encryption schemes)</LI>
				<LI>
					limitations (impossibility results)</LI></UL>
			<LI>
				Time permitting, in the few last lectures we will review some advanced topics:</LI>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					more efficient&nbsp;constructions (signatures, encryption, pseudorandom 
					functions), from&nbsp;stronger number theoretic assumptions (decisional 
					assumptions, strong RSA)</LI>
				<LI>
					zero-knowledge protocols</LI>
				<LI>
					commitment schemes</LI>
				<LI>
					multi-party computation
				</LI>
				<LI>
					composable security</LI>
				<LI>
					homomorphic encryption schemes</LI></UL>
