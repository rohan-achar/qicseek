<H2>CompSci 260 - Final Exam and the 260 Portion of the MS Comprehensive Exam - Winter, 2013 (Dillencourt)</H2>

<p>A department policy established in 2011 states that exams given
in core courses will also serve as MS Comprehensive exams.
Here is how this policy will be implemented in this offering of
CompSci 260.
</p>
<p>
The final exam will be given during finals week, at 
<A href="index.html#final">
the time stated on the class web page</A>.
This exam will also werve as the masters exam.
The criteria for passing the masters exam will be excellent or superior
performance on the final exam (in other words, at the level corresponding
to a grade of A- or higher.)
</p>
<p> <b>If you are enrolled in the course this quarter,</b> 
all you have to do is take the final exam.  No additional registration
for the masters exam is required</p>
<p><b>If you have taken CompSci 260 in a previous quarter
and want to take the 260 portion of the MS Comprehensive Exam this 
quarter,</b> you need to register for the Masters exam before February 1,
