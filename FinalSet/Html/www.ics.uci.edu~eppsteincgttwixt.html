<p>Rules of Twixt:</p>

<p>The board looks like this:</p>

<pre>
              BLACK
          . . . . . . . .
         +---------------+
        .|. . . . . . . .|.         .    = holes

        .|. . . . . . . .|.
        .|. . . . . . . .|.
         +---------------+
          . . . . . . . .    &lt;==== note that there are NO holes in the corners
              BLACK
</pre>

(The board is actually larger - 19x19 if I remember correctly) 

<p>Each player has an arbitrary number of towers (which fit into
the holes) and bridges which can connect two towers each. All
bridges have the same size.</p>

<p>Red starts , players take their turns alternately. When it's his
move, a player MUST place one tower into one hole. Red may NOT use
the holes behind black's borderlines and vice versa. After placing
a tower, a player may connect ANY number of towers as long as
possible. Towers may be connected, if they are a knight's move
apart (oh boy - excuse my English) i.e.:</p>

<pre>
    . o . o .       The center tower (x) may be connected to
    o . . . o       any of the towers marked '*'
    . . X . . 
    o . . . o 
    . o . o . 
</pre>

Two bridges may NOT cross each other regardless to which player
they belong. Bridges may NOT be removed once they have been placed.


<p>The first player who connect two holes behind his left &amp;
right (upper &amp; lower) borderlines by bridge wins the game.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in a game of Twixt per e-mail?</p>

<p>Regards,<br>

Not a draw at all! Look at this: 

<pre>
  . . O .    . . O .    . . O .    . . O .
  X ./. .    X ./X .    X ./X\.    X ./X\.

  . O . .    . O . .    . O . .    . O . .

X wins! You have to remember that bridges (or links) span a
knight's move.<br>
However -- 

<pre>
  O_  .   .   X
    --__     /
  .   X --O / .
     /     /  
  . / O_  X   .
   /    --__  
  X   .   . --O 
</pre>

this is a draw, but increase the size of the board by one more row
of holes on each side, and it isn't. (I luv ASCII !!!). With the
size of the Twixt boards, I think that the only draw comes from
running out pieces (I can't remember what happens when you run out
of pieces, do you recycle them or is it called a draw?)

The descriptions of Twixt posted so far have all been incomplete. A
move consists of 3 parts - 

<ol>
<li>Place a peg in any free hole,</li>

<li>Remove any of your own bridges,</li>

<li>Place bridges between any two of your own pegs which are a
knights move apart.</li>
</ol>

In parts 2 and 3 you may remove (add) any number of bridges. 

<p>Part 2 is the rule that is most often forgotten. Even in the
rule books accompanying some productions of the game it was
incorrectly ommitted. It is an important rule, since it often
resolves otherwise drawn positions. A good example is the mini
situation already posted</p>

<pre>
&gt;       . . O .    If X is connecting right to      . . O .
&gt;       X ./. .    left, he can play at x,          X ./. .

</pre>

In fact, with the help of this bridge removal rule, drawn games are
extremely rare in Twixt. 

<p>Twixt was invented by Alex Randolph, a prolific inventor of
games (see Sid Sackson's "Gamut of Games"), who introduced it to a
group of artist freinds who used to frequent a Vienese cafe. It has
been produced by several manufacturers, all of whom are required to
credit the inventor (what a good practice).</p>

<p>Twixt is, quite rightly, very highly regarded, and is rated as
one of the best modern board games around.</p>

<p>If you think that the concept of non-intersecting knight moves
is simple, try programming Twixt. Or try to find a non-intersecting
knight tour of 17 moves on a 6x6 board (with no square visited
twice). The unique solution can be found in Martin Gardner's
"Mathematical Circus".</p>

<p>Alternatively, try the following little game. The first player
marks a square on an 8x8 board. The second player draws a line from
this square to one a knights move away. The first player then draws
a line from this square to another a knights move away and so on,
each player extending a knights tour, which must be
non-intersecting, and no square may be visited more than once. The
last player able to move is the winner. This is an entertaining
little game, and one capable of being played with a high degree of
skill. I would be interested to hear of anyone who manages to
program this one.</p>

I had thought it was possible to remove bridges, too. I guess the

But not impossible! Consider the following situation, in which NO
bridges have been played, nor are any even immeediately playable!

A knight chain must alternate chessboard colors, and there is no
way to break through either player's monochromatic monopoly. So
neither player can win, even with the cooperation of her opponent.

</pre>

I don't think this rule will have the desired effect, because the
blockage usually happens while some other part of the board is
still technically open, but has a double-cross waiting. The
blockage would then be playable but the double-cross would
thereafter be forbidden! If both players had double-crosses
waiting, everyone could spring them except the last player, who
need not be the player who created the blockage in the first place.
I think the strategy starts to be something like Go's Ko wars. 

<p>I think it would be an extremely difficult rule to put into
practice, because after the blockage was established, you would
have to spend part of each turn demonstrating that your opponent
``could'' make a connection across the board, as long as you didn't
respond to the various double-crosses. Your strategy would then be
to form ever more double-crosses, while springing your opponent's.
The loser is the one who is forced to start throwing away moves
into uncontested parts of the board while the winner paves an
enforced right-of-way.</p>

From the Avalon Hill (Leisure Time) rules: "Before placing a peg, a
player may, if he desires, carefully remove any pegs and links he
has previously placed on the board." I.e., The order should be: 

<ol>
<li>Remove any of your own structure that you wish.</li>

<li>Place one peg.</li>

<li>Link any of your pegs that are a knight's move apart.</li>

This is very interesting. It is also apparently ignored in the

find a copyright date on the rules, much less an inventor's credit.


<p>The other games you mentioned also sound very interesting. I'll
try them out with some friends next weekend.</p>

<b>Subject:</b>        TWIXT rules, and some strategy
</pre>

<hr>
Hopefully this post will be the final word on the basic rules and
terminology questions about this game, so that we can get on to the
meatier strategy considerations. 

<p>Here are the rules as Avalon Hill printed them in the Leisure
Time Games version:</p>

<pre>
----------

HOW TO PLAY TWIXT (for two players)

1. Red plays first.  Players move alternately by placing _one_ peg at a
   time on the board.  Pegs may be placed by a player in any empty peg
   hole except those inhis opponent's border row.

2. When, after he has placed a peg, a player finds that he can _link_
   two or more of his pegs, he may place one or more links between these
   pegs to make a barrier.  Pegs may be linked only when the distance
   between them corresponds to the diagonal of a 6-holed rectangle.

   [ Diagrams "Twix--the basic linking move", "Eight possible linking
     directions from a given peg", "Double-Link (numbers indicate order
     of placement)" not included.  The Double-Link diagram shows how the
     third peg can be bridged to both the first and second pegs. ]

   A barrier cannot be crossed.  No barrier exists where a player could
   have linked but did not--whether the omission was intentional or
   unintentional.

   Before placing a peg, a player may, if he desires, carefully remove
   any pegs and links he has previously placed on the board.  However,
   he should be certain not to remove any pegs and/or links which would
   give the opponent the advantage.

3. To win, a player must connect his borders with an uninterrupted chain
   of linked pegs.  If neither player can complete such a barrier, the
   game is a draw.

HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE TWIXT (for four players)

Double TwixT is TwixT for four players in teams of two.  Rules are the
same as for TwixT, with the following qualifications:

1. Partners sit opposite one another.  Play alternates counterclockwise
   around the board.

2. No partner is limited to any one sector of the TwixT board: partners
   may play the two ends of a common barrier, or they may build
   independent sectors on any part of the board.  Partners may not
   communicate strategies to one another by any form of signalling.

3. Once, and only once in each game, on partner of either team may call
   out, "Privilege!" after making his own move.  On claim of Privilege,
   the opponent who would ordinarily move next must yield his turn to
   the other member of the "Privileged" team, giving the Privileged team
   two successive plays.

   The player to move next will be the partner of the opponent who
   yielded his turn.  If the opponents have not been defeated by the
   Privilege move, they may take their own Privilege at that point or
   later in the game.

   Privilege is invoked primarily for defensive reasons.  If this option
   is carefully planned by well-matched teams, it can make Double TwixT
   a fast, challenging game.

----------
</pre>

Me again. 

<p>Note 1. These rules ALLOW the removal of some of your structure
at the beginning of your move. The ramifications of this have
already been discussed in another thread on this newsgroup.</p>

<p>Note 2. The rules make no mention of play in the corners,
despite their existence in the AH board. A cutthroat variation is
to allow play in the opponent's border row, with a corner being a
legal border connection for either player.</p>

<p>Here is the basic strategy session from the AH rules:</p>

<pre>
----------

BASIC SETUPS

A setup is a planned pattern of pegging which permits the player to
double-link in either of two directions during the third move.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . *2. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2x . . . . . . . .
. . . ./.\. . . . . . _-*2. . . . . _-*2. . . . . . _-*-_ . . . . . . .
. . . o3. o3. . . .3o-./. . . . .3o-. .\. . . . .3o-_ . _-o3. . . . . .
. . . .\./x . . . x/_-o3. . . . . x\. _-o3. . . . . .-*-. . . . . . . .
. . . x *1. . . .1*-. x . . . . . .1*-x . . . . . . . x1. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

      Beam         Tilt            Coign            Mesh
    (3 holes,    (2 holes,       (diagonal        (1 hole,
    straight)    diagonal)       of 8-holed       straight)
                                 rectangle)

Pegs are numbered in order of placement.  In the third move (o) of any
setup, a player can both peg and double-link.

Generally, it is easier to concentrate on the placement of the second
peg, rather than the whole pattern.  If the second peg is placed the
correct distance from the first, the alternate locations for the third
peg will be obvious.

The most important part of the strategy of a setup is to avoid wasting a
move.  Do not place the third peg until your opponent moves to bar one
of your linking alternatives.  Instead, concentrate on building another
section of your barrier.

A setup can be foiled if the other player moves to block it immediately
after the first peg of the setup is placed.  Such foils are extensive;
some possibilities are indicated by x on the diagrams.  A well-placed
linking move is the simplest foil for a setup.

----------
</pre>

The AH rules also include a sample game on a reduced board which I
am not going to reproduce, except to note that the reduced board is
12x12 instead of 24x24, and does NOT show the existence of corner
holes. 

<p>Despite the game clearly not being as complex as GO, much of the
terminology of GO applies well to its strategy. The section above
covers the introduction to "connecting" and "making shape". Other
terms which have broad application across many abstract games, such
as "sente", also work here.</p>

<p>The Beam and the Tilt are the best setups for moving quickly
across the board, but can be attacked easily by the x moves shown,
among others. The Coign is much more solid, the only direct block
being a connection across the points marked x in that diagram. The
Mesh and the unmentioned "Anti-Tilt" (consider the o moves in the
Tilt diagram to be 1 and 2, followed by either of the * moves as
the double-link) are to be remembered as methods to connect pegs
that were originally placed as defensive or blocking moves.</p>

<p>Whereas the first three (which I call "long") are usually
attacked by building a barrier between pegs 1 and 2, the last two
("short") can be attacked effectively by blocking their possible
connections to the double-link spots _without_ actually separating
them with a barrier (this is the intention of the x moves on the
"mesh" diagram; a "beam" connection between the x's would smother a
possible connection on that side). In tight situations this attack
could be used against the long setups also.</p>

<p>The primary weakness of long setups is the inability to link
them end-to-end. In the situations below the moves x will quickly
lead to tight fighting and should be given consideration regardless
of the relation of x to the rest of your pegs, due to the
devastation they will cause in the opponent's barrier.</p>

  Beam Beam   Beam   Tilt  Tilt  Tilt  Coign Coign Coign Beam Coign
</pre>

A possible proverb: "Play inside the angle of linked setups". 

<p>The one exception to this rule is the linear Coign-Coign link,
which does not appear to have a single devastating countermove. I
have not completed this analysis, but it seems that a similar
result can be shown for short setups and for combinations, but is
complicated by the possibility of smothering attacks as well as
cuts.</p>

<p>The GO proverb "Do not touch what you are attacking" also
applies to Twixt, although in a different sense that is difficult
to define. If your opponent has a free end heading straight towards
her border it is already too late to try to set up just one barrier
to block her. You should skip at least 3 holes away ahead of her to
start setting up a more extensive wall. (This is the area that I am
very fuzzy in and will expect to see the most advances in, similar
to the development of chess openings or GO joseki.) Conversely, an
opponent who plays too closely to your free end is giving you a
gift by letting you either (a) choose which way to go around it
with a single-link move or (b) make move 2 of a setup on the other
side of her peg, forcing her to make the decision of which
double-link connection to block.</p>

                       RED

  RED  BLACK
1. G6             A solid opening move. By playing midway between the red
               borders, red is making black's task as difficult as possible.
1.      G8      On a larger board, this might be too close to the red peg,
               but black's game is already desperate. Black might have tried
               G10 instead, after which 2.E9,G4;3.E5(linking G6),D9;
               4.C8(linking E9),E11(G10,D9);5.B10(C8),D3;6.D2 (red wins) is
               one possible continuation.
2. C8            Red gets in black's face. Playing 4 holes away from your
               opponent's peg like this is frequently a good blocking move
               to make, particularly when the move is supported by a nearby
               peg as it is here.
2.      G4       Black follows the opening maxim: "Don't start a fistfight
                too soon." Simply playing E7 loses to 3.D6(C8),D5(E7);
                4.C4(D6) and red will win the race to the wall. Note that
                in this variation, red's G6 peg is not part of the final
                bridge. It's perfectly okay to abandon pegs this way.
                 Black might have played F4, after which one continuation is
               3.E5(G6),D5(F4);4.C6(E5) and red is unstoppable.
3.C4             The C4-C8 pegs form what is called a "setup," which means
               they threaten to link together in one move in two different
               ways. C4-G6 also threatens to link in one move, but they can
                only link via E5, so this is not a setup.
3.      B8     Black tries to make two threats at once. Now we're in the
              middle game (things move along quickly on a quarter board.)
4.E7          (linking G6,C8): the best move. Red covers both threats at
              once. If for example red had played D6(C4,C8) then
              4. ... D9(B8);5.G10,E7(G8,D9);6.H8(G6,G10),F6(G4,G8) and black
              has a win. Or if 4.E9(C8),D7(B8);5.E7(C8,G6),F6(G4,D7).
4.      D9    (linking B8): the only move, not that it matters.
5.G10         Now it's red's turn to make two threats at once.
5.      H6    (link G4,G8)  Black is just going through the motions.
6.F8          (link G10,G6) E9 was also possible.
6.     E4
7.D6(C4,C8),C3(E4);
8.B2(C4)             Black resigns.
</pre>

Here are some pithy aphorisms about the game: 

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the best offense is a good defense. See red's move #2
above. By falling back to block, red tries to have a "net" built by
the time black gets there.</li>

<li>In the opening, keep the whole board in mind. Don't get drawn
into a local battle if a distant move would help your position
more. Remember just because you put some pegs down doesn't mean
they have to be part of your final bridge.</li>

<li>Develop an eye for the "diagonals"- for example in the game
above, the line B2-C4-D6... was very important for red. In a "race"
such as in the analysis to black's 2nd move, being at least on such
a crucial diagonal means you will win the race to the wall.</li>
</ul>

HANDICAPS AND EQUALIZATION 

<p>As the above game demonstrates, red has a powerful initiative.
Between strong players of equal strength, this may mean that red
will win more often than not. Here's a ritual the players can go
through that is intended to equalize the game- make it more
balanced. On an otherwise empty board, one player puts down two red
pegs (which might be linked) and one black peg, producing a
position with black to move. The other player then decides which
side to play. Play then proceeds from this position. The red pegs
should be placed less than ideally (although not abysmally),
whereas black's peg is well placed, producing a position that is as
close to even as the "placer" can make it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is more likely that there will be a
considerable disparity between the players. In order to compensate,
here's a possible way to handicap the game: reduce the width of the
playing field, so that black (the weaker player) has less distance
to bridge than red. With an actual game set, this might be
accomplished with a black rubber band of the right size. A "half
board" game (12x24) is a pretty severe handicap. Reducing black's
distance from 24 to 23, on the other hand, just might serve to
balance out red's first-move initiative! I have no idea if this is
true. If it is, that would render my proposed "placer-chooser"
ritual unnecessary.</p>

<hr>
Greetings. 

<p>My name is David Bush. I'm a fanatic about Twixt. The search
engine 'Web Crawler' led me to your web site. I was pleased to see
past postings about Twixt given a (more or less) lasting home for
the curious to peruse. One of the postings (the annotated
quarter-board game) was mine, in fact.</p>

<p>However, despite the plethora of inputs regarding the correct
rules, there is one more rule that was left out: the "swap rule,"
Which Alex Randolph (the game's inventor) calls the "pie rule."
Jonathan Ferro's verbatim posting of the rules from an Avalon Hill
set were surely accurate; unfortunately, AH didn't quite get it
right either, ignoring the "pie rule." I have been in direct
correspondence with Mr. Randolph, and I assure you, the following
rules are correct:</p>

<p>The board is a 24x24 square grid of holes, MINUS THE CORNER
HOLES. (If the AH set has corner holes, then AH got that wrong as
well.) The rows along the edges are referred to as "border rows."
The 'top' and 'bottom' rows are Red's border rows. The 'left' and
'right' rows are Black's border rows. (European sets may use
different colors.) The board is empty at the start. Red moves
first. Each move in Twixt consists of three stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Place one peg of your color in any vacant hole EXCEPT in either
of your opponent's border rows.</li>

<li>Remove as many of your OWN links (which were placed on previous
moves) as you wish to remove.</li>

<li>Place as many legal links between pegs of your color as you
wish. A link may be placed ONLY between pegs which are at opposite
corners of a six-hole rectangle (like a knight's move in chess).
Your links may not cross any other link, not even one of your
own.</li>
</ol>

(Note there is no mention made of PEG removal. This is a minor
issue; supposedly, AH mentions peg removal in case you happen to be
running out of them. But with at least 40 pegs &amp; links for each
player, running out is extremely unlikely. There is no strategic
advantage that I can see in removing your own pegs.) 

<p>After Red places the first peg on the board, the second player
has the option of either responding normally as Black, or swapping
sides. If sides are swapped, the player who moved first as Red is
now Black, and makes the next move. Sides may be swapped only once
per game. If the second player does not swap immediately after the
Red places the first peg, sides may not be swapped at all that
game. (This is Alex Randolph's "pie rule," so named because it is
like "I cut the pie, you choose the slice." It is also called
one-move equalization, and can be adapted to balance many
two-player games.)</p>

<p>The object is to connect your border rows with an UNINTERRUPTED
chain of linked pegs. If neither side can complete such a chain,
the game is a draw.</p>

<p>The 3M and AH sets include rules for "double Twixt," as Mr.
Ferro described, but as far as I know, this is not Alex Randolph's
idea. It could be; I didn't ask him.</p>

<p>I also refer you to the website at <a href= 
"http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/#twixt">
www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/#twixt</a> for more info, including some
cool puzzles written by Randolph!</p>

<p>Now we're almost ready to talk about Twixt theory, but first, I
want to describe a notation system for making moves. The "European"
coordinate system is what I will use here.</p>

<p>The rows are lettered A to X, and the columns are numbered 1 to
24. Red has border rows at A and X. That is, the holes A2 ... A23
and X2 ... X23 are the Red border rows. Black's border rows are 1
and 24. That is, the holes B1 ... W1 and B24 ... W24 are the Black
border rows. Red's moves are numbered 1, 3, 5, ... Black's moves
are numbered 2, 4, 6, ...</p>

<p>Normally, a move is described by the coordinates where the peg
is placed. An asterisk is placed after these coordinates for each
link which is made to that peg. There should be precisely as many
asterisks as there are possible links to the peg just placed,
without removing any previous links. Since you always have the
option of removing your links later, most moves automatically
involve making all possible links to the peg just played.</p>

<p>Once in a rare while, however, you may have to remove some of
your links in order to avoid a draw (or even to avoid a loss.) Some
of the puzzle problems illustrate this theme. Here is a syntax for
describing all types of moves:</p>

<pre>
NOTE:  the bar | means "or."
       brackets [] mean "what is enclosed is optional."
</pre>

Each &lt;move&gt; is one of the following forms: 

<pre>
&lt;move&gt;       = &lt;simplemove&gt; | &lt;messymove&gt;

&lt;simplemove&gt; = &lt;coordinates&gt; &lt;asterisks&gt;

&lt;messymove&gt;  = &lt;coordinates&gt; [ - &lt;unlink list&gt; ] + [ &lt;link list&gt; ]

&lt;coordinates&gt;= &lt;letter A to X&gt; &lt;number 1 to 24&gt;

&lt;asterisks&gt;  = * [ &lt;asterisks&gt; ]
</pre>

Both types of &lt;list&gt; are of the form 

<pre>
  &lt;coordinates&gt; &lt;coordinates&gt; [ &lt;coordinates&gt; ... ][ , &lt;list&gt; ]
</pre>

Each string of coordinates in a list indicates a "chain" of pegs to
link or unlink. Commas are used as delimiters between each chain. 

<p>If you choose to make no links on your move, even though you
could link to the peg just played, this is indicated by the +
symbol with nothing after it.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a messy move. The diagrams need to be
viewed with a non-proportional font such as Courier.</p>

<p>Before move:</p>

<pre>
   3  4  5  6  7  8  9
 G .  O  .  # _O  O  .
       \  _---     \
 H .  .| O  .  O_ .| #    Only part of the board is shown here.
        \        ---\ 
 I .  .  O  . _#_ O  O    O to move.
        / _---   ---_ 
 J .  . |#  .  .  . _#
       /        _---  
 K .  O  .  .  #  .  .
</pre>

O makes the move I3-G4I5+H5I3K4,I5H7 

<pre>
   3  4  5  6  7  8  9
 G .  O  .  # _O  O  .
          _---     \
 H .  . _O  . _O_ .| #
    _---  _---   ---\ 
 I O  .  O  . _#_ O  O
    \   / _---   ---_ 
 J .| . |#  .  .  . _#
     \ /        _---  
 K .  O  .  .  #  .  .
</pre>

Okay! Now we can talk theory. Jon Ferro talks about "setups," using
terminology from the AH set: 

<pre>
&gt;BASIC SETUPS
&gt;
&gt;A setup is a planned pattern of pegging which permits the player to
&gt;double-link in either of two directions during the third move.
&gt;
&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
&gt;. . . . *2. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2x . . . . . . .
&gt;. . . ./.\. . . . . . _-*2. . . . . _-*2. . . . . . _-*-_ . . . . . .
&gt;. . . o3. o3. . . .3o-./. . . . .3o-. .\. . . . .3o-_ . _-o3. . . . .
&gt;. . . .\./x . . . x/_-o3. . . . . x\. _-o3. . . . . .-*-. . . . . . .
&gt;. . . x *1. . . .1*-. x . . . . . .1*-x . . . . . . . x1. . . . . . .
&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
&gt;
&gt;      Beam         Tilt            Coign            Mesh
&gt;    (3 holes,    (2 holes,       (diagonal        (1 hole,
&gt;    straight)    diagonal)       of 8-holed       straight)
&gt;                                 rectangle)
&gt;
&gt;Pegs are numbered in order of placement.  In the third move (o) of any
&gt;setup, a player can both peg and double-link.
</pre>

In the interest of completeness, it should be mentioned there is a
fifth setup type. Just as the 'mesh' is the converse of the 'beam,'
and the 'coign' is its own converse, there is a converse to the
'tilt' which AH does not mention. Modify the Tilt diagram so that
the 3 spots are labeled 1 and 2, and label the 1 and 2 spots as 3.
This setup doesn't get you very far, but can be extremely important
for close-up battles. 

<p>Talking about setups is a good way to begin to get a handle on
tactics, especially for understanding the concept of NOT WASTING
MOVES. Setups are usually unassailable, unless the opponent can
find a way to threaten the setup AND ANOTHER PART OF YOUR POTENTIAL
BRIDGE at the SAME TIME. Making two threats at once, or defending
two threats at once, is what you should strive to do on every move.
So, if your opponent is not threatening your setup, you usually
should not waste precious time linking it up!</p>

<p>The Beam setup is generally the one you should try for, if your
opponent allows you to make it. I have played many games against
newbies who allowed me to march right across the board this way. In
fact, the Beam is so strong, frequently the only way to block a peg
is to play in the same hole that your opponent would play in to
make a Beam.</p>

<p>There is a drawback to thinking strictly in terms of setups,
however. Setups are just a part of the arsenal of weapons availble
to you. From the very first move, you must PLAY THE WHOLE BOARD.
Here is an example of a possible opening between two experienced
players:</p>

<pre>
1.F7 (not swapped) 2.O10
3.M16              4.P16
5.R9               6.I16
7.I21              8.F19
</pre>

No links have been made so far. Instead, both players are spreading
their pegs around the board, attempting to make as many threats as
possible, while simultaneously dealing (hopefully) with the
opponent's threats. Only one setup has been made so far (Black's
I16-F19), and since neither of those pegs has a link leading away
from the setup, this setup is potentially vulnerable. But no local
situation should overly concern either player at this point. Both
sides should be prepared to abandon any pegs or links they have put
down, IF by doing so they can gain an OVERALL advantage. This is
where Twixt bears another similarity to Go, where a stone is not
necessarily placed in order to absolutely define the limits of a
player's territory, but instead might have a variety of purposes,
such as maintining the initiative (sente), or forcing a local
response and simultaneoulsy improving the position elsewhere on the
board. This long-distance effect is one of the most potent weapons
you can use in Twixt. I call this sort of move a "Zwischenzug,"
which is German for "intermediate move," and is a term commonly
used by chess players. See my annotated game #1 at the
above-mentioned website for examples of such moves. 

<p>As far as writing a Twixt-playing program is concerned, I
absolutely agree with the general consensus that this is not an
easy task. I have been trying to incorporate some of John Conway's
ideas in his book "Winning Ways," specifically his discussion of
temperature and cooling. I haven't been making much headway. I
suspect a good Twixt engine would have to have access to a very
large database of local positions before it would be able to "merge
the analysis" of several local positions into an overall board
strategy.</p>

<p>Torsten Sillke mentions an interesting problem, which I
interpret to be: is a given input position a draw, or is it still
possible for one side to complete a bridge? This might actually be
a feature you would like a Twixt server to have, so that the
machine can tell you if the position is a draw or not. In practice,
however, if two players are strong enough to achieve a draw, they
would recognize the game was drawn long before all possible paths
are actually blocked.</p>

<p>Well, enough blathering. Thanks for your time and patience!</p>
