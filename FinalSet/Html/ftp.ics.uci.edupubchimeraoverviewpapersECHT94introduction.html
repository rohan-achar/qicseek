<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
Software development environments (SDEs) are used to develop and maintain a diverse collection of highly interrelated software objects [2, 8,20, 35]. Large software systems may, for example, consist of multiple versions of requirements specifications, designs, prototypes, code, test information, scripts, documentation, and so on. The connections between these components are many and complex. Establishing and exploring these connections are major tasks of development, program understanding, and maintenance. Researchers have recognized that the size, complexity, and interconnectedness of these systems place a severe cognitive load on software engineers which often leads to errors at high levels of system abstraction, such as requirements and design [1, 17].<p>

It has been suggested that the attributes of hypertext make it an excellent technology for capturing and visualizing relations in a SDE [7]. Providing hypertext capabilities in a SDE allows an engineer to freely associate objects without regard to the type of those objects or where they are stored. These relationships can then be accessed at a later time through a convenient user interface which allows the engineer to easily navigate them [30]<A HREF="footnotes.html#Footnote1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. Yet while some excellent work has taken place in this area [3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 22, 24, 28, 29, 31], it is clear that no single system to date has effectively addressed all the technical challenges posed by this task.<p>

We believe that the following technical features are among those which need to be present in hypertext systems intended to support SDE activities<A HREF="footnotes.html#Footnote2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.<p>

<B>Heterogeneous object editor & viewer support. </B>SDEs contain a wide variety of tools for developing and manipulating objects. Different kinds of editors are used for different types of objects. SDEs also increasingly include multiple viewers of single objects, where each viewer presents different aspects of the object, perhaps using different depiction styles. It is unlikely that software development teams will give up their favorite tools in exchange for hypertext functionality. Thus a monolithic approach to providing hypertext services to a SDE would be ineffective. Ideally all editors and viewers<A HREF="footnotes.html#Footnote3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> in an environment should be able to use hypertext services and respond to hypertext events.<p>

<B>Anchors specialized to particular views. </B>Given that different viewers of a single object may present strikingly different depictions, or that one viewer may present a depiction of information synthesized from several separate objects, anchors seem more naturally--or necessarily--associated with views, rather than objects.<p>

<B>Multiple-view, concurrent, and active displays. </B>Since a software developer is typically engaged in examining and changing many different related objects "at once" it is most supportive to provide a system which enables many views to be present simultaneously, where several views may be of the same object, and where actions in views may be autonomous and concurrent.<p>

<B>Links across heterogeneous object managers. </B>SDEs manage such a wide variety of objects, of different legacies, types, and possessing different object management constraints, that large scale SDEs are now beginning to support multiple, heterogeneous object managers. It is nonetheless essential to be able to establish links between objects managed by different repositories.<p>

<B>Action specifications on both anchors and links. </B>Given that many different users, of different abilities and training, may be collaborating on a project using a SDE, it seems useful to provide programmable actions on both anchors and links so that actions could, for example, be determined as a function of who selected an anchor in a particular view, or how a particular link traversal was requested.<p>

<B>Scalable (composable) links. </B>Hierarchy and abstraction are two key tools that engineers employ in undertaking large--scale problems. Hypertext support for SDEs must similarly provide such capabilities for dealing with large, complex, aggregations of information.<p>

<B><I>n</I>-ary links. </B>Software development often involves situations where several pieces of information jointly represent a single concept or are in some sense "grouped." We claim therefore that hypertext support for SDE applications should provide such capabilities in the form of <I>n</I>-ary links.<p>

<B>Multiple contexts. </B>The process of software development involves many stages (often including cycles) where different types of information are more important than others. Often software team members have many different roles both between and within these different stages. As such, hypertext support for SDEs should be able to take into account the current stage of the software development process and enable engineers to quickly access critical information.<p>

This paper describes a set of concepts which satisfy this set of requirements, and a prototype which implements the described concepts. The notion of viewers of objects is at the heart of the conceptualization. We postulate an environment of many types of objects; display or editing of an object requires use of a viewer. Not all viewers are of the same type; how they manage their display is their decision. We have developed a set of interfaces whereby a viewer announces to the hypertext system the anchors it defines for its view of its object(s). These view-specific anchors can then participate in (many) links. Links may be considered objects in their own right, and may thus have viewers associated with them which can define yet additional anchors. These anchors can participate in other links, and in so doing provide hierarchical composition.<p>

This approach brings along with it some limitations and requirements. In order for our techniques and interfaces to be of value, the viewers in the SDE must be programmed to utilize the hypertext system's application program interface (API).  The viewers are also responsible for maintaining (over time) the associations they make between the anchors they announce to the hypertext system and the objects or process artifacts (e.g. a button in a window) that they display in their views.<p>

Since heterogeneous environments are most often multilingual and distributed, the generic architecture and our implementation is client-server based and a multilingual remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism (Q [23]) is utilized. Our prototype implementation, Chimera<A HREF="footnotes.html#Footnote4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>, utilizes the Pleiades object management system from the University of Massachusetts [32] for persistence of the server's data structures. To illustrate the concepts and the Chimera system, we discuss an application in which graphical views of a flight simulator's instrument panel are hyperlinked to statements in a requirements document maintained by FrameMaker<SUP>&reg;</SUP><A HREF="footnotes.html#Footnote5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>. The Chiron user interface development and management system (Chiron) from the University of California, Irvine [33, 34] is used as the graphical viewer of the instrument panel.<p>

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next four sections present the basic concepts, the conceptual architecture, our particular implementation, and our future plans.  We then discuss related work and conclude.
