    <p>Researchers from the Center for Emergency Response Technologies (CERT) at UC Irvine are hosting a one day workshop on Emergency Information
    Dissemination in Schools to be held on the UC Irvine campus.  We would like to invite you to participate in the workshop and provide us with your
    perspective on interesting and important issues in enabling fast and effective crisis information dissemination to the very diverse K-12 community
    in our state and nation.</p>

	<p>CERT (www.cert.ics.uci.edu) was established to expand on the successes of the 5-year RESCUE-ITR program (www.itr-rescue.org) which concludes this year.
	Our highly interdisciplinary research team (with computer scientists, engineers, social scientists and disaster science experts) believes that
	providing timely and accurate information can significantly enhance the decision making abilities of response organizations and the public at large.
	We are working closely with our government and industrial partners to design and deliver next generation emergency management solutions that improve
	information flow in crisis response networks.</p>

	<p>In this workshop we aim bring together school, city, county and state representatives and discuss the current processes, systems and challenges in
	disseminating emergency warnings and alerts in schools.  Moreover, we would like to evaluate the extent to which recent and upcoming information
	and communication technologies can be customized to help the dissemination process in our schools to achieve the desired level of response.</p>

	<p>We have two main goals for this meeting:
		<ol>
	   		<li>To collect information about existing warning systems, processes, procedures for emergency  warnings  and alerts to schools that span
	   		different communities, populations and socioeconomic categories</li>
	   		<li>To envision the design of the next generation of technologies and processes to help educational institutions better prepare for disasters
	   		and effectively respond in real-time to emergencies.</li>
	   	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>As an outcome of this workshop we plan to move forward in the development of a short notice warning system (effective in  the case of earthquakes,
	tornadoes, fires and flash floods) and specifically customize them for the school scenario.  A longer term goal would be to explore the opportunity
	to engage our K-12 community to participate in pilot studies for testing these processes and systems.</p>
