<H2>VLSI Design</H2>

VLSI circuit design involves many levels of abstraction; the most
geometric of these is the physical design level, in which circuits are
represented as (typically) collections of rectangles representing layers
of various materials on a chip.  Most of the layout, routing, and verification
problems at this level involve some amount of computational geometry.
At another level of abstraction, simulation of the electronic and
physical properties of a chip involves interesting questions of <A

advantage to be taken from the fact that the geometry is rectilinear and
planar or nearly planar.

John Hershberger describes some geometric problems arising in his work
at Mentor graphics including interpolation of thermal data, minimum spanning trees, and breakout
routing in PC board design.

Berkeley.  The basic idea is to solve various "advancing front" type problems
such as finding shortest paths around obstacles, by evolving a surface
in one higher dimension that describes the dynamics of the front.

VLSI design, medical image processing, noise removal from images, and
robot motion planning.
