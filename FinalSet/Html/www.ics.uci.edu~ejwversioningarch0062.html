Jim divided up the Web versioning world into browsing/authoring issues.
I see three, and they all happen via HTTP.

1)      GET -- browsing versioned entities.

2)      PUT -- "checking in" a newly authored version of an entity.

3)      VC -- doing all the ancilliary configuration management activities.

I'm going to wade in again and offer some opinion.

GET.

    It seems critical to me that we support what Jim called "browsing
    within a collection of entities" and that we do so with without
    requiring version-aware clients.  Why?  Because delivering versioned
    content will be the most important product of our efforts, and our
    plans can't rely on changing Netscape.

    Of the various URL decoration proposals, only one satisfies this
    dual requirement: having the version indicator embedded in the URL,
    separated off by /'s.  With this, we can reuse the support already
    in Web clients for handling relative URLs.

    As Fabio discussed, and I wholeheartedly agree with, the hierarchical
    path component of a URL is well suited to accomodating version
    information.  This is because, I believe, an entity's version is
    just another component of its name, albeit a component that locates
    the entity in time rather than in (filesystem) space.

    The only other possible solution, which is poor, is to have
    version-aware servers support non version-aware clients by editing
    the returned HTML on the fly, fixing up links with version info.
    If anyone supports this solution, I'd like to hear it.

PUT.

    "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." My
    personal feeling is many lives will be lost to this effort.
    Nonetheless, I think it is inevitable that it will be done.

    The significance of the PUT operation is that the Web plays the role
    of a client/server configuration management system, with HTTP being
    the client/server protocol.  Of course, in most cases the Web server
    is just making use of an existing software configuration management
    (SCM) system.

    Having written a full-bore SCM system from scratch, and being familiar
    with a dozen others, I can tell you that supporting the union of
    all SCM practices and architectures will be, uh, difficult.  The
    major differences is not whether they require locked head revisions
    but rather how well their architecture fits in with the Web's
    client/server model.

    To wit:

    1)  SCM systems such as CVS rely on state information, stored
        on the client, to know what version of what documents are
        being edited (and thus what will be "put" back).  CVS's
        state information is fairly trivial, and could be embedded
        into the HTML documents being edited.  But that doesn't work
        so well if the entities aren't HTML.  When the user PUTs a
        GIF, how will a version-aware Web server based on CVS recover
        the state necessary to check the GIF in?

        SCM systems that store the state in the server, such as
        ClearCase, don't have this same problem, I think.  But make
        no mistake about it: these version-aware Web servers are
        quite stateful.

    2)  Other SCM systems have fairly heavyweight client
        implementations themselves, with a fat protocol between the
        client and server.  For example, it is unlikely that a
        version-aware Web client would be able to carry out all the
        machinations necessary to be a ClearCase view (i.e. a client).

        The only solution I see to this is to have the Web server
        maintain private client workspaces on behalf its own clients,
        and act as a proxy to those clients.  Playing out the
        ClearCase example, the Web server would have a view for each
        of the Web clients who will PUT documents.

    3)  The picture is even less rosy with SCM systems that require
        the client to have direct file access to the repository.  A
        large chunk of the commercial SCM systems -- PVCS, MKS Source
        Integrity, Continuus, Microsoft's SourceSafe -- are in this
        boat.  I can't see any way they can be backend to a version-aware
        Web server without the Web server having to act as proxy to
        client workspaces maintained on the server.

        Maybe David Fiander can say what MKS does to support this.
        There must be a decent solution in there somewhere.

    4)  Aside from architecture, the model varies wildly from one SCM
        system to the next.  And as has been discussed, the lock-the-head
        vs merge-into-trunk vs change-set models all need to be
        accomodated.

        Going further, something that we (P3) support is atomic checkin
        of multiple documents, because it allows you to move the repository
        forward in whole chunks rather than a file-at-a-time.  Certainly
        we think this is important for Web documents as well, and would
        like to see multiple PUTs with a single COMMIT possible.

Version control.

    All the wrinkles that make a simple PUT difficult are going to make
    flowing full version control models over HTTP truly daunting.
    It might be possible to come up with a limited set of operations that
    make sense across all models, but the examples put forth so far --
    compute the predecessor revision and show a version tree -- each only
    make sense in a subset of the systems.

My flame-retardant personal opinion is that supporting GETs is well
within the ability of this group, that PUTs will get mired for long
enough that some defacto industry implementation will set the lead and
thus simplify the range of models that need supporting, and that the
rest of version control via HTTP will follow after that.  But I welcome
contrary opinions, because in this case I'd be glad to be wrong.
