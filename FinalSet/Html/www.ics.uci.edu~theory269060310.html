<h1>Strip Packing with Precedence Constraints and Release Times</h1>

<h2>Authored by: John Augustine, Sudarshan Banerjee, Sandy Irani</h2>

Abstract:
<p>
This paper examines two variants of strip packing: when the rectangles 
to be placed have precedence constraints and when the rectangles have
release times. Strip packing can be used to model
scheduling problems in which  tasks require a contiguous
subset of identical resources that are arranged in a linear topology.
The particular variants  studied here are motivated by 
scheduling tasks for dynamically reconfigurable 
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). For the case in which
tasks have precedence constraints, we give an <I>O</I>(log <I>n</I>)
approximation, where <I>n</I> is the number of tasks.
We also give a 3-approximation for the special case in which
all the rectangles to be placed have uniform height.
For release times, we provide an asymptotic polynomial time 
(1+&epsilon;)-approximation scheme. We make the standard assumption 
that the rectangles have height at most 1. In addition, we also 
require widths to be in (&epsilon<sub><I>n</I></sub>, 1]. Our algorithm runs in time 
polynomial in <I>n</I>, 1/&epsilon;, and 1/&epsilon<sub><I>n</I></sub>.
