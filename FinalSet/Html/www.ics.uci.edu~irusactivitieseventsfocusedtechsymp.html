<h1>Focused Technology Symposia</h1>
 
The purpose of our periodic focused technology symposia is to bring
together researchers and practitioners for a day of information sharing 
on a particular topic. Participation from the local community in the form 
of presentations on new approaches, positive and negative experience reports, 
and panel discussions is highlighted. Abstracts may be solicited and 
reviewed by IRUS faculty. A typical program consists of presentations, 
panels, and invited speakers.
<p>
Focused technology symposia have been held on the topics of the World
Wide Web and Internet, Reuse-based Software Engineering, Software Process, 
Software Safety, and Ada issues. Topics under consideration for future 
symposia include computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), software 
architecture, analysis and testing, and formal methods.
