<p>
Shors algorithm for factoring in polynomial time on a quantum 
computer gives an enormous advantage over all known classical 
factoring algorithm. We demonstrate how to factor products of large 
prime numbers using a compiled version of Shors quantum factoring 
algorithm. Our technique can factor all products of p, q such that 
p, q are unequal primes greater than two, runs in constant time, and 
requires only two coherent qubits. This illustrates that the correct 
measure of difficulty when implementing Shors algorithm is not 
the size of number factored, but the length of the period found.
