Authenticated Data Structures for Graph and Geometric Searching
</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ltrott/">Lowell Trott</a></h2>
<p>
Authenticated data structures provide cryptographic proofs that their
answers are as accurate as the author intended, even if the data
structure is maintained by a remote host. We present techniques for
authenticating data structures that represent graphs and collections of
geometric objects. In our model, a data structure maintained by a
trusted source is mirrored at distributed directories that answer
queries and provide proof of correctness. Our work has applications to
the authentication of network management systems and geographic
information systems.
