<FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>im has been performing research as a Ph.D. student
in Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine,
as part of the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/atUCI.html"> Arcadia</A>
consortium. Jim's research lies in five areas:

    Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web
  <LI>
    Versioning and Configuration Management of Hypermedia
  <LI>
    Open Hypermedia Systems

  Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web
</H3>
<P>
The World Wide Web was originally conceived as an interactive, read/write
medium, and it is only the early dominance of the Mosaic browser which cast
the Web into its current publish/browse paradigm. &nbsp;While the HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1) contains limited support for remote authoring
in addition to remote browsing of content, this support is not sufficient
for collaborative authoring of web content. &nbsp;Jim is the Chair of the
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</A>
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/">World Wide Web Distributed
Authoring and Versioning (WEBDAV)</A> Working Group, which is developing
interoperability specifications for how to perform remote authoring and
versioning of web content.

<P>
The distributed authoring and versioning working group has held
many meetings.  For a complete list of meetings, their minutes,
and presentations given at the meetings, consult the

  Versioning and Configuration Management of Hypermedia
</H3>
<P>
The promise that hypermedia technology holds for allowing software developers
to capture the relationships between the software documents they produce
(requirements, design, source code, test cases, etc.) and easily browse through
their project information space will only be realized once hypermedia systems
can support versioned links among versioned artifacts, which can be meaningfully
grouped into configurations. Providing this support has been the goal of
Jim's research into versioning and configuration management of hypermedia.
<P>
Jim was a participant in the first Workshop on Versioning in Hypertext Systems,
held at ECHT'94 where he presented a proposal for adding versioning support
to the Chimera open hypermedia system. He was also a member of the panel,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/panel/wkshop_summary.html">
"Things Change: Deal with It! Versioning, Cooperative Editing, and Hypertext,"</A>
at Hypertext'96. Jim additionally discussed issues of hypertext versioning
and configuration management as a participant at the
<A HREF="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/is/SCM6.html"> Sixth
International Workshop on Software Configuration Management</A>, held before
the 18th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE18), held
March 25-26, 1996, in Berlin, Germany.
<P>
Versioning and configuration management are important issues for the World
Wide Web. To ensure the future web provides good support in this area, in
May, 1996, Jim gathered representatives from software configuration management
firms, document management companies, WWW researchers, hypertext versioning
researchers, and HTTP server authors together to form the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/"> Working Group on Versioning
and Configuration Management of World Wide Web Content</A>. This group was
subsumed by the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/">Working
Group on Distributed Authoring and Versioning on the World Wide Web
(webdav)</A> in early September, 1996.

<P>
The topic of managing WWW content was the subject of a talk which Jim,
along with Martin Cagan (then at Continuus Software, now at Netscape),
gave at the symposium "Wired: The Internet and the World Wide Web"
(May, 1996), sponsored by the Irvine Research
Unit in Software (<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/">IRUS</A>), titled
<A HREF="ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/ejw/www_content.ps"> WWW Content Management:
Emerging Problems, Emerging Solutions</A>. This talk was also presented at
the Bay Area Roundtable
(<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/bart.html">BART</A>) in May, 1996.

  Open Hypermedia Systems
</H3>
<P>
Before focusing on the versioning aspects of open hypermedia, Jim worked
with Ken Anderson and Prof. Dick Taylor on the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/chimera/">Chimera</A>
open hypermedia system. Chimera provides hypermedia infrastructure for use
within a software development environment. Due to its openness, Chimera can
provide hypermedia functionality within existing tools such as vi, FrameMaker,
an MPEG player, etc. Jim's research on the Chimera project has focused on
these client application integrations with the Chimera system. As a thought
experiment, Jim also considered an integration of Chimera with the WWW.

  Software Architecture
</H3>
<P>
Motivated by the vision of creating a marketplace of software components
which could be quickly assembled into larger systems, Jim worked on the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/C2/c2.html"> Chiron-2</A> software
architectural style research project. As part of a team working on this project,
Jim defined the aspects of an architecture which contribute to its ability
to be a components marketplace, worked on an early version of the notation
used to formally describe a Chiron-2 architecture, helped define the capabilities
of the Chiron-2 design environment, worked on the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/C2/klax.ps"> Klax example</A>, and
provided in-depth critiques of important aspects of the Chiron-2 architectural
style.

  Software Development Environments
</H3>
<P>
While Jim's work in hypermedia is directly applicable to software development
environments, Jim has also performed some research on software development
environments in general. In May, 1993, Jim participated in the Software
Environments Technical Research Review, sponsored by the Irvine Research
Unit in Software (IRUS), in which industry and academic representatives met
to perform a research review on the topic of software environments. Jim helped
write up a report on this meeting, and presented its results to the 4th Irvine
Software Symposium.
