    <h1><span>Wolfram's Classification of Cellular Automata</span></h1>

    <p><span>In his influential paper "University and Complexity in
    Cellular Automata" <small>[Physica D 10 (1984) 1-35; all page
    numbers refer to the reprint in <i>Cellular Automata and
    Complexity</i>, Addison-Wesley 1994, pp. 115-157]</small>,
    Stephen Wolfram proposed a classification of cellular automaton
    rules into four types, according to the results of evolving the
    system from a "disordered" initial state:</span></p>

    <ol>
      <li><span>Evolution leads to a homogeneous state.</span></li>

      <li><span>Evolution leads to a set of separated simple stable
      or periodic structures.</span></li>

      <li><span>Evolution leads to a chaotic pattern.</span></li>

      <li><span>Evolution leads to complex localized structures,
      sometimes long-lived.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <p><span>This classification was initially only for
    one-dimensional cellular automata, but in "Two-Dimensional
    Cellular Automata" <small>[with N. H. Packard, J. Stat. Phys.
    38 (1985) 901-946, reprinted in <i>Cellular Automata and
    Complexity</i> pp. 211-249]</small> he extended it to
    two-dimensional automata.</span></p>

    <p><span>Intuitively, according to this classification, one
    should only expect gliders, Turing-universality, and similar
    complex behavior in class 4 automata. Indeed, after discussing
    the existence of glider-like structures in a class 4 automaton,
    and their resemblance to structures in Conway's Life, Wolfram
    writes <small>[p.151]</small> "These analogies lead to the
    speculation that class 4 automata are characterized by the
    capability for universal computation."</span></p>

    <p><span>However, there is a major flaw in this reasoning:
    because the classification is based on evolution from an
    unordered state, there is little reason for it to characterize
    behavior on initially ordered states. Our investigation has
    turned up gliders in systems that would likely be classified in
    each of the four classes: e.g. (<a href="lifelike.html">in
    standard semitotalistic rule notation</a>) <a href= 
    "http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b367s3678/">B367/S3678</a>
    (class 1), <a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3s256/">
    B3/S256</a> or <a href=
    "http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3s234/">B3/S234</a> (both
    class 2 although having very different behavior), <a href= 
    "http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b345678s12468/">
    B345678/S12468</a> (class 3), and <a href= 
    "http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3s23/">B3/S23</a> (class 4).
    This result throws the usefulness of this classification system
    into question.</span></p>

    <p><span>The existence of a glider should automatically place a
    system into class 4, since such a complex localized structure
    would also arise from sufficiently large disordered initial
    conditions, however "sufficiently large" may be so huge that
    one can not in practice discover such structures by chance.
    Wolfram's classification may then be worse than useless: it may
    be ill-defined, since there is no quick test for distinguishing
    class 4 rules from other rules.</span></p>

    <p><span>In "Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata", Wolfram
    mentions a number of particular rules. How do they stack up in
    terms of his classification and the existence of
    gliders?</span></p>

    <p><span>(When I could find a classification in Wolfram's
    paper, I listed it above; otherwise the "Classification" column
    is blank.)</span></p>

    <p><span>A simpler classification scheme explains the data
    better than Wolfram's:</span></p>

    <ul>
      <li><span><b>Contraction impossible.</b> If a rule includes B1,
      any pattern expands to
      infinity in all directions, no gliders can exist, and the
      question of whether a pattern lives or dies can not be
      universal. Similarly, if a rule (such as <a href= 
      "http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b378s012345678/">
      B378/S012345678</a> above) includes S01234, or includes
      B23/S0, the bounding box of a pattern can never shrink, and
      no pattern can die or move. However, <a href= 
      "http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=Ho8LoF.49H@bath.ac.uk">
      as Tim Tyler has pointed out</a>, universal computation could
      still occur in other ways; for instance the boundary of an
      expanding pattern could simulate the behavior of a 1d
      universal automaton.</span></li>

      <li><span><b>Expansion impossible.</b> If a
      rule does not include B2 or B3, any pattern remains within
      its initial bounding box, no gliders can exist, and again the
      question of whether a pattern lives or dies is not universal
      (it can be solved in at most exponential time). Some rules
      with B3 (such as <a href= 
      "http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b345s5/">B345/S5</a>,
      "longlife") appear to exhibit similar behavior of remaining
      inside a region bounded by the dimensions of the original
      pattern.</span></li>

      <li><span><b>Both expansion and contraction possible.</b>
      Only in the remaining cases can gliders exist. Our
      investigations show that a large fraction of the remaining
      cases do indeed support gliders; much more work would be
      required to show that they are universal.</span></li>
