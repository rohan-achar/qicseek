      with a brief statement about each including a link
      to the item.
   <li> Five questions that you could not have answered at the
      start of this quarter, that you can answer now along with
      the answers.  Each answer should be at least 80 words long
      and contain at least 2 links to other documents on the Web.
      At least 2 of these 5 questions should be directly related
      to the content of this course and at least 2 others should
      be directly related to your major or (if you are unaffiliated)
      an academic area you are considering as your major.
