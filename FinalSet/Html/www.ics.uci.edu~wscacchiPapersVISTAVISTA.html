<h2> Abstract</h2>
</center>
In this paper, we describe a radically new approach for the acquisition
of software-intensive systems. We start by reviewing problems and
opportunities for improving the acquisition of these systems. We put
forward a statement of objective on the need to make the software
system acquisition more agile and adaptive, through the evolutionary
modeling, simulation, and development of the system being acquired. We
describe a new vision for the re-tooling and re-engineering software
system acquisition into a form we call, <i>VISTA</i> , denoting an
approach to the virtual acquisition of these systems. We then outline
the VISTA approach to software acquisition. This is followed by a
discussion of the technical and organizational transitions that must be
investigated and managed to ensure the eventual success of such a
radical change to software system acquisition. <br>

<h2> <a name="Problems"></a>Problems and Opportunities for Improving
Acquisition</h2>
The acquisition of major software-intensive systems is often
problematic. Recent reports from the US General Accounting Office
(E.g., GAO 1995, GAO 1997) describe a number of problems with the way
complex systems are acquired. The current problems in their
acquisition include:
<ul>
  <li> difficulty in establishing viable and cost-effective system
requirements</li>
  <li> overly optimistic cost, schedule, and performance estimates</li>
  <li> concurrent development and production of systems</li>
  <li> commitment to system production before adequate demonstration or
testing that determines system viability is completed.</li>
</ul>
To no surprise, modern and future weapon systems increasingly represent
software-intensive systems. In addition, DoD and other government
agencies rely on the acquisition and use of computer-based information
systems to manage their recurring organizational and operational
activities. Many of these management information systems are often
running on out-dated computing platforms that must be replaced or
modernized.
<p>DoD has established acquisition strategies that move it toward
commercial acquisition practices. One strategy embodies the idea that
the feasibility and ability to produce advanced technologies can often
be demonstrated before they are incorporated into acquisition programs.
For example, the use of advanced concept technology demonstrations can
more directly involve war fighters/users in demonstrating the
operational feasibility of new technologies and concepts before
commitments are made to full-scale acquisition. Another strategy rooted
in the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA)
establishes benchmarks for a more professional acquisition workforce
with defined training and education requirements, and acquisition
career paths. The goal of this act is to provide an acquisition
workforce that is more responsible for improving program costs and
schedule estimates. Finally, in 1994 OSD began pursuing a strategy to
re-engineer the systems acquisition review process. This includes an
effort to reduce acquisition costs (including overhead costs) through
the adoption of business processes characteristic of world-class
commercial buyers and suppliers. </p>
<p>The overall way in which the federal government conducts its
acquisition practices has been reviewed and redesigned in response to
the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994. Among other
things, the FASA requires incentives and a performance-based approach
to managing acquisition programs. This emphasizes streamlining the
acquisition process and proposes greater reliance on commercial
products and processes. Also, concepts for applying commercial practices
to DoD software system acquisition have been addressed in Defense
Science Board reports. </p>
<p>Thus, we are at a time when there is substantial opportunity to
rethink how the acquisition of software-intensive systems should occur
to address the recurring problems. At the same time, we should pursue
new opportunities to re-engineer the systems acquisition process&nbsp;
that can realize savings, efficiencies, increased satisfaction, and
continuous improvement. Similarly, we should provide a strategy for
managing the transition to these re-engineered system acquisition
processes, as they can represent a radical departure from current
practices. Subsequently, we seek to explore how these opportunities
can be pursued through use of advanced information processing tools,
techniques and concepts. Our objective is to make the acquisition of
software-intensive systems more agile and adaptive. Relevant
information technologies include those for: (1) re-tooling system
acquisition processes to better assess the feasibility of system
acquisitions; (2) digital libraries for organizing and sharing
information gathered during system acquisitions and program management;
and (3) Internet-based electronic commerce services and capabilities for
streamlining procurement actions, lead times, and supply chain logistics
(cf. Nissen 1997, Scacchi 1997). However, in this paper and in related
materials (Boehm and Scacchi 1996), we focus our discussion to the
first of these areas. </p>
<h3></h3>
<h2> <a name="Agile"></a>Steps toward more agile acquisition of future
systems</h2>
In general terms, our overall goal is to address the recurring problems
that plague system acquisition efforts. Our approach suggests&nbsp;
ways in which new modeling and simulation techniques can help in
re-engineering how software-intensive systems are acquired by the DoD
and other government agencies. This means that we seek to identify new
concepts, tools, and techniques for acquiring software-intensive
systems that fulfill four goals: First, to establish viable and
cost-effective system requirements. Second, to establish realistic
cost, schedule, and performance estimates. Third, to mitigate against
concurrent development and production of systems. Fourth, to enable
adequate demonstration and testing of system viability before a
commitment to system production must be made. Based on the results from
a series of workshops and Blue Ribbon Panels of leading military,
industry, and academic experts that addressed the problems of&nbsp;
large-scale software system acquisition (Boehm and Scacchi, 1996), we
can identify five issues involved in achieving and transitioning to the
overall goal:
<p><i>We need to first baseline our current understanding of strengths
and weaknesses of current "as-is" process capabilities for acquiring
software-intensive systems.</i> Guidelines, best practices, and lessons
learned are being collected and disseminated. The Software Technology
Support Center (STSC 1995) and the Software Program Managers Network
(SPMN 1997) have assembled recent collections. Nonetheless, we also
need to understand how they are employed; as well as identify the
operational problems which may inhibit their application and success. </p>
<p><i>We need to develop scenarios for new "to-be" acquisition process
capabilities that exploit an evolutionary "virtual" approach to the
acquisition of software-intensive systems.</i> Such an approach
emphasizes <i>the incremental acquisition of virtual prototypes for a
new software-intensive system</i>. These prototypes start as models of
the intended system. These system models can be analyzed and simulated
to determine which system requirements and risks have been addressed.
As familiarity and confidence with the prototypes' increases, their
realism and functionality increases with the incremental integration of
system components. In this way, virtual prototypes of systems can be
incrementally modeled and iteratively reconfigured with simulated or
actual subsystem components. The development and production of a
growing number of complex Electro-mechanical assemblies are now
designed, tested, and refined through the use of computational models
and simulations as virtual prototypes (Garcia, Gocke, and Johnson
1994). Similarly, the availability of Battle Labs suggests the use of
virtual battlefields and command centers for trying out or exercising
complex defense systems in alternative scenarios, through
computer-based modeling and simulation test-beds operating within
networked laboratories (Cothran 1996, Wilson 1996). Accordingly,
approaches such as these may also prove to be effective in supporting
the acquisition of software systems. In this way, viability and
cost-effectiveness of system requirements can be demonstrated,
validated, and refined in an incremental manner. Similarly, estimates
for the cost, schedule, and performance of an ever-more complete actual
system can also be developed and refined incrementally. Subsequently,
we should also consider developing methods and scenarios for how to
transition from the as-is to the to-be acquisition process we envision. </p>
<p><i>We need to articulate the design and operational concept for a
wide-area modeling and simulation infrastructure whose primary purpose
is to serve as a test-bed/delivery platform for agile acquisition of
software-intensive systems.</i> Such an infrastructure may need to
support collaboration and resource sharing between software system
researchers and developers at geographically distributed sites. It may
operate as a modeling and simulation <i>collaboratory</i> (Kouzes,
Meyers, and Wulf 1996) for software system acquisition. Similarly, such
an infrastructure may need to support a hypermedia repository or
digital library of technical data and information that can be accessed
and shared over the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW). Such a digital
library should store and organize access to software acquisitions
assets. These may include publications, model and simulation libraries,
reusable software subsystem components, system demonstration scenarios,
multi-media presentations and annotations. In addition, the digital
library may provide paths to super computing environments that support
massively parallel simulations, etc. </p>
<p><i>We also want to understand how future acquisition processes or
capabilities might exploit the full range of technology
strategies/options at hand.</i> The goal is to minimize cost, maximize
customer satisfaction (via system performance and quality attributes)
and minimize acquisition/development cycle time. Relevant technologies
that can support this goal include the use of knowledge-based systems,
multi-media, the Internet, electronic commerce for selling and buying
software components, architecture-based software system development,
high performance computing and communications, etc. Will new modes of
academic research or industrial activity be required to most
effectively support agile acquisition? If so, what are they? Similarly,
what institutional or marketplace incentives are needed to help make
them happen? </p>
<p><i>We need to prioritize and estimate the relative costs and
benefits of candidate investments in modeling and simulation
capabilities that support software system acquisition.</i> We need to
identify areas in which needs can be met largely through available
technology. We also need to identify areas in which acquisition
research and the development of automated acquisition support
environments promise an attractive return-on-investment. </p>
<h2> <a name="Background"></a>Background and Foreground</h2>
We may now be at the threshold of a new era in the acquisition and
development of software-intensive systems. From this point, we can
look back to where we have been and what we have experienced. Then we
can look forward toward the horizon to see what lies ahead.
<h3> Looking back: why use models and simulations to support program
acquisitions</h3>
In looking back, we see that the acquisition and development of
software-intensive systems was guided by the classic "waterfall"
system life cycle. In such an approach, DoD customers were expected to
be able to articulate their needs and requirements for new system
capabilities prior to system development. Developers or contractors
could then take these requirements as their starting point. Then they
would systematically develop, test, and deliver results to the customer
according to a sequence of development milestones and documentation
standards. While this approach has much rational appeal, its practice
and outcome was often less than satisfactory. The overall experience
was that it was difficult for customers to fully articulate their
system requirements prior to the beginning of system development.
Furthermore, when system development took years, the customer (and the
developer) recognized their requirements were changing, sometimes very
rapidly. Consequently, far too many systems developed under contract
were delivered that did not meet critical system requirements. In the
worst cases, the software systems were effectively non-operational.
Subsequently, more customers and developers began to recognize that
perhaps these shortfalls in software acquisition and development were
systemic, rather than simply characteristic of particular programs or
development organizations.
<p>In response to the seemingly inevitable shortfalls with the classic
approach, effort to find an alternative began. This led to an
incremental "spiral" development approach. In the classic approach,
there is little visibility regarding operational software system
capabilities until late in the development cycle. In contrast, the
spiral approach embraces a more evolutionary and iterative development
model. Accordingly, operational software capabilities become visible in
evolutionary increments, rather than all at once. Subsequent
development iterations then add and integrate more increments until the
final system is ready. Thus the spiral approach seeks to build and
deliver software-intensive systems through evolutionary development.
Consequently, guidelines now put forth in military or public standards
such as&nbsp; MIL-STD-498, ANSI J-STD-016, and US 12207 encourage use
of an incremental spiral approach when acquiring and developing
software intensive systems. </p>
<p>Why should we use models and simulations to support the incremental
acquisition of complex software systems? In simplest terms, we can
identify three reasons: First, to facilitate early identification and
reduction the risks associated with complex system acquisition
programs. Second, to better understand what kinds of system
requirements and architectures are feasible and affordable given
various programmatic and technological constraints. Third, to gain
insight into how to better manage system engineering effort so as to
improve the overall likelihood of a successful, acquisition effort.
However, the creation, use, and reliance of models and simulations to
support incremental acquisition efforts cannot guarantee such outcomes.
Clearly, models and simulations of complex systems will never be more
than assumption-laden approximations of the systems being acquired.
This is the fate of all models and simulations (cf. Smith 1996).
Nonetheless, the <i>process </i>of building, using, and evolving such
models and simulations in support of decision-making activities in
large system acquisition efforts can be characterized as one of&nbsp; <i>consensus
validation</i> (Dutton and Kraemer 1985). Thus, the value of supporting
system acquisition through modeling and simulation will be found in the
process of working with them, rather than in the calculations performed
along the way. Modeling and simulation can be employed to help identify
where consensus can be established and validated, as well as to
identify where disagreements can be found, and their&nbsp; consequences
examined. </p>
<p>Program managers, contractors, customers, and acquisition
directorate staff can employ models and simulations coordinated by a
negotiation support system. Such a system can support the elicitation,
capture, and validation of points of agreement among system acquisition
participants. In addition, such a system can help these people surface
assumptions, debate their merits or implications, and negotiate
alternative system configurations and functional features (cf. Boehm <i>et
al.</i> 1995). In this manner, computer-based models and simulations,
together with an information sharing and negotiation support
environment, provide a&nbsp; more articulate medium to express opinions
and stimulate alternative conceptions of system acquisition problems
and challenges. Without such articulate models and simulations, system
acquisition participants are left to their private intuitions and
conceptions of system design, program cost drivers, and the like. This
in turn can easily obscure problems in system design or performance,
increase the likelihood of miscommunication and systemic conflict, and
increase the likelihood of problematic system acquisition and costly
post-deployment support of the resulting systems. Thus, we believe that
models, simulations, and associated environments can play a significant
role in supporting the incremental acquisition of complex software
systems. </p>
<h3> Looking ahead: An emerging case study</h3>
We see many opportunities for improving the effectiveness and
responsiveness of the acquisition of software-intensive systems across
their life cycle. Many of these opportunities result from the
availability of new technologies and development capabilities that
make the acquisition of software-intensive system more agile. Agility
can lead to more cost-effective, more timely, and higher quality
results in software system acquisition. Modeling and simulation
technologies that support virtual prototyping (Garcia, Gocke, Johnson
1994) and simulation-based design of complex <i>hardware </i>systems
are being used to support major program acquisitions, such as that for
the SC-21 class of battleships (SC21, 1997). We believe a similar
effort is appropriate for acquisition of the large software systems
associated with such hardware systems. Accordingly, by examining the
currently proposed software systems intended to support&nbsp; SC-21
class ships, we can better motivate and articulate a vision for how new
modeling and simulation technologies can be used to help support the
incremental acquisition of complex software systems. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<p>There is no single architecture or final design envisioned for SC-21
ships. Instead, the SC-21 ships could be built following the commercial
practice of developing a <i>product line</i> with common subsystems or
reusable designs. Figure 1 helps show what this means. Here we see four
alternative views of the overall architecture of SC-21 ships. The
intent to enable the choice of the final architecture of each ship to
be determined by emerging need or threat. Nonetheless, any such SC-21
ship will still have some configuration of common sub-systems for
weapons, command deck, flight operations, etc. As such, all of the
alternative versions of ship architecture displayed in Figure 1 would
be members of the SC-21 product line. </p>

<p>Figure 1. Alternative overall architectures for SC-21 ships (SC21,
1997)</p>
</center>
<p>Building these ships according to different architectural
configurations represents a fundamental change in how such ships will
be acquired, developed, and operated. The system life cycle for these
ships will be iterative, incremental, and ongoing. Figure 2 conveys a
vision for how various computer-based modeling and simulation
technologies, such as virtual weapon system modeling and
simulation-based design, may be employed to support the acquisition,
development, and operation of SC-21 ships. <br>

</center>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>SC-21 ships will be software-intensive systems. All major
sub-systems and overall system capabilities supporting each ship's
operations depend on software. Figure 3 proposes a suggested allocation
of shipboard sub-system capabilities that will be implemented in
software systems. Total number of software instructions or source lines
of code (SLOC) to realize the proposed capabilities is estimated at
greater than 8.4 million SLOC. However, much of this software can
potentially be reused across the SC-21 line of ships. Nonetheless,
development costs for software of this size and complexity is often
estimated in the range of&nbsp; $100,000,000 to $1,000,000,000. Thus,
what can be done to help (a) understand the feasibility of alternative
software sub-system architectures associated with the SC-21 ship
family, and (b) manage the progress, costs, and risks associated with
the acquisition and development of this software. <br>

</center>
<p>At present, there is an emerging consensus for what&nbsp;
technological capabilities are needed to support the acquisition and
development of software-intensive systems such as the family of SC-21
ships (cf. Boehm and Scacchi, 1996). Much like the SC-21 family of ship
hardware and major sub-systems employs recent advances in modeling and
simulation technologies, similar technologies could be brought together
to support the acquisition and development of the software systems for
these ships. Accordingly, we can now outline a strategy for how this
would work. We then follow with a discussion of the technological and
organizational transitions likely to be encountered in the course of
adopting this strategy.&nbsp; Along the way, we describe an
approach&nbsp; for how to assess the feasibility of complex software
systems through its incremental development spiral. In addition, we
describe a road map that lays out the research, technology, and usage's
needed to support the acquisition of software systems, such as those
for the SC-21 line of ships. </p>
<h2> <a name="VISTAVision"></a>The VIrtual SysTem Acquisition (VISTA)
Vision</h2>
The <i>virtual acquisition</i> of software systems refers to a
strategic process by which an evolving series of ever more complete
and operational system versions are acquired through a series of short
duration acquisition life cycles. In this way, emphasis is on
re-framing and reducing acquisition cycle times from years to months
(or weeks!) so as to focus attention on the incremental and iterative
acquisition of the evolving capability associated with the target
software system.
<p>Reductions in acquisition cycle time enable an increase in the
number of&nbsp; incremental acquisition cycles over time. The VISTA
approach seeks to help more rapidly identify, address, and resolve the
risks associated with the acquisition and development of complex
software-intensive systems (Boehm and Scacchi 1996; GAO 1997; Haimes,
Schooff, and Chittister 1997). Thus, we need tools that enable
customers and developers to rapidly model, incrementally evolve, and
satisfy (sub) sets of system capability requirements in each iterative
system version. Early acquisition cycles only need to focus on
acquiring systems that only represent computational models and
simulations of the operational capability of the target software
system. Later acquisition cycles then focus on incrementally evolving
or replacing the models and simulations with fully operational system
modules. In this manner, there will always be an operational version of
the system to evaluate and demonstrate throughout the system's
acquisition and development cycle. </p>
<p>Models and simulations represent descriptive, formalized, and
sharable understandings of a system. They can represent a system's
concept of operation, architecture, and its ability to support its
intended mission. However, by focusing effort to enable such
preliminary system capabilities to move through a fast acquisition life
cycle, the goal is to establish and validate consensus on whether
current models and simulations of the software system's
components/architecture address specific system requirements. In
addition, the goal is to determine whether other underdeveloped or
unrecognized system requirements have emerged that need to be addressed
in subsequent acquisition/development cycles. As such, the goal here is
more closely aligned with the idea of incrementally growing and
evolving the target system in a more organic and adaptive manner. </p>
<p>Our first take on the requirements for how this might work can be
outlined as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Acquisition participants should be able to architect, construct,
assemble, execute, and analyze automated models of the overall
software system capability for acquisition.</li>
  <li> Component models should represent elements of target environment
(including people), information system infrastructure, informational
products, and development, operation, and post deployment processes.</li>
  <li> The initial modeling and simulation of these elements should
represent the first pass through the system's requirements generation
and development cycle.</li>
  <li> Participants should be able to iteratively refine and
incrementally evolve the system model test-bed from previous steps.
Then they should be able to selectively replace component models with
simulated, prototype, or actual component elements.</li>
  <li> Participants should be able to iteratively refine and evolve
intermediate hybrid system test-beds and progressively replace
remaining component models with simulations, prototypes, or actual
component elements. This helps to insure that a full-scale test-bed is
developed, operational, and ready for post R&amp;D deployment or
transition into commercial use.</li>
</ul>
Subsequently, we can take this outline of requirements for what we
envision and reformulate it into a first-cut prescriptive process,
which we call the VISTA Approach.
<h2> <a name="VISTAApproach"></a>The VISTA Approach</h2>
At this point, we outline a series of steps that articulate how
software system acquisition and development become intertwined during
virtual system acquisition processes. As modeling and simulation drive
most of these steps, we first describe what types of models are
necessary. We will also characterize what these models may look like,
and how they could be represented. Then we will briefly describe how
these models and simulations would be incrementally replaced when
evolving the system.
<h3> Modeling and simulation in VISTA</h3>
For this discussion, we assume the envisioned system is within the
scope of available software system product families at hand.&nbsp; If
not, then a domain analysis leading to the construction and refinement
of an appropriate <i>meta-model</i> will be needed. Product families
and their associated "smart" product models (SC21 1997), documents,
development processes, tools, and organizational agents are defined and
represented using meta-models. Detailed examples of their use can be
found elsewhere (Mi and Scacchi 1990, Mi and Scacchi 1996, Scacchi and
Mi 1997). We then begin with the elicitation and modeling of a virtual
system model (VSM) for the system to be acquired.
<p>The VSM is a composite model: a model composed from other models. At
least three types of models are needed to characterize a complex
software system. One class of models is needed to represent the
functional operation and data required for information processing by
the system. We will call models of this type; information element
models (IEMs). Once an IEM is replaced with an operational system
component, it becomes an information element (IE). IEMs are used to
model the structure, behavior, and performance (estimated, measured, or
required) of the computing hardware and software that inputs,
processes, and outputs system data. A second class of models is needed
to depict the functional behavior of the IEs embedded within a
man-machine system (E.g., Command and Control System, Theater Air
Dominance System, Mission Support System, etc. in Figure 3) to be
acquired and built. We call these system element models (SEMs), and
when replaced, system elements (SEs). The third class is needed to
represent the "system of systems", sensors, and environmental context
in which the embedded man-machine systems operate. These are called
environment element models (EEMs), and when replaced, environment
elements (EEs). </p>
<p>Each type of model requires a computational mechanism that can
support model entry/definition, interpretation, simulation, and
animated visualization. Commercially available discrete-event
simulation packages represent one such mechanism. These packages are
well suited for simulating models that are represented as queuing
networks whose arrival queues and service rates are specified according
to statistical or algebraic models. </p>
<p>Different types of models may require different kinds of simulation;
thus different tools may be needed. For example, modeling and
simulating the "look and feel" and event-based operation of a graphic
user interface for a Military Support Training System may employ
multimedia authoring or navigation tools. Commercially available tools
such as Macromedia Director, Microsoft Powerpoint, or even Web browsers
accessing virtual reality content across an Intranet can be used for
this purpose. Rapid application development (RAD) tools (Visual Basic,
PowerBuilder, Visual Cafe for Java, etc.) and expert system shells
(E.g., M.4 from Teknowledge) that support software prototyping or visual
programming with persistent databases can enable the modeling and
simulation of complex, rule-based, state-transition software
applications. These are tools for developing virtual prototypes of IEs
(cf. Garcia, Gocke, Johnson 1994). With these tools, it is possible to
model, simulate, or approximate the behavior of software applications
using stubbed, canned, or pre-calculated input/output data values as
place holders for complex calculations required of an eventual software
system implementation. As such, modeling and simulating a VSM may
benefit from use of a computing environment where multiple types of
models and simulations can be defined, composed, simulated, and
displayed. Furthermore, it may be desirable for such an environment to
be accessible over the Internet to facilitate the sharing, discussion,
and review of modeling and simulation efforts among the different
organizational representatives participating in a program acquisition. </p>
<p>IEMs can be modeled in a variety of ways. A common tactic may be to
depict IEMs as hierarchically decomposed black boxes (closed systems),
white boxes (open systems), or gray boxes (closed systems with limited
internal visibility). These boxes are placeholders for hardware or
software system modules that are to be acquired and developed. Each box
can represent a computation unit that can receive inputs or event
signals, perform some calculation, then produce some outputs, state
transition, or some new event. They can be modeled and simulated using
any of the tools noted above. However, depending on the kind of
acquisition concern we wish to address, particular tool choices may be
most appropriate. For example, in SC-21 class ships, it may initially
be an open question as to what level of computer performance is required
to satisfactorily operate Mission Support software systems. A desktop PC
is probably inadequate, while a large mainframe may be too much, too
large, or too expensive. Thus, it seems appropriate to consider
modeling the required computing hardware as a computational module with
mid-range performance or processing throughput (E.g., 10-100
transactions per second) as a starting point. Further, since
determining system performance throughput under different Mission
Support workloads or traffic volume is necessary, then a discrete-event
simulation package may be best to use. </p>
<p>However, the software system modules to operate on this anticipated
hardware may or may not be so readily understood. If we initially have
little knowledge of what calculations or information is required in
processing Mission Support data, then the software's model may simply
equate to that of a module that produces a stream of input/output data
transactions, say in the range of 0-8 transactions per second.
Alternatively, as knowledge increases, software modules may be
identified which perform different functions. </p>
<p>It should be possible to evaluate alternative architectural
configurations or compositions of software modules as a way to
understand whether system performance parameters are sensitive to the
alternatives. For example, in a Mission Support Combat Training System,
one could separate user input capture and verification, calculation and
database update, and output to user display as three distinct software
modules. Should these modules be configured in as a linear sequence, a
fully interconnected concurrent network, or bundled together as a
single large module? Which alternative configuration would be easiest
to build and test? Which would have the best performance? Which would
be the least cost? Perhaps we could guess the best answer(s). However,
if we can model, simulate, and collaboratively discuss the three
architectural alternatives, then we can begin to articulate a basis
that can lead to a consensus answer that can be backed up with
evaluated alternatives and simulation results. </p>
<p>Would the consensus results from such a modeling and simulation
exercise be more believable than someone's best guess? In lieu of some
controlled experiment, the answer is to that is subjective. However,
the modeling and simulation results would be explicit, repeatable, and
subject to trade-off analysis and consensus validation. In addition,
these results can be open to challenge and reformation in a manner that
may be more tractable than someone's best guess. Nonetheless, if
someone such as a software architect experienced in the design of
Mission Support Combat Training Systems can argue persuasively about
her best guess, then this alternative could be represented in an IEM,
simulated, compared and validated. </p>
<p>SEMs provide the ability to embed software systems within
man-machine systems setting. SEMs embed IEMs or IEs in a user-driven
input and output environment. Users create inputs in response to their
work assignments, and to information output from the system and
displayed to them. For example, when using a Training System, users may
select among "menu items" or enter system commands. This may cause the
Training System to process their input, provide an updated user
interface display, then wait for the user's next input action. As such,
SEMs must model user behavior in driving and responding to system
actions or events, as well as model system behavior in response to user
actions. While user behavior is open-ended, only a range of possible
user-system interactions will be modeled. For example, users can only
provide either acceptable input, acceptable but erroneous input that is
detected, or unacceptable input. SEM simulation may include the use of
software "drivers" that cause the arrival of user input or input
events, together with system responses or service time intervals that
follow statistical formulas or some other characterization function.
SEM simulation can then be supported using common discrete-event
simulation tools if user behavior is being simulated. Alternatively, if
the system's behavior is being simulated for real users, then
multimedia or RAD tools may be employed to provide simulated user
interfaces for real users to evaluate. As with the IEM simulations, the
plausibility and consensus validation process noted above will also
apply here. </p>
<p>EEMs provide the ability to embed the man-machine systems in its
overall environmental context. For example, weapons control systems
may be designed to utilize various sensors (radar, sonar, satellites,
etc.) to zero in on their targets. These sensors may themselves be
complex systems. Similarly, weapons control systems will interact with
many other shipboard systems, including those for Mission Support,
Command and Control, etc. These systems must act in concert to realize
the overall effectiveness of a complex system of systems that a ship of
the SC-21 class represents. Therefore, EEMs must model the
interoperation and integration of multiple systems. This may entail
modeling the overall patterns of data or messaging traffic between
systems, as well as between systems and users as a group.
Alternatively, in response to different scenarios for total system
engagement, the EEMs may be used to model the ebb and flow of
information across the system of systems. With this, we expect that the
patterns of information flow on a SC-21 ship in response to a hostile
attack scenario will be different than the flows associated with routine
ship operations and maintenance scenario. Subsequently, these
information traffic or flow patterns can be modeled and simulated using
discrete-event simulation capabilities, and the validation process
described earlier again applies here. </p>
<p>Overall, the remaining challenge is to integrate and interoperate
the different models, simulations, and elements. This is the purpose of
a collaborative test-bed such as a Battle<i>ship</i> Lab for SC-21
class ships (cf. Cothran 1996, Kouzes, Meyers, and Wulf 1996, Wilson
1996). It may serve to support the integration and interoperation of
multiple, mixed mode models and simulation tools, as well as of
multiple system elements with many models and simulations. At this
time, developing such a test-bed may be an expensive but nonetheless
necessary proposition. However, even if the cost of such test-beds
approaches 5-10% of system development costs, such an investment may
be reasonable given that the total overall effectiveness of the system
platform is long-lived, software-intensive, and thus
software-dependent. </p>
<p>Again, our objective is to find ways to facilitate the articulation
and elaboration of requirements, risks, and cost-drivers for complex,
software-intensive systems. It is also to assist those involved in
system acquisition to understand how modeling and simulation tools and
techniques can be used. As such, we now turn to provide a brief
description of how incremental system acquisition and development
would proceed in replacing the system models with operational elements
and system components. </p>
<h3> Incremental replacement of system models with operational system
components</h3>
Given that we have outlined the overall VISTA approach for modeling and
simulation, we can describe how this approach could work in the context
of acquiring a software system. We examine software systems for SC-21
class ships, although we limit our discussion to a representative
subset of software systems for these ships. We use Mission Support
systems in our discussion. Accordingly, we describe how the
information, system, and environment elements for Mission Support are
incrementally acquired and developed in a series of spiraling
iterations following the approach. We show how these elements can change
in progressing from models to actual software system architectures.
Similarly, we identify what difference it makes to improve the
acquisition of software.
<p>The VISTA approach begins with the acquisition of a VSM for Mission
Support. A team of participants from the program office, acquisition
directorate, user representatives, and prospective contractors may
specify the VSM. The team might employ a wide-area collaboratory
environment to share and record information giving rise to the VSM.
However, perhaps only the contractors would be tasked with the modeling
development activity. </p>
<p>The VSM can be subjected to analysis, simulation, redesign,
visualization, and walk-through. Figure 4 provides a concept diagram
for how this might appear if we focus on an architectural configuration
of IEMs (the computer or software elements), SEMs (the physical or
human elements), and the EEMs (the external stimuli outside the system
boundary). As shown in Figures 4 through 6, multiple IEMs, SEMs, and
EEMs are used. This reflects the notion that the scope and depth of
different models may be limited, compartmentalized, or may be divided
among different organization contractors, sub-contractors, program
office, etc.). </p>
<center>
<p><img src="vista1.gif" height="428" width="485"> </p>
<p>Figure 4. Initial VSM Development Cycle</p>
</center>
<p>In acquiring an initial VSM for Mission Support systems, many kinds
of models are used. For example, IEMs designate computer hardware and
software subsystems. SEMs denote Operational Readiness Test System,
Combat Training System, and Display System. Also, EEMs are needed for
other shipboard systems (E.g., Command and Control System), sensors,
and environment factors (weather, combat vs. routine operations,
etc.). Emphasis in developing the initial VSM is on deciding what kinds
of modeling and simulation tools to use for the different types of
model elements. Also, emphasis is directed at how to integrate the
modeled elements into an architectural configuration so that the
simulated elements can interoperate. This is shown in Figure 4.
Subsequently, if all VSM element models can be satisfactorily simulated
at this point using a discrete-event simulation package, then the
integration and interoperation challenges are reduced or eliminated. </p>
<p>Given that the VSM can be developed, we need to exercise and test it
to explore the proposed system's ability to satisfy the requirements of
its customers, users, development contractors, program managers, etc.
Similarly, we need to explore the trade-off among desired system
functional capabilities, performance objectives and costs. A wide-area
software requirement negotiation and collaboration environment, such
as the Win-Win environment developed at USC (Boehm <i>et al</i>.
1995), could be used for this purpose. Collaboration environments like
Win-Win enable various system acquisition and development participants
to discuss the relative merits of the VSM, its ability to identify or
demonstrate system requirements, and to determine and validate where
there is consensus in these areas. For example, user representatives
may believe that response time to user input commands should not be
more than one second. The contractors may note that while such system
performance may be essential for the Combat Training System, it may not
be needed by the Operational Readiness Test System. Thus, it would be
unnecessarily costly to the program to make it so. To help clarify
their position, the contractors input the two alternative system
performance requirements into the computer hardware IEM simulation.
Executing the simulation using the two performance measures may produce
interesting comparative results. For instance, if users of the
Operational Readiness Test System can accept, a four second response
time, the required computer hardware performance can be realized at an
appreciably lower cost, perhaps saving millions of dollars (cf. Boehm
and Scacchi 1996). With this result at hand, the team agrees to revise
the requirements for this information element. As such, the VSM is
revised and calibrated to use this information.&nbsp; This helps to
illustrate the how iterative analysis, simulation,&nbsp; performance
monitoring, and benchmarking can improve understanding system
requirements, and how to identify areas where virtual system
acquisition efforts can reduce costs. </p>
<p>In a later acquisition and development cycle, the team decides to
assemble particular element components using fully operational and
architecturally configured sub-assemblies. Here, the contractors must
replace the corresponding model or simulation elements with
operational prototypes or actual operating elements. Figure 5 provides
a diagram for how this hybrid system and hybrid test-bed might appear.
For example, an EEM for sonar and radar sensors may be replaced with a
test-bed instrument that can generate realistic sensor input data. The
Display System for Mission Support may now be fully operational, and
the computer hardware that supports the Display System may be
operational. Accordingly, the Display System SEM can be replaced with
the operational Display System SE, and the computer hardware IEM can be
replace with its corresponding IE. Nonetheless, even with these virtual
system elements replaced with operational components, the overall VSM
test-bed can still be accessed and evaluated using a collaborative
wide-area environment for requirements negotiation and validation (cf.
Boehm <i>et al</i>. 1995, Kouzes, Meyers, Wulf, 1996). </p>
<p>Once operational components are integrated into the VSM, it becomes
possible to more systematically walk-through, exercise, monitor,
record, and replay the revised VSM hybrid tested. This can help to
validate choices, explore further tradeoffs, and articulate systemic
bottlenecks or processing failures in the system's architecture
(Scacchi and Mi 1997). For example, while evaluating the operational
performance of the Display System that interacts with the Combat
Training System, it appears to users that important information of the
user display is being updated too fast for users to act appropriately.
Instead, the rate of information display needs to be slowed, or the
information content needs to be aggregated and summarized. Thus, from
the user standpoint, the current system operation in the VSM is risky
or infeasible. As before, system element parameters need to be
adjusted, otherwise alternative system architectures need to be
considered and evaluated. </p>
<center>
<p><img src="vista2.gif" height="394" width="514"> </p>
<p>Figure 5. Intermediate VSM Development Cycle</p>
</center>
<p>With an intermediate VSM, further elaboration is needed to field a
deployable system (see Figure 2). If this is the case, then the
acquisition and development team must revisit the selection of
software/system components to develop. Otherwise, they can perform
partly-simulated operational test and evaluation, then experimentally
field the system either across a wide-area Intranet test-bed (Scacchi
and Noll 1997), or in a Battleship Lab test-bed, in order to continue
to calibrate and refine the VSM for further post deployment studies.
Thus, here we seek to illustrate how virtual system acquisition can
help identify potential risks and attendant cost drivers that may not
be manifest until field operation stages of the system's overall life
cycle. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>When further system capabilities are needed, the participants can
exercise the VSM. This means they may adjust simulation parameters,
have users test-drive and evaluate system prototypes, etc. to
determine tradeoffs and validate priorities through consensus.
Consequently, they may choose to revisit the selection of components to
acquire and develop. Jumping ahead, the acquisition and development
participants can continue to evolve and continuously improve the
emerging system architecture. This entails iterating through the
preceding steps until all remaining system component simulations or
prototypes are replaced by their operational counterparts. Figure 6
provides a diagram for how this late stage system architecture might
now appear. </p>
<center>
<p><img src="vista3.gif" height="402" width="547"> </p>
<p>Figure 6. Final VSM Development Cycle</p>
</center>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Here we see that all of the system and information element models
have been replaced with their operational elements. Some EEMs however
remain, since they may designate other major shipboard system
undergoing concurrent development. Thus, while the sensor test-bed may
be operational and integrated to interoperate with the Mission Support
Systems, the Command and Control System as well as other major systems
may not yet be operational and available for integration. However,
these other systems must still conform to their EEMs placeholders for
use with the Mission Support System. Subsequently, an additional
capability is required for characterizing or extracting an updated EEM
from this VSM. This updated information needs to be used in other VSMs
corresponding&nbsp; to environment elements that constitute the system
of systems. From a technical standpoint, this requires addressing
problems in system component interface definition, and in managing
concurrent access to different versions of these components or model
placeholders. From an organizational standpoint, failing to coordinate
access and propagation of component interface definitions or changes is
a common problem that precipitates difficulty in systems integration
and interoperability. Knowing where problems lie, and being able to
prevent or circumvent them through virtual system acquisition, provides
another capability for reducing risks and costs associated with the
development of software-intensive systems. </p>
<p>Finally, throughout the overall VISTA process we have just outlined,
current best practices in software program management (SPMN 1997), and
a consensus recommendation from the Blue Ribbon Panels (Boehm and
Scacchi 1996), point to the opportunity to track and manage software
feasibility/risk using new program management support tools. Figure 7
provides a view of the user interface "dashboard" to such a tool, as
well as suggesting how program management information may be conveyed. </p>
<center>
<p><img src="controlpanel2.gif" height="424" width="622"> </p>
<p>Figure 7. A program management dashboard for assessing software
development progress (SPMN 1997)</p>
</center>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Participants in a virtual system acquisition also need to track,
organize, record, and store records of the steps they took.
Furthermore, they may need to document what transpired, how, by whom,
why, and with what outcomes. These records and documents represent
important knowledge assets emerging from the acquisition effort.
Capturing and organizing this information is often cumbersome and
haphazard. However, we find that these knowledge assets can be easily
captured and linked to the virtual system models and elements using
hypertext mechanisms commonly available in information sharing and
requirement negotiation support environments (Noll and Scacchi 1991,
Boehm <i>et al.</i> 1995), rather than being cast as a mountain of
paper. </p>
<p>With this basis for VISTA approach, we can now put forward a matrix
of the transitional steps for how to realize the technical basis for
supporting VISTA. This is then followed by a description of the
organizational transitions for VISTA. </p>
<h2> Mapping the technological transitions to VISTA</h2>
Although the VISTA-based approach may be a radical departure from
traditional system acquisition practice, getting there may be best
achieved in an evolutionary manner. To be clear, the VISTA approach is
new, but the tools, techniques, and concepts it involves--incremental
acquisition and development, virtual prototyping, wide-area
collaboratories, software requirements negotiation and validation
environments, etc.--are beginning to be used in system acquisition
efforts. Thus, as VISTA implies the need to use an automated support
environment for modeling, simulation, and program management, the
required tools and techniques for such an environment can be
investigated, refined, and deployed in a multi-staged manner. An
integrated information management environment to support the
acquisition and development of complex software systems, such as those
for the SC-21 program, is not yet available. However, such an
environment can be constructed and put into use following the roadmap
outlined below and elsewhere (Boehm and Scacchi 1996). The resulting
environment can then be positioned to support large system acquisition
programs.
<p>We can explain the technological basis to support the transition to
VISTA in terms that cover its anticipated (i) usage in acquisition,
(ii) its technology, and (iii) the research needed to realize its
technology and usage. At the same time, we can characterize how each of
these three aspects correspond to the software system development life
cycle stages that include (a) system concept definition, (b)
architecture definition, and (c) on-going spiral development. Together,
we can associate each of these into a matrix that organizes the VISTA
research, technology, and acquisition usage as shown in Table 1. <br>

<h3> Table 1: VISTA Research, Technology, and Usage Context</h3>
</center>
Moving from top to bottom, right to left, we can outline the associated
operational concepts for VISTA, thereby characterizing the
technological transitions "from <i>ends</i> to <i>means</i>." <br>
&nbsp;
<p><b>Concept Feasibility Determination:</b> Given a new mission or
strategic objective, determine whether appropriate technology,
architectures, and resources can be feasibly brought together into a
new software-intensive system in an affordable and timely manner. </p>
<p><b>Architecture Feasibility Determination:</b> Given a proposed
software system architecture, determine whether it can satisfy mission
or strategic objectives in an affordable and timely manner. </p>
<p><b>Virtual System Acquisition:</b> Given a feasible system concept
and architecture, acquire the proposed architecture as a series of
modeled, simulated, or implemented subsystems. These subsystems can be
evolutionarily developed by progressively replacing or transforming the
modeled or simulated subsystems with prototyped or real
implementations. </p>
<p><b><i>VISTA-1, </i>Top-Level Feasibility Advisor, Parametric Models:</b>
A top-level feasibility analysis-modeling environment is needed for
checking established acquisition heuristics and parameters. Such an
environment could be used to determine whether the candidate
technologies, architectures, and resources can be brought together to
address a new mission or strategic objectives. This environment would
represent the first version of the VISTA support environment (<i>VISTA-1</i>).
The environment proposed by the Software Program Managers Network (cf.
Figure 7), together with software cost estimation tools, software
requirements negotiation capabilities, and access to a collection of
software feasibility heuristics are available today for experimentation
and initial usage (Boehm<i> et al</i>. 1995, STSC 1995, SPMN 1997). </p>
<p><b><i>VISTA-2,</i> Software-Intensive Models and Simulations:</b> <i>VISTA-2</i>is
an enhanced <i>VISTA-1</i> environment for software-intensive modeling
and simulation. It could be used to prototype, analyze, and execute
system architectural capabilities and functionality, then reconcile
these performance characteristics against the cost, schedule, and
quality trade-off among proposed architectural design alternatives. <i>VISTA-2</i>
is used order to determine whether proposed application system
architectures are viable. </p>
<p><b><i>VISTA-3,</i> Hybrid Measurement, Modeling and Simulation
Environment:</b> The <i>VISTA-3</i> environment is built to expand the
capabilities of <i> VISTA-2</i>. In order to acquire incrementally
developed software application systems, <i>VISTA-3</i> can be used to
support the cooperative modeling, simulation, and measurement of the
performance capabilities of an evolving application system, its
subsystems, and their collective architectural design. </p>
<p><b>Software Feasibility Heuristics:</b> We need to collect, validate,
and refine a knowledge base of best practice heuristics for software
system acquisition, architecture, and overall development. This
knowledge could help provide plausible advice for how to assess the
top-level feasibility of an emerging software application system. These
heuristics can help determine what matters, and which technology,
architecture, or resource characteristics affect the overall
feasibility of the system (Rechtin 1991, STSC 1995, SPMN 1997). </p>
<p><b>Architecture representation and analysis M&amp;S and Advanced
cost/schedule/quality M&amp;S:</b> We need to research and develop new
architectural representations that support incremental building and
evolving large application systems using models or simulations. These
representations also must be able to incorporate the architectures of
its subsystems, whether as already implemented or newly development
components. We further need to be able to represent the cost, schedule,
and quality associated with the development of different software
components or architectural configurations. </p>
<p><b>Integration into commercial software development environments
(SDEs):</b> In order for VISTA tools to be broadly applied across the
spectrum of DoD or other large-scale system acquisitions, they need to
become available as extensions (E.g., "plug-ins" or "helper
applications") to commercially available software engineering
environments. </p>
<p>With this context for VISTA research, technology, and acquisition
usage in mind, we can now more simply characterize the overall concept
for how the VISTA might be employed. This can be outlined in four
steps: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Pre-proposal Requirements Analysis:</i> Use the <i>VISTA</i>
environment to analyze feasibility of the system's concept and mission
requirements (a sanity check on the technical perspective for a new
mission program to determine rough order of magnitude for cost,
architecture, other risk items, etc.) prior to the Request For Proposal.</li>
  <li> <i>Proposal Analysis:</i> Upon receipt of development
contractors' proposals, use <i>VISTA</i> to analyze each proposal for
feasibility, determine which proposals are in competitive range, and
what assistance is needed to evaluate the technical perspective (E.g.,
architecture) of those proposals within competitive range.</li>
  <li> <i>Project Start-up:</i> Use <i>VISTA</i> to evaluate the
feasibility of resources (cost, people, etc.) and schedule of proposed
system design. This could also be used for "fly-off" scenarios as
well, when competing designs are being evaluated.</li>
  <li> <i>Ongoing Program Review:</i> Use <i>VISTA</i> to re-analyze
feasibility at progress milestones during development life cycle, as
well as when significant program or system requirements changes occur.</li>
</ul>
VISTA should be applicable to product-line software system
architectures, as well as to unique non-product-line software systems.
It appears that the VISTA may be more readily suited to product-line
software system architectures, since their recurring development can
accommodate the collection, refinement, and calibration of the VISTA
for the product-line's application domain. However, it may also be
useful for (portions of) non-product-line software, especially where a
well-conceived reference model standard, such as the Air Force's
Horizon Architecture defines the software. Nonetheless, within the
domains of C4I, air traffic control, MIS, and other applications, we
may expect future systems to be more likely to conform to product-line
architectures. Industry trends and corporate strategies may then lead
system development contractors to focus their expertise and core
competencies around the mastery of product-lines, rather than
individual products or contracts.
<h2> Managing the organizational transitions to VISTA</h2>
The move to adopt, implement, routinize, and replicate the VISTA
approach seems to be a radical departure from current system
acquisition practices and processes. While we believe that a
compelling technical argument can be made for the VISTA approach, we
must also address the kinds of organizational situations or changes
that must be part of the transition to VISTA.
<p>Personnel will be unfamiliar with VISTA and what is required to
re-engineer the processes they enact during system acquisition.
Mutually respected, collaborative education, elicitation, and
information sharing among the participating user, development
contractor, and program management organizations will be required.
WWW-based collaborative work environments or acquisition collaboratories
(cf. Kouzes, Meyers, and Wulf 1996) can help provide the information
infrastructure needed to support this. However, participation and
engagement in re-engineering system acquisition, development, and
program management must span all levels of the organization chart, and
must achieve commitment, resources, and strategic attention from
executive and senior management in order to increase the likelihood of
success (Bashein, Markus, and Riley 1994). </p>
<p>Our characterization of <i>as-is</i> system acquisition processes
and practices, as well as <i>to-be</i> VISTA based approaches are
understated. Clearly, there is far more detail to system acquisition or
virtual system acquisition processes and practices than can be
described here. Furthermore, we recognize that both as-is and to-be
approaches to system acquisition are put into practice in different
ways, in different organizational settings, for different system
acquisitions. Capturing, understanding, and describing these variations
require systematic research, empirical investigation, and wide-area
dissemination. However, experience has shown that this attention to
detail can lead to distinguishing what's common from what's
circumstantial. Such detail will help surface specific actions to take
to successfully engage personnel to collaborative identify and perform
the organizational transformations needed to transition from the as-is
to the to-be. </p>
<p>Next, as the world moves towards a globally networked information
infrastructure based on the Internet and WWW, we recognize that the
information systems and computer-based tools supporting the
acquisition, development, and program management will increasingly
become heterogeneous relative to one another (cf. Noll and Scacchi
1991, Scacchi and Noll 1997). Interoperability will not be easily
achieved without the experience and expertise needed to make it
happen. However, new information technologies are rapidly emerging that
will give rise to new ways to more rapidly configure, interconnect, and
integrate software systems in order to enable them to interoperate.
Furthermore, what's likely to be critical during early VISTA-based
acquisition and development cycles is <i>realizing interoperability
at the organizational process level</i> , rather than only at the
traditional system function level. Experience shows that addressing
and resolving interoperability between distinct organizations, such as
those participating in a system acquisition, can often lead to ways to
obviate, minimize, or avoid system function interoperability
dependencies (STSC 1995). This helps to refine, streamline, and focus
both system architecture and system development processes. </p>
<p>Last, as indicated earlier, attention in this article is directed at
emphasizing the re-tooling and re-engineering system acquisition
processes and system feasibility assessment. However, a greater payoff
can potentially result from complementary incorporation of process
reengineering concepts, techniques, and tools into VISTA approaches
(cf. Nissen 1997, Scacchi and Mi 1997, Scacchi and Noll 1997, Scacchi <i>et
al</i>. 1997). For example, recent efforts at redesigning acquisition
and procurement processes for the Navy have identified a number of ways
these processes can be transformed and streamlined to realize
substantial reduction in cycle times and administrative costs (Nissen
1997, Scacchi <i>et al</i>. 1997). However, these capabilities have
not been used to support the acquisition of large software systems and
thus require further investigation. Nonetheless, the vision of a 21st.
Century "digital government" raises such matters to be the subject of
systematic acquisition research and empirical investigation befitting a
grand challenge to the academic, industrial, and government research
community (Schorr and Stolfo 1997). Subsequently, the acquisition
community needs to stimulate research that can find new ways to
radically streamline program operations, reduce system costs, and
improve service quality through re-engineering, reinvention, and
systematic utilization of emerging information technologies and
infrastructures. </p>
<h2> Conclusions</h2>
In this article, we identified opportunities for research and
application of modeling, simulation, and evolutionary development
technologies to re-tooling and re-engineering system acquisition
processes. These tools and techniques can help to analyze overall
feasibility and risks at various points in the system acquisition life
cycle. Such a capability offers the potential to reduce software system
acquisition risks and avoidable costs, as well as explore alternative
system options in order to develop more affordable, capable, and
flexible systems. Subsequently, we use the new SC-21 battleship program
as a case study to help illustrate and explain how virtual system
acquisition can work.
<p>We put forward a vision and approach for how to rethink the manner
in which software-intensive systems can be acquired across the
acquisition life cycle. Central to this vision is a new approach to
virtual system acquisition we call VISTA. We believe that VISTA offers
a new strategy for how to address, resolve, or mitigate the recurring
problems that accompanies complex system acquisition. Major program
acquisitions such as the SC-21 class of ships, the Joint Strike Fighter
and others are positioned to take advantage of timely investment and
adoption of VISTA strategies and support environments. </p>
<p>VISTA is a new approach to the acquisition of software-intensive
systems. It seeks to build on knowledge of best practices in as-is
acquisition and development processes, as well as moving toward a
re-tooled and reengineered to-be software systems acquisition and
development process. The acquisition of complex systems such as the
SC-21 class of ships will use virtual prototyping and manufacturing
tools to acquire and build virtual ships using collaborative wide-area
computer-based environments. However, modeling and simulation tools and
techniques have not yet been proposed to support the acquisition and
development of the software systems needed to make the overall ship
system operational and effective. Thus, we propose to fill this gap
with the VISTA approach. </p>
<p>We believe that tools, techniques, and concepts embodied in the
VISTA approach merit consideration and application in forthcoming
large-scale system acquisitions. These include incremental acquisition
interleaved with development, virtual prototyping, wide-area
collaboratories, and software requirement negotiation and validation
environments. However, it would be misleading to indicate that they are
being used together in the manner we suggest. The VISTA approach needs
to be experimentally applied and refined. Accordingly, an R&amp;D
technology roadmap was presented that lays out a path for the
iterative, incremental evolution and integration of the technologies
needed to support the VISTA vision. The technologies needed to support
the VISTA approach need to be brought together and made accessible to
different acquisition participants. </p>
<p>The VISTA approach we presented is a vision of how the acquisition
of software-intensive systems can be designed and streamlined for use
in the years ahead. Major system acquisition programs such as the SC-21
battleships or Joint Strike Fighter aircraft are representative
candidates for the VISTA approach. The success of programs such as
these will depend in part on the successful acquisition and development
of the software systems that enable these platforms to do their job.
VISTA represents a substantial department from and alternative to
present software system acquisition practices (STSC 1995, SPMN 1997).
Nonetheless, we have cast it in a manner that shows how to incrementally
transition from the technology and organizational practices that today
support software system acquisition to the VISTA approach we envision. </p>
<p>Finally, moving to adopt and practice VISTA-based system
acquisitions is not without its risks. Accordingly, we have sought to
identify the technological and organizational transitions that must be
researched, modeled and simulated to help reduce the risks and improve
our understanding of how to evolve system acquisition practices and
support environments to help see the way to the VISTA. In this sense,
the VISTA approach could be demonstrated by applying it to the
acquisition and development of a software system that incorporates the
concepts in this paper and related reports (Boehm and Scacchi 1996). </p>
