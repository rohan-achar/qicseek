No surprises, as   compared to what I described in the lecture on Monday. I have postponed the   due date, howver, until next Friday.</p><p>[November 16, 2001] The STMP java files are available: <a href="SMTPComponent.java">SMTPComponent.java</a>   and <a href="SMTPInterface.java">SMTPInterface.java</a> </p><p>[November 8, 2001] A solution guide to the midterm is available. See the &quot;midterm&quot;   in the schedule for the pointer. The midterms will be returned in the discussion   section on Friday, November 9th.</p><p>[November 5, 2001] The implementation assignment is now available. The due   date for it has been pushed back to Monday, November 19th.</p><p>[November 3, 2001] The slides for week 7 are now available (with page numbers   this time!). I've also made some changes to the schedule and to the reading   assignments. Assignment 2 is now due on 11/7.</p><p>[October 31, 2001] The slides on user interface design are now available.</p><p>[October 29, 2001 ] Girish has provided some <a href="Module_interface_Desc.doc">examples   of module descriptions</a>, such as should be used in Assignment 2. Check them   out. It is a MS Word document.</p><p>[October 15, 2001] The slides for week 4 have been modified <i><b>in a significant   way</b></i>. If you downloaded the slides yesterday evening please be sure to   get the current copy!</p><p>[October 7, 2001] The slides for week 3 are now available. I've also made available   Professor van der Hoek's slides from last spring quarter on software engineering   principles and on requirements engineering. They are &quot;hanging off&quot;   the week 2 segment of the schedule, below.</p><p>[September 28, 2001] <font color="#000000">Beginning Monday, October 1st, the   lecture portion of ICS 52 will meet in ELH 100.</font><font size="+3" color="#000000">   </font><font color="#CC0000"><font color="#000000">Also: the discussion section   will meet Monday, October 1, in its normal time and place.</font></font></p><p>[September 26, 2001] Want to add the class? Here's what you <b>MUST</b> do   before Friday at 1:00.</p><ul>  <li>Send me email requesting that you be added.</li>  <li>Tell me that you have met the prerequisites. (If you have not me the prerequisites     I will not add you. If you tell me that you have met the prereqs and I later     discover that this isn't correct, I will drop you from the class.</li>  <li>Tell me whatever information you believe will help me correctly prioritize     your request as compared to other students' requests, SHOULD the need arise.     For example, graduating ICS majors get first priority. So: tell me your major,     your year, and any extenuating circumstances.</li></ul><HR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="#overview">Overview</A> |<A HREF="#textbooks">Textbooks</A> |<A HREF="#schedule">Schedule</A> |<A HREF="#assignments">Assignments</A> |<A HREF="#TAs">TAs</A> |<A HREF="#touch">Keeping in Touch</A> |<A HREF="#computing">Computing</A> |<A HREF="#cheating">Academic Dishonesty</A> |<BR></center><hr><h1> Instructors</h1><ul>  <LI> Professor <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/"> Richard N.
