Due in Class on November 19 with Presentations November 19 and 21</h3>

<h4>
Assignment Requirements</h4>

This assignment consists of two parts: 1) an update and modification
to the requirements document (see below) and 2) an in-class
presentation limited to 15 minutes and focused on you software
architecture and related design diagrams and descriptions.

<h4>
Purpose and Content</h4>
The Requirements Document focused on <b>what </b>your system will do.&nbsp;
The design document describes <b>how</b> it will be done, giving the overall
picture of how your system is organized.
<p>The design document should also be an evolving document, or a living
document.&nbsp; You should begin by documenting the conceptual model of
your system.&nbsp; As you continue working, this model will be refined
to include more detail, and some things will change.&nbsp; By the time
you turn in your design document, it should contain a reasonably accurate
description of your final system.&nbsp; You will also be asked to turn
in a final version of the document at the end of the quarter that will
include changes made to the requirements and design during the later stages
of implementation.
<p>The design document will consist of the following sections.&nbsp; Sections
1-4 and 8-13 are updates of what you turned in for the Requirements Document.&nbsp;
The remaining sections, 5-7 and 14, are new to the Design Document.

<li>
<b>Architecture Overview</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Architectural Style</li>

<br>What style of architecture did you adopt? Provide a reference to a
defining document.

<p>Shaw and Garlan (in Software architecture: perspectives on an
emerging discipline) have identified the following list of
architectural styles:

<p>&nbsp; 1.Data Flow Style
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Batch Sequential
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pipes and Filters
<br>&nbsp; 2.Call and Return Style
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Program and Subroutines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hierarchical layers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object-oriented (client/server)
<br>&nbsp; 3.Independent Components
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicating processes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event systems
<br>&nbsp; 4.Virtual Machines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule-based systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpreters
<br>&nbsp; 5.Data-Centered Systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transactional Database Systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackboard Systems
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
System Architecture Overview</li>

<p>Others find that UML provides a sufficient architecture
specification, but requires more than class diagrams.

<br>This is the place for your "one great diagram" that shows how your
system is built. You might want to use more than one diagram, to show,
e.g., some different abstractions of the design (such as a data flow view,
a layers of abstraction view, an object view, or an OS process view)
<li>
Subsystem Narrative</li>

<br>What each subsystem means
<li>
Major limitations on the current design</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Modules Specification</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
List of Modules within your system</li>

<li>
For each module, provide a Module Specification</li>

<ul>
<li>
Name</li>

<li>
Definition/Purpose - what it is/does</li>

<li>
Narrative/Comment - how it works</li>

<li>
What are the interfaces or APIs? E.g., using Java terminology</li>

<br>public
<br>private
<br>protected
<li>
Data - What state does it keep, what variables?</li>

<li>
Access - Who has access to the module/object/data?</li>

<li>
How does it fit into the inheritance/with/uses heirarchy?</li>

<li>
Constraints - what constraints are there for this object/module?</li>

<li>
Cardinality - How many will there be?</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Team Specific diagrams</b></li>

<br>See your TA but likely notations include Entity-Relationship (ER)
Diagrams for database projects, UML Sequence Diagrams for
client-server applications, ontologies for knowledge-based projects,
etc.
<li>
<b>Deliverables</b></li>

<li>
<b>Delivery Platform</b></li>

<li>
<b>Terms and Authorization</b></li>

<li>
<b>Development Platform.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Milestones and Effort</b></li>

<li>
<b>Acceptance Test Plan</b></li>

<br>To be more specific in the update of your Acceptance Test Plan, create
a script (2-4 pages) of your intended final presentation. The script may
be in the form of an outline or bulleted list. In some cases, it will be
close to your prototype demonstration. It should tell a choherent and convincing
story that will make your client enthusiastic about signing off on your
project!
<br>You may refer to figures in other parts of your document such as use
cases and / or mock-up's.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Unit and Integration Test Plans</b></li>

<br>Enumerate several key tests for evaluating individual modules and combinations
of modules in your system.
<br>For each test
<ul>
<li>
Test ID</li>

<li>
Purpose of Test</li>

<li>
Item(s) being tested</li>

<li>
Input specification or specific data being tested</li>

<li>
Output specification</li>

<ul>
<li>
Expected Results or Test Oracle Mechanism</li>
</ul>

<li>
Test environmental needs or special test procedures</li>
</ul>
</ol>
