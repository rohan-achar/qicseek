<H2> Real Time Services over Wireless Networks</H2></center>

<H3> Research Abstract</H3>
<br>
Future wireless communication systems are expected to provide a broad 
range of multimedia services including voice, video, and data.  
A cellular architecture is envisioned in order to support the service 
over a wide area.  Due to heterogeneity of the traffic, 
a network based on the packet switching technology may provide a 
more flexible framework and allow a simpler architecture and significant 
cost savings.  Those have been the experiences with the wireline networks, 
which have moved recently to such an integrated architecture.  
By having all data in a packetized form, there is no need to maintain 
a different type of network for specialized applications, 
such as a circuit-switched network for voice telephony, 
which may require different types of equipment and administrative overhead.  
In addition, there is the possibility of using statistical multiplexing 
to increase the utilization of often-limited transmission resources.  
Since network resources are not pre-assigned in a packet-switched network, 
different users or flows can share the network resources and higher 
utilization of may be achieved. In particular, networks based on the 
Internet Protocol (IP) have begun to gain momentum as the platform of 
choice due to their ubiquity and scalability. 
<br>
There are significant hurdles to overcome, however, in building a 
packet-switched wireless network that can serve all types of traffic.  
Not only must the communication link be shared among many users and flows 
while providing adequate QoS, the sharing must be done over the wireless 
channel which is prone to frequent errors and sometimes prolonged outages.  
Transport of packet data traffic over the wireless channel has received a 
lot of attention lately due to increasing use of the Internet from 
wireless devices.  However, much of the work has dealt with 
delay-insensitive data, as most researchers have assumed that 
delay-sensitive applications such as voice telephony will continue to be 
served using a separate circuit-switched network dedicated to such 
applications. To make the idea of extending the packet-switched framework 
to the wireless network more feasible, there remains much work to be 
done on how to efficiently serve different types of data over a medium 
that is relatively scarce and fraught with errors. 
In this resesarch project, 
we focus on the transport of real-time packets such as 
those from voice over IP (VoIP) applications which may make up an 
important subset of traffic over 
the future packet-switched wireless networks.
