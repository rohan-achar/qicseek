<H2>Connecting and Disconnecting the Jimage client to Chimera</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
The Jimage client application needs to be connected with Chimera in order
for it to utilize Chimera's hypermedia services.  When Jimage is 
started, it looks for the Chimera Server.  If it is found running,
Jimage will connect to it.
</p>

<p> You are allowed to connect or disconnect with the Chimera Server 
using the commands available on the Chimera menu on Jimage.
</p>

<p> Note: The Chimera Server is a program running in the user's environment
which selects Chimera Websites for the user's client applications.  
See 
<A HREF="starting_cs.html">Starting the Chimera Server on the Client Side
</A> for more information about the Chimera Server.

which indicates the state of 
the connection between Jimage and the Chimera Server.  The right
most box on the status bar indicates whether  
Jimage is connected to the Chimera Server, note the 
word connected in the right most box indicates Jimage is connected to
