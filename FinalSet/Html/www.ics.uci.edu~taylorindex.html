     2004). He received the Ph.D. degree in <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/">Computer
      Science</a> from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1980. His research
       interests are centered on design and software architectures, especially
      event-based and 
  peer-to-peer systems and the way they scale across organizational boundaries.
       Professor Taylor is the Director of the <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/">Institute
        for Software Research</a>, which is dedicated to fostering innovative
        basic  and applied research in software and information technologies

               Influential Paper Award</a>&quot;, along with 
               co-authors Peyman Oreizy and Nenad Medvidovic, for &quot;<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=302181">Architecture-based
               runtime software evolution</a>&quot; from ICSE 1998. In May, 2009
               he was recognized with the 2009 <a href="http://www.sigsoft.org/awards/outResAwd.htm">ACM
               SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award</a>. In February 2010 he was
               designated a University of California, Irvine <a href="http://www.ap.uci.edu/distinctions/titles.html">Chancellor's

<h1> Institute for Software Research (<a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/">ISR</a>) 
</h1>

<p>
Established in July 1999, the University of California's Institute for Software 
  Research (ISR) is dedicated to
</p>
<ul>
  <li> fostering innovative basic and applied research in software and information 
    technologies; </li>
  <li>working with established companies, startups, government agencies, and standards 
    bodies to develop and transition the technologies to widespread and practical 
    application; </li>
  <li>educating the next generation of software researchers and practitioners 
    in advanced software technologies; </li>
  <li>supporting the public service mission of the University of California in 
    developing the economic basis of the State of California. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The Institute's activities are focused on: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct support of research projects, including funding personnel </li>
  <li>Research support services (administrative services)</li>
  <li>Conference and seminar services </li>
  <li>Technology transition</li>
</ul>
The Institute extends beyond the boundaries of UC Irvine and includes faculty
from a variety of institutions. The Institute's web site details the faculty, staff, and students involved, the current projects, 
events, and news.

<h1> Research </h1>
<p>
My research is focused on design &#8212; the issues, techniques, and agents 
  involved in creating and evolving software artifacts and processes. Specific 
  emphases include: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/">software architecture</a>: 
    means for designing, organizing, and describing distributed and decentralized 
    applications.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">architecture-based 
    software development environments</a>: tools to support the conceptual approach, 
    ranging from design-time tools to implementation to run-time dynamic adaptation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The foundational work on architectures has centered on means for <a href="documents/2000-ADLs-TSE.pdf">describing
 architectures</a> in various styles and development of new architectural styles
  (notably <a href="documents/1995-C2-TSE.pdf">the &quot;C2&quot; components-and-connectors
   style</a> and, with Roy Fielding, the <a href="documents/2002-REST-TOIT.pdf">REST
    style</a> for Internet applications such as the WWW). Current work in this
    domain  is directed at developing, with Michael Gorlick and Justin Erenkrantz,
    the <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1287624.1287660">CREST style</a> for computational exchange on the Internet.</p>
<p>
The environment and tools work has emphases on environment architectures (see 
  <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">the ArchStudio site</a> 
  for details), an <a href="documents/2002-xADL-ICSE.pdf">extensible software
   architecture description language and supporting toolkit</a> (see <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">the
    xADL web site</a> for the details and the download), and <a href="documents/1999-Self-AdaptiveSW-IEEEIS.pdf">architecture-driven
     dynamic adaptation of applications</a>. Virtually all of this work utilizes
      event-based approaches. A variety of publications in this area can be found
      at <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/publications.html">http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/publications.html</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="SoD-proposal.pdf">Proposal
     for a School of Design at the University of California, Irvine</a> (dated
     November  2002; PDF format; 188 pages; 8.5M) recommends establishment of
     a research-based  school having an interdisciplinary approach to design
     and a comprehensive array  of degree programs at the bachelor's, master's,
     and doctoral levels.  The School of Design proposal was transmitted
  to the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate on January 13, 2003. The proposal
     is no longer under active consideration, but remains a vision document for
     the design research community.</p>

<h1> The Things that Really Matter </h1>

<ul>
  <li> My Family! <a href="pictures/prof-Taylor-family.jpg"> </a><a href="pictures/Taylor-Hiking.jpg"> 
    This picture </a> is of my wife and myself halfway up the Aiguille du Midi, 
    near Chamonix.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.standrewspres.org/"> St. Andrew's Presbyterian </a> 
    is where you'll find me on Sunday. Look for me in the    choir  singing tenor II. Here's a <a href="pictures/St-Andrews0102.jpg"> 
    photo of the St. Andrew's choirs, </a> taken in April of 2002.
  </li>
<li> Music: anything baroque, sacred choral music, <a href="http://www.rondoveneziano.com">Rondo
     Veneziano</a>. 
  </li>
  <li> The mezzotints of John Martin. See, for example, <a href="http://search.famsf.org/4d.acgi$Record?63798&=list&=41&=John%20Martin&=And&=50&=0&=keywords&=Yes&=&=&=&=Yes&=&=f"> 
    Adam and Eve,The Morning Hymn </a>. 
  </li>
  <li> Most everything French, but especially food and <a href="http://www.st-barths.com/"> 
    St. Barts </a>.  Cannes  is 
    wonderful, except during the cheesy film festival...
  </li>
</ul>
