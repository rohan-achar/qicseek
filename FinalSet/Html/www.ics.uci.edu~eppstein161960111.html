<h1>Sequential and Binary Search</h1>

Example: looking up a topic in Baase. Suppose after Tuesday's
application of matrix multiplication to Fibonacci numbers, that you
wanted to know what she says about matrix multiplication. 

<p>You could look it up in the index but it will give you many
different pages to look at, some of which are only somewhat
relevant. Or you could read through the table of contents until you
find relevant looking titles (6.2 and 7.3).</p>

<h2>Sequential search</h2>

The second method (reading through the table of contents) is an
example of <i>sequential search</i>. Similar sorts of problems show
up all the time in programming (e.g. operating systems have to look
up file names in a directory, and the Unix system usually does it
with sequential search). 

<p>Very abstractly:</p>

<pre>
    sequential search(list L,item x)
    {
    for (each item y in the list)
        if (y matches x)
        return y
    return no match
    }
</pre>

This has many variants -- do you stop once you've found one match
or do you keep going until you've found all of them? do you
represent the list using pointers, linked lists, or what? how do
you indicate that there was no match? 

<p>So we want to analyse this...</p>

<p>To really understand the running time, we have to know how quick
the "y matches x" part is -- everything else is straightforward.
The way I've written it in pseudocode, that part still needs to be
filled in. But we can still analyse the algorithm! We just measure
the time in terms of the number of comparisons.</p>

<p>Examples: does 8 appear in the list of the first 10 Fib.
numbers? Does 9? Note for 9, algorithm has to go through whole
list.</p>

<p>So the time seems to depend on both L and x. We want to be able
to predict the time easily without running the algorithm, so
saying</p>

<pre>
    comparisons(x,L) = position of x in L
</pre>

is true but not very informative. 

<h2>Methods of analysis</h2>

To be able to predict the time without having to look at the
details of the input, we measure it as a function of the length of
the input. Here x has basically constant length (depending on what
an item is) and the length of L is just the number of items in it. 

<p>So given a list L with n items, how many comparisons does the
algorithm take? Answer: it depends.</p>

<p>We want an answer that doesn't depend. There are various ways of
getting one, by combining the times for different inputs with the
same length.</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="worst"></a></li>

<li><b>Worst case analysis</b> -- what is the most comparisons we
could ever see no matter how perverse the input is? 

<pre>
    time_wc(n) =        max         time(I)
         (input I of size n) 
</pre>

<a name="best"></a></li>

<li><b>Best case analysis</b> -- what is the fewest comparisons the
algorithm could take if the input is well behaved? 

<pre>
    time_wc(n) =        min         time(I)
         (input I of size n) 
</pre>

<a name="average"></a></li>

<li><b>Average case analysis</b> -- how much time would the
algorithm take on "typical" input? 

<p>We assume that each input I of size n has a probability P[I] of
being the actual input and use these proabilities to find a
weighted average:</p>

<pre>
    time_avg(n) = sum P[I] time(I)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

These distinctions didn't make sense with Fibonacci numbers because
the time there was always a function of n, but here they can give
different answers (we'll see with sequential search). 

<p>Average case is probably the most important in general, but is
problematic in terms of what is a typical input? You have to make
some assumption about the probabilities, and your analysis will
only be as accurate as the validity of your assumptions. Also note
that it's possible to have an algorithm for which no input takes
the "average" time -- e.g. if it takes either 1 step or 100 steps,
the average may be around 50 even though no input actually takes 50
steps.</p>

<p>Worst case is what we usually do, it's easier than average case
analysis and it's useful because you can guarantee that the
algorithm will not ever take longer than its worst case bound. It's
also true that the average case is at most the worst case, no
matter what probabilities you choose, so you can use worst case
analysis to get some information about the average case without
having to make assumptions about what a "typical" input looks
like.</p>

<p>Best case is fun but not very useful.</p>

<h2>Analysis of sequential search</h2>

The best case for sequential search is that it does one comparison,
and matches X right away. 

<p>In the worst case, sequential search does n comparisons, and
either matches the last item in the list or doesn't match
anything.</p>

<p>The average case is harder to do. We know that the number of
comparisons is the position of x in the list. But what is typical
position of x?</p>

<p>One reasonable assumption: If x is in the list, it's equally
likely to be anywhere in it. so P[pos] = 1/n.</p>

<pre>
    average number of comparisons

     n   1
     =  sum  - . i
    i=1  n

    1  n
     =  - sum  i
    n i=1

     = (n+1)/2.
</pre>

But if x is not in the list, the number of comparisons is always n.


<p>So finding something takes half as long as not finding it, on
average, with this definition of "typical".</p>

<p>We can define a stronger version of "typical": suppose for any
list, any permutation of the list is equally likely. Then we can
average over all possible permutations:</p>

<pre>
    average number of comparisons

     n!  1
     =  sum  -  . (position of x in permutation i)
    i=1  n!

     n  1
     =  sum - . p . (number of permutations with x in position p)
    p=1 n!

     n  1
     =  sum - . p . (n-1)!
    p=1 n!

     n  1
     =  sum - . p
    p=1 n

     = (n+1)/2.
</pre>

So this assumption ends up giving the same analysis. 

<p>A second point to be made about average case analysis: sometimes
it makes sense to analyse different cases separately. The analysis
above assumes x is always in the list; if x is not in the list, you
always get n comparisons. You could make up a probability p that x
is in or out of the list and combine the two numbers above to get a
total average number comparisons equal to pn + (1-p)(n+1)/2 but it
makes more sense to just report both numbers separately.</p>

<h2>Randomized algorithms</h2>

Sometimes it's useful to pay a little bit to reduce the uncertainty
in the world -- e.g. insurance, you know you'll pay a fixed amount
instead of either paying nothing (if you stay healthy) or a lot (if
you get appendicitis). 

<p>the same concept applies to computer programs -- if the worst
case is much larger than the average case, we might prefer to have
a slightly more complicated program that reduces the worst case as
long as it doesn't increase the average case too much. For instance
if you're programming the computer controlling a car, and you want
to tell if you're in a crash and should activate the air bags, you
don't want to be running some algorithm that usually takes half a
second but maybe sometimes takes as much as five minutes.</p>

<p>Random numbers are very useful in this respect. they're also
useful in making "average case" analysis apply even when the input
itself is not random at all, or when we don't know a good
definition for a "typical" input. The idea is to "scramble" the
input so that it looks typical. We say that an algorithm is <i>
randomized</i> if it uses random numbers. An algorithm that is not
randomized is called <i>deterministic</i>.</p>

<p><a name="expected">The "expected time" analysis of a random
algorithm is measured in terms of time(input,sequence of random
numbers). For some particular input I, the expected time of the
algorithm is just the average over different sequences of random
numbers:</a></p>

<pre>
        sum    Prob(R) . time(I,R)
    (random sequence R)
</pre>

The expected time of the algorithm on (worst case) inputs of length
n is then computed by combining this formula with the previous
formula for worst case analysis: 

<pre>
        max             sum        Prob(R) . time(I,R)
    (input I of size n) (random sequence R)
</pre>

This looks complicated, but isn't usually much harder than average
case analysis. Here it is for sequential search. 

<p>We want to scramble (x,L) so that position of x in L is random.
Idea: pick a random permutation of L then do the sequential
search.</p>

<pre>
    randomized search(list L,item x)
    {
    randomly permute L
    for (each item y in L)
        if (y matches x)
        return y
    return no match
    }
</pre>

This slows down the algorithm somewhat (because you have to take
time to do the permutation) but may speed up the searching part. If
you're just searching for a number in a list of numbers, this would
be a pretty bad method, because the time for doing the random
permutation would probably be more than the worst case for the
original deterministic sequential search algorithm. However if
comparisons are very slow, much slower than the other steps in the
algorithm, the total number of comparisons will dominate the
overall time and this algorithm could be an improvement. 

<p>Let's plug this algorithm into our formula for expected
times:</p>

<pre>
    time = max(x,L) sum(permutation p) probability(p) time(x,p(L))
</pre>

Note there are n! permutations. of those, there are (n-1)! such
that x is in some given position i. 

<pre>
    time = max    sum  sum                 prob(perm) . time(x,L')
        (x,L)  i    (perm w/x at pos i)

     = max    sum  #(perms w/x at pos i) 1/n! . i
        (x,L)  i   

     = max    sum  (n-1)!/n! . i
        (x,L)  i   

     = max(x,L) sum(i) i/n

     = (n+1)/2
</pre>

so the number of comparisons is exactly the same as the average
case but now it doesn't matter what the list is. 

<p>We'll see that same idea of using random permutation to avoid
the worst case later, in the quicksort and quickselect algorithms.
For both of these algorithms, the use of randomization decreases
the running time enormously, from O(n^2) to O(n log n) or O(n).</p>

<p>It is also sometimes possible to make stronger forms of analysis
about random algorithms than just their expected time, for instance
we could compute the variance of the running time, or prove
statements such as that with very high probability, an algorithm
uses time close to its expectation. This is important if one wants
to be sure that the slow possibilities are very rare, but is
usually much more complicated, so we won't do much of that sort of
analysis in this class.</p>

<h2>Binary search</h2>

Let's go back to the original example -- finding matrix
multiplication in Baase. I talked about looking it up in the table
of contents (by sequential search) but also about looking it up in
the index. 

<p>The index of Baase and most other books has the useful property
that it's alphabetized, so we can be smarter about our search. For
instance, we could stop the sequential search whenever we found a
y&gt;x, and this would speed up the time for x not in L. But we can
be much better, and this is basically what people do in
alphabetized lists.</p>

<pre>
    binary search(x,L)
    {
    let n = length of L, i=n/2.
    if (n = 0) return no match
    else if (L[i] matches x) return L[i]
    else if (L[i] &gt; x) binary search(x,L[1..i-1])
    else binary search(x,L[i+1..n])
    }
</pre>

Recursion is not really necessary: 

<pre>
    alternate search(x,L)
    {
    let n = length of L
    let a = 1, b = n
    while (L[i = (a+b)/2] doesn't match)
        if (L[i] &gt; x) b = i-1
        else a = i+1        
        if a&gt;b return no match
    return L[i]
    }
</pre>

Analysis: T(n) = O(1) + T(n/2) = O(log n) 

<p>More precisely in the worst case, T(n) = 2 + T(ceiling((n-1)/2))
which solves to approximately 2 log n (logarithm to base 2).</p>

<p>So binary search is fast, but in order to use it we need to
somehow get the list to be in sorted order -- this problem is known
as sorting, and we'll see it in much detail next week.</p>
