<h1> Applets </h1>
<body>
<h3> The hierarchy </h3>
<pre>
   Object -> Component -> Container -> Panel -> Applet ->  your program
                              \
                                 -->  Window -> Frame : for applications
</pre>
Note: Applets can open windows and frames also.
<h3> Words Applet </h3>
Here we display words at random on the screen.
<br> Suppose the file name is  Words.java.

<pre>
 import java.applet.*;
 import java.awt.*;

public class Words extends Applet 
 {
   int random(int i)
 {
   return Math.round(Math.random()*i) ;  // calls to class methods
 }

   public void paint(Graphics g)       // overriding paint
 {
   String fontName = getParameter("font");  // taking parameters from html file
   Font f = new Font(fontName, Font.BOLD,18)
   g.setFont(f);
   for (int i = 0; i<10; i++)
      g.drawString(random(200),random(100),"Don't touch"); // graphics upside down
 }  
}

</pre>

<h3> Applet Syntax </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Just like an application an applet is
   a collection of classes.
     <li> Rules for execution and definition
     of classes are the same, except for the driver class
and reading of html files.
     <li> You also need to define an associated html file.
     <li> The browser first reads the html file.
     <li> Parameters can be passed from the html file to
     the applet via getParameter(...).
      <li> After reading the html file, loading the
applet and executing any static expressions and blocks, then
 the applet is executed.
     <li> The driver class for an applet is a class
      which extends applet and is called first by the
      browser or appletviewer.
     <li> Typically applets respond to events. We will discuss
    event-driven programming later, as they have another model
   of interpretation.
     <li> Browsers have  security managers which place various
     restrictions on Applets for obvious reasons. Typically you
    are not allowed to read or write files.
     </ul>
<h3> Applet Methods </h3>
Applets are event-driven. The most basic event is visiting
the html page on which the applet resides. We will discuss
other events later.
<ul>
  <li>void  init() Trigger Event: first visit to html page.
 <br> This is the first method that is executed.
   Typically one creates all the needed visual objects and other
objects here. This method is only executed once and behaves much like a constructor.
  <li> void start() Trigger Event: every visit to html page.
 <br> This method is called after init and everytime the
  user revisits the page. This <b> resumes </b> the computation.
  <li> void stop() Trigger Event: moving off the page.
 <br> The default suspends the applet from running. So this can be
     executed multiple times, just like start().  
 <li>void destroy() Trigger Event: Browser closes applet.
<br> This behaves somewhat like a destructor in C++ in that
     all resources associated with the applet are now released. Before
    it is executed, stop() is called for the last time.
</ul>

<h3> Graphic Methods inherited from Component </h3>
 Graphics objects are measured in pixels.
  <ul>
  <li>public void paint(Graphics g):
 <br> This method must be executed to render anything on the
  display. It does the drawing.
  <li>public void repaint():
<br> This schedules update(), i.e.
  puts update into the task list.
   Multiple calls to repaint() may yield only one call to update().
  <li>public void update(Graphics g):
 <br> The default method redraws
the background and calls paint() on each of the visual components.  By
overriding this method you can selectively update the display, which is useful
for animation.
</ul>
<h3> Another Applet Example </h3>
<pre>
/*
   Simple fractal program that illustrates recursion.
   Recall that the vector <-y,x> is perpendicular to the vector <x,y>.
   Check the dot product.
 */

import java.awt.*;
import java.applet.*;

public class Fractal extends Applet {

	public void init()
	{
           resize(600,400);
	}	
	
	Point addPoints(Point one, Point two)
	{
	    return new Point (one.x+two.x,one.y+two.y);
	}
	
	Point up(Point one, Point two, double scale)
	{
	     int x = (int) (scale*(two.x-one.x));
	     int y = (int) (scale*(two.y-one.y));
	     return addPoints(one, new Point(x,y));
	}
	
	Point rotate(Point one,Point two)
	{
	    Point p = up(one,two, 1.0/2);
	    int y = (int)((one.x - two.x)/4.0 );
	    int x = (int) ((two.y- one.y)/4.0);
	    return addPoints( p, new Point(x,y));
	}   
	    
	public void drawFractal(Point b,Point e, int d, Graphics g)
	{
	    if (d == 0) g.drawLine(b.x,b.y,e.x,e.y);
	      else
	     {
	        Point next = up(b,e,1.0/4);
	        Point mid = rotate(b,e);
	        Point last = up(b,e,3.0/4);
	        drawFractal(b,next, d-1,g);
	        drawFractal(next,mid,d-1,g);
	        drawFractal(mid,last,d-1,g);
	        drawFractal(last,e,d-1,g);
	   	 }
	}
	
	public void paint(Graphics g)
	{
	  g.setColor(Color.blue);
	  Point begin = new Point(100,200);
	  Point end = new Point(500,200);
	  int depth = 4;     // How deep is too deep?
	  drawFractal(begin,end,depth, g );
	}
