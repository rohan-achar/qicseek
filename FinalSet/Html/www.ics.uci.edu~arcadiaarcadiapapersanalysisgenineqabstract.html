"<b>Automatic Generation of Inequality Systems for Constrained Expression 
Analysis</b>"</A>,
by George S. Avrunin Ugo Buy and James Corbett in Technical Report 90-032,
Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1990.


<H2> Abstract </H2>

This report describes a prototype tool for automating the generation of 
systems of inequalities, and for aiding in the interpretation of the 
solutions of such systems, in the analysis of constrained expressions. 
The constrained expression approach to the analysis of concurrent and 
distributed software systems is described in [4,5]; more detailed 
descriptions of the use of inequalities in such analysis are given in 
[2,5,6]. This prototype implements a piece of a toolset supporting automated 
analysis of distributed system designs written in the CEDL design language 
[11], which is based on Ada. The structure of the toolset and its 
application are described briefly in the next section and in more detail 
in [4]. Detailed discussions of the other components of the toolset are 
given in [1,7,9,12].  This document describes version 2.0 of the prototype, 
whose implementation has been completed recently.
