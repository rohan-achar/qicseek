<!-- On Tuesday, we expect to have a visit from Elizabeth Losh, author of the <a href="http://www.virtualpolitik.blogspot.com/">Virtualpolitik</a> blog and an expert in &quot;digital rhetoric&quot; (how we write effectively for electronic media). She will talk about Vannevar Bush, who predicted the Web decades ago in his classic article, &quot;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/194507/bush">As We May Think</a>.&quot; He got some things wrong, too, and it will be interesting to talk about which predictions succeeded and which didn't.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>For Tuesday's class, read the article. To focus your reading, consider the questions below. We're not asking you to write out answers and turn them in, but we do expect you to have answers in mind for Tuesday's class.</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
</FONT></P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
<ol><li>What is the Memex?  What are its design features?  How is it similar and dissimilar to the networked personal computers of today?</li>
<li>What kind of user is Bush imagining?  In what situations does he describe the Memex being used?  (Business computing?  Recreational computing?  Social computing?  Archival storage?)</li>
<li>What kinds of input mechanisms are described by Bush?  (Think about all the devices he describes now, not just the Memex.)  What kinds of input mechanisms are not described?</li>
<li>What kinds of output mechanisms are described?</li>
<li>What does Bush say about the problem of natural languages?</li>
<li>How does Bush describe both paying for content and file-sharing between friends?  How does he justify this device economically?</li></ol></FONT>

 Read Bruce Tognazzini's article, &quot;<a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html">A Quiz Designed to Give You Fitts</a>.&quot; There's a lot of interesting material at his <a href="http://www.asktog.com/index.html">asktog.com</a> site.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Look over the &quot;<a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/index.html">Perception in Visualization</a>&quot; page by Christopher G. Healy. You don't have to read the entire text, but you should scan the examples and spend a few minutes playing with each of the two interactive demonstrations on the page.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>There's nothing to turn in for this part, but these ideas may show up later.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B> (optional) </FONT><font size="4" face="AGaramond">Do this <a href="http://www.tele-actor.net/fitts/index.html">on-line study</a> illustrating Fitts' Law. It doesn't include much explanation, but the task should give you a tangible understanding of the principle behind Fitts' Law. 
<!-- If you'd like to explore Fitts' Law even further, check out Alfred Kobsa's <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/KobsaFittsHW.webarchive">Fitts' Law assignment</a> (which actually lets you measure things and plug in real numbers).

<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B> In class this week we have
  discussed these topics, among others:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Miller's 7 +/&ndash; 2 items (capacity of short-term memory)</FONT><BR>
</LI>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Pre-attentive processing, gestalt laws</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Fitts' Law</FONT><BR>
</LI>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Graphical coding</FONT><BR>
</LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Anthropomorphism</FONT></LI>
<LI><font size="4" face="AGaramond">Affordances</font></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Pick three of these six topics; for each of
the three, choose an example from your HCI notebook that illustrates
the topic (or find an example
from your own experience if your notebook doesn&#39;t have one).  Don't choose examples we discussed in class or that come directly from the readings. Your examples may show a misapplication or misunderstanding
of the principles or may be a particularly good example; in either case,
describe and analyze each example using the terms and guidelines that pertain
to the topic it illustrates.  If your example is a negative one, suggest
an improvement and describe why your suggestion is better.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>A dozen pithy lines of text should be sufficient for each of the three examples
(where &quot;pithy&quot; means clean, clear, well-organized, terse, and
not padded); half a page for each is an absolute
maximum.  (Again, this refers just to the text; you will probably use more
than half a page each if you count illustrations.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B> One measure of user efficiency for certain systems is to count the number of steps or keystrokes that common operations require.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Monitor your own cellphone usage over at least two full days. What are the (four or five) most common tasks you perform (making a call, sending a text, ...)? Treat tasks that have different keystroke sequences (like phoning someone from your contact list vs. phoning someone by typing in their phone number) as separate tasks. For each of your common tasks:</FONT></P>
<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>How many keystrokes does the task take? [For some tasks, like playing a game or sending text message, the total number of keystrokes depends on the game play or the particular message. In those cases, just count the <em>other</em> keystrokes—what it takes to select and launch the function (and to quit it at the end). On some phones, the user makes gestures instead of or in addition to keystrokes; if your phone is like that, you can count gestures, but a gesture typically conveys more information than a single keystroke.] </FONT></li>
<li><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does the task require visual confirmation or can you do it all with audio and tactile feedback? (In other words, could you do this task while keeping your eyes on the road?)</FONT></li></ul>
<p><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4> You can use your HCI Notebook to record this information (since you're carrying it with you at all times, right?).</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>A simple table would be enough to communicate your results for this part.</FONT></P>
<P><font size="4" face="AGaramond">(If you don't have a cellphone, check with us for an alternative.)</font></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(e)</B> How many different items have
  you recorded in your HCI notebook so far?  We&#39;ll give full credit for
  any truthful answer to this, even zero, but we&#39;d like to know how much
  use the class is making of these notebooks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<!--
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B>  Look at the HP Cooltown video
(giving a vision of ubiquitous computing) at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://cooltown.hp.com/mpulse/backissues/0601/0601-cooltown.asp">http://cooltown.hp.com/mpulse/backissues/0601/0601-cooltown.asp</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,
considering it in terms of agents, anthropomorphism, social conventions,
and its emotional effects on its users.  You may answer in terms of the
technological vision (i.e., assuming that the system will be implemented
essentially as described in the video) or in terms of technological realities
and limitations (i.e., considering what difficulties might actually prevent
the video&#39;s vision from being realized), or both.  What social and emotional
effects, especially unintended ones, might Cooltown produce?</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Give your reaction, opinion, and analysis
of these issues in half a (single-spaced) page, with one page as a maximum.
 At that relatively short length, of course you won&#39;t be able to cover
every aspect in depth; just show us that you&#39;ve thought seriously about
these issues.</FONT></P>-->
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(f)</B>  This part is preparation for a
later assignment. You can do it before, during, or after this week's class meeting. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Pick a partner who is also enrolled in the
class.  Together, find three different application programs that perform
the same function.  Choose applications that do something relatively simple:
 Rather than a word processor or a database or a graphics editor, choose
a desktop calculator, a virtual alarm clock, a Shanghai game, an instant
messaging client, or any other single-function tool.  Identify three different
versions (perhaps using shareware sources on the Internet; nobody should
have to purchase anything for this assignment) and install them on a machine
(or machines) you can use.  It would also be acceptable to choose three
web sites with similar aims (e.g., the travel sites Expedia, Orbitz, and
Travelocity), though they may be more complex than single-function applications.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>In a later assignment, we will ask you to
compare the user interfaces of these applications.  They are likely to have
some differences in functionality, but we will ask you to concentrate on
tasks that all three perform and the HCI aspects of those comparable tasks.
 For now, though, just find a partner, decide on an application category,
and locate and install the software (or locate the web sites).  You don&#39;t
need to turn anything in for this part.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Combine all your answers into one electronic
document (making sure your name, student ID number, and UCInet ID are at the top) and submit it via Checkmate.  </FONT><BR>
