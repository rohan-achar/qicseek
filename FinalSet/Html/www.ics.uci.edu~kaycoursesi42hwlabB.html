<p><strong>Assignment summary:</strong> You will write a program to keep track
  of reservations at a small "bed and breakfast" hotel.</p>
<p>
This assignment is divided into six required stages and optional
seventh stage. Each succeeding stage is built upon what you
have already written for the previous stage. We expect you to design,
write, and test this program according to these stages—first get the
first-stage program working, then modify it to satisfy the second
stage, and so on.  As always, be sure to keep a copy of each completed
stage. That way, if you decide you've gotten off on the wrong track
for a stage, you can start again easily from the end of the previous
stage, without the painstaking task of removing each addition.
You should make sure that each stage is entirely correct and working
perfectly before you go on to the next. As you complete each stage,
you must demonstrate briefly to your TA or tutor that it works
correctly before you go on to the following stage. </p>

<p><strong>What to turn in:</strong>
On Checkmate, a single Python file containing your last-stage code.
  </p>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong> Your grade depends on organized development (did you design and debug each stage in sequence), completeness (does your program do everything the specification requires), correctness (does it produce the correct results), quality and clarity of your output, good modularity, good data organization (using data structures appropriately), and good programming style (are your identifier names descriptive, is your organization clea).
  
  You will receive appropriate partial credit for each stage you
  complete correctly. You will receive no credit for work on a later
  stage if the previous stages are incomplete or incorrect. The whole
  point of incremental development (i.e., stages) is to keep a
programmer from biting off more than he or she can chew.</p>

<p><strong>Statement of the problem:</strong> UCI has just started a
  program in hotel and restaurant management; its dean has established
  a small "bed and breakfast" hotel as a lab for the program's
  students. The dean has asked you to write the reservations software
  for this new inn, which will be called the Anteater BandB.</p>

<p>Your program will keep track of the rooms available for rent (these
  vary, since sometimes a room is closed for redecoration) and the
  reservations that guests have made for these rooms.</p>

<p>When the full Anteater BandB system is completed, it may have a
  graphical user interface, but for now your program will be a batch
  program; this means that you will read all of your input from an
  external data file and produce output as described below.</p>

<p>You could easily convert this program to an interactive one with a
  fancy user interface, where the program presents the user with a
  menu of commands, accepts the user's selection, prompts the user for
  whatever additional information the command requires, and then
  displays the results of that command. We made this assignment a
  batch program for three reasons: First, it's extra work for you to
  write the menu- printing and input-prompting commands, some of which
  you have already done in other assignments. It's easier simply to
  assume that the data appears in the correct format in the input
  files. Second, it gives you practice learning how to read data from
  external text files. Third, testing your program will be much easier
  when you can create files of test data rather than typing in each
  test interactively every time.</p>

<p>The input for this program comes from a single file, which
  consists of an unlimited number of input command lines. We will
  describe the various commands below; for each stage, you will
implement (or modify) a few more commands</p>
<p><strong>Stage I:</strong> For this stage, your program will keep
  track of the rooms that are available. This stage implements four
  commands, as described below. On each command line, the first two non-whitespace characters are the command, command letters may be upper or lower case.
<dl>
<dt>NB</dt> <dd>(for "add a new bedroom") followed by
an integer room number (in the range 1–999). Add a new bedroom with
the specified room number.</dd>
<dt>LB</dt><dd>(for "list bedrooms").  Print a list of the bedrooms currently available.
The input file may contain any number of these commands in any order;
    each LB command prints a list of available bedrooms based on what
    has been added as of that point. See the sample output below for
    the format of the printed bedroom list. For this stage, it doesn't
    matter what order the bedrooms appear in.</dd>
<dt>PL</dt><dd>(for "print line"), followed by any text. Simply print (or "echo") a line,
copying the input (not counting the PL and leading whitespace) to the output. You'll find it useful in testing, and it's also a simple way to make the program's reports clearer or fancier.</dd>
<dt>**</dt><dd>Comment, followed by any text. Like comments in a
    program, comment lines don't have any effect on the program's
    behavior; they just serve as annotations in the command
    file. </dd></dl>
Below is a sample input file for this stage.
<pre><code>** This is a sample command file for the Anteater BandB, Stage I
PL ***********************************************************
** A well-written program works gracefully with empty lists.
Lb
PL ***********************************************************
** Now let's add a bedroom:

    NB 201
    Nb      203
 LB
PL Thank you for using the Anteater BandB Reservation System!
** That's the end of the sample data for Stage I.
</code></pre>
From this input file, your program should produce the following
output:
<pre><code>***********************************************************
Here is a list of available bedrooms (before adding any!)
Number of bedrooms in service:  0
------------------------------------
***********************************************************

Number of bedrooms in service:  5
------------------------------------

203
Thank you for using the Anteater BandB Reservation System!</code></pre>
<strong>Stage II:</strong> Each stage of this assignment will
  continue to handle all the commands of the previous stages, of
  course. For this stage, your program will handle deletions from the
  list of available bedrooms.
<dl>
<dt>DB</dt><dd>(for "delete bedroom"), followed by a bedroom number.
Delete the specified room from the list.  Print an error message if
    the specified room isn't on the list.</dt></dl>
Here is some sample input for this stage:
<pre><code>** This is a sample command file for the Anteater BandB, Stage II
** First, add some bedrooms:
NB 301
nb 302
nb 303
** Now list what we have:
PL First list of available bedrooms:
LB
** Next, delete one:
DB 302
** And show the list reflecting the deletion:
PL List of available bedrooms after deleting one:
LB
** Try to delete a bedroom that doesn't exist, and get an error message.
DB 405
** Now add some more:
NB 302
NB 304
NB 305
PL List of available bedrooms:
LB
** We delete a bedroom ...
db   301
** ... we add another to the list.
NB 307
PL Another list, having deleted one and added another:
LB
PL Thank you for choosing the Anteater BandB Reservation System!
** That's the end of the sample data for Stage II.
</code></pre>
For the above input, your program should produce the following output:
<pre><code>First list of available bedrooms:
Number of bedrooms in service:  3
------------------------------------
301
302
303
List of available bedrooms after deleting one:
Number of bedrooms in service:  2

Thank you for choosing the Anteater BandB Reservation System!
</code></pre>
<strong>Stage III:</strong> For this stage, your program will keep
  track of reservations for specific rooms on specific dates. The
  first new command for this stage adds a reservation:
<dl>
<dt>NR</dt>
<dd>(followed by a bedroom number, then an arrival date in the form
  mm/dd/yyyy, then a departure date in the form mm/dd/yyyy, then the
  guest's name):  Add a new reservation for the specified room on the
  specified dates.
</dd></dl>
Your program will keep track of all the reservations.  An attempt
  to reserve a room that isn't on the list of available rooms should
  produce an error message. (Note that "available" means the same
  thing here that it has in the previous stages: Any room that is "in
  service," whether reserved by a guest or not, is "available." At
  this stage your program is not checking for occupied or free
  rooms.)</p>
  <p>At this stage, your program does not have to perform any checking that the dates are valid, nor does it have to identify conflicting reservations. Each new reservation prints and saves a unique "confirmation number" so the user can refer to it later (to cancel it, for example); this confirmation number should just be 1 for the first reservation added, 2 for the next, and so on, always increasing.</p>
<p>To make your coding task easier, import the Python
  library <code>datetime</code> and use it for date
  calculations. The <code>split</code> function with a <code>&quot;/&quot;</code> argument will be helpful, too.
</p>
<p>
Also handle these commands:
<dl><dt>LR</dt><dd>(for "list reservations").  Print all the reservations.</dd>
<dt>DR</dt><dd>(for "delete a reservation"), followed by the
    confirmation number of a reservation.  Deletes the specified
    reservation. If a DR command gives a confirmation number that isn't in the list of
  reservations, your program should produce an error message.
</dd>
</dl>
Here is some sample input for this stage.
  [It's a common temptation to use an elaborate test case like this one
  as the first test of your newly modified program. It's all right to
  indulge that temptation once, if you must; of course, your test will
  fail. Newly modified programs always have bugs. At that point,
  however, you should try a succession of smaller, more circumscribed
  tests, rather than ramming this same large test through the program
  over and over again until you finally force it through
  successfully. It's more productive, more thorough, and better
  organized in the long run to test each feature separately before
  going on to complex combinations. By the same token, however,
  adequate testing involves more than this single combination test
  case; this one case does not test everything that needs testing for
  this stage.]

<p><strong>Stage IV:</strong> In this stage, your program will check each command for various inconsistencies and impossible situations.</p>
<p>First, your program should reject any reservation whose arrival date
  is later than the departure date, or any reservation where the
  guest arrives and departs on the same day (we're running a
  respectable establishment). [Check the documentation for the
  <code>datetime</code> library for functions that help you with this.]</p>
<p>Your program must also check each reservation for a given bedroom
  for conflicts with any existing reservations for that bedroom; you
  can't rent the same room to two different guests on the same
  night. (Note, however, that one reservation can have the same
  arrival date as another reservation's departure date, since the
  departure date is the date the guest leaves, so the room is
  vacant that night.)</p>
<p>Next, your program should print an error message if the user
  attempts to add a bedroom with the same number as one that is
  already on the list.</p>
<p>
Finally, if the user deletes a bedroom, your program should cancel all
the reservations for that bedroom (printing an appropriate message for
each cancellation).</p>
<p>Here is some sample input for this stage:</p>
<pre><code>** This is a sample command file for the Anteater BandB, Stage IV

Thank you for abusing the Anteater BandB Reservation System!

<p><strong>Stage VI:</strong> This stage has two parts. First, the LB command should print the room list in order by room number and the LR command should list the reservations in order by arrival date. </p>
<p>The second part of this stage makes the file handling more
  realistic. In a real hotel, the room reservation system must save
  the reservation information at the end of the day, to be used as the
  following day's starting data. Before exiting, your program should
  write out the room and reservation information to an external file
  as a series of NB and NR commands, in the same format as the input
  command file. You should not automatically write the end-of-day data
  on top of the original input file; prompt the user for a new file
  name. Thereafter, when your program starts it will prompt the user
  for the file containing the previous day's ending data and read in
  those commands before it asks for the current day's command file and
  handles the commands there. In addition to the program's output for
  the four test cases you will turn in, you should also turn in a
  printed copy of the final end-of-day files for each of those four
  test cases.</p>

[In fact, there is an inconsistency here, because the NR command doesn't have space for an existing reservation's confirmation number. Thus, any carried-forward reservation will get a new confirmation number, and the number the guest has won't be any good. Optionally, propose a solution to this problem (you don't have to implement it, but it should be something you could implement if you had a few more days).]
<p><strong>Stage VII (optional): </strong>In this stage, before
cancelling a reservation you check to see if it can be moved to
  another room.  First check if there's another room free for the
entire duration of the reservation, and move it there.  If no single
room can accommodate the reservation, but if it could be split
between two rooms, do that.  Only if that's not possible,
cancel it.</p>
