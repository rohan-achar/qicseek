Dear Ezra and Melody,

This may be of interest to both of you. A Stropkov contact claiming descent 
from R' Ezriel Green and the Bnei Yissochur. His name is Hersh Klar and I met 
with him this afternoon. He gave permission to give out his phone number. He 
lives in Williamsburg at 718 384 5038. His cell is 646 739 4255. He said 
Mordche Friedman, his maternal grandfather, was born in around 1890's, lived 
in Stropkov and perished in the Holocaust. I do not see the family on the The 
Jews of Stropkov, 1942-1945: Their Names, Their Fate webpage at
http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/stropkov1/str001.html
His grandfather:Ezriel Friedman, son of Mordche and Shaindel. Mordche's mother 
was Hinde Golda. 

I do know that R' Pesach Avrohm Schonfeld, son-in-law of R' Ezriel Green, was ABD 
Kurima. He had a son-in-law named Moshe Baum from Stropkov. Perhaps that is his 
connection. Any ideas or thoughts?

By the way, let me introduce you to each other. Ezra Holczer is researching R' 
Ezriel Green. Melody Amsel is researching Stropkov. Hersh Klar is my cousin through 
Pesach Langsam. He is even more closely related through my maternal (Yurowitz) line.

Any ideas as to his ancestry to R' Hersh Mylech Spira, the Bnei Yissochur?

L'shana Tova!

PS: Hersh, can you tell us the family name of R' Mordche's wife, Shaindel?
