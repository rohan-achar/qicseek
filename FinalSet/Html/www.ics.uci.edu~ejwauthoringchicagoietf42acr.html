<h1>WebDAV Advanced Collections Protocol</h1>
<H2>42nd IETF, 27 August 1998<BR>
Jim Davis</H2>

These are the slides as presented at the WebDAV WG at the 42nd IETF in
Chicago by Jim Davis.  These slides reflect corrections made during
discussion.  The presentation included a design for direct references
that was created by two of the authors (Davis and Whitehead) during
the week.  This design is not documented in the current ID.

<H2>Terminology</h2>

<UL>
<LI><B>Referential Resource</B>:  A resource that has no content of its own, but rather is a reference to another resource</LI>
<LI><B>Ordinary Resource</B>: A resource that is not a reference to another resource</LI>
<LI><B>Target Resource</B>:  The resource referenced by a referential member of a collection</LI>
<LI><B>Direct Reference</B>: A reference that has the property that operations on it are passed through to its target</LI>
<LI><B>Indirect Reference</B>: A reference that has the property that operations on it do not affect its target</LI>
<LI><B>Strong Reference</B>:  A reference whose referential integrity is guaranteed by the server</LI>
<LI><B>Weak Reference</B>:  A reference whose referential integrity is not guaranteed by the server</LI></UL>

<H2>Scope of This Specification</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Direct and weak indirect and references are supported</LI>
<LI>Headers and properties are designed to be extensible</LI>
<LI>Allow future support for strong references</LI></UL>

<H2>Referential Resource</h2>

Has four properties
<ul>
<li>resourcetype = dav:reference
<li>reftarget (new) = URL of target resource.
<li>reftype (new) = dav:direct or dav:indirect
<li>refintegrity (new) = dav:weak or dav:strong
</ul>

<H2>New HTTP headers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ref-Type
<li>Ref-Target
</ul>
<H2>New methods</h2>
<ul>
<li>MKREF
<li>DELREF
</ul>
<H2>New properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>on reference resource:
<ul>
<li>reftarget - URL of target resource.
<li>reftype - dav:direct or dav:indirect
<li>refintegrity - dav:weak or dav:strong
</ul>
<li>on target resource:
<ul>
<li>references - list of URLs of targets.
</ul>
</ul>


<H2>Operations on Indirect Reference</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Redirected:</LI>
<ul>
<li>GET, HEAD, PUT, POST</LI>
</ul>
<LI>Affect reference:</LI>
<ul>
<li>PROPPATCH, PROPFIND, DELREF, DELETE, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, </LI>
</ul>
<LI>Passed to target:</LI>
<ul>
<li>none</LI>
</ul>
</UL>

<H2>Operations on Direct Reference</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Redirected:</LI>
<ul>
<li>None
</ul>
<LI>Affect reference:</LI>
<ul>
<li>DELREF, DELETE, COPY, MOVE
</ul>
<LI>Passed to target:</LI>
<ul>
<li>GET*, HEAD*, PUT, POST, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK
<li>*except Ref-Type and Ref-Target headers are added
</ul>
</UL>

<H2>Creating Referential Resources</H2>

[Request]
<PRE>
MKREF /~whitehead/dav/spec08.ref HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Ref-Target: http://www.ics.uci.edu/i-d/draft-webdav-protocol-08.txt
Ref-Type: &lt;dav:indirect&gt;
</PRE>

[Response]
<PRE>
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
</PRE>

<H2>Deleting Referential Resources</H2>

[Request]
<PRE>
DELREF /~whitehead/dav/spec08.ref HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
</PRE>

[Response]
<PRE>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</PRE>

<H2>Operations on Target Resources</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Operations on targets of weak, indirect references have no effect on the referential resource</LI>
<LI>Operations on targets of direct references:
<ul>
<li>DELETE deletes all references</LI>
<LI>MOVE updates ref-target of references</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</ul>

<H2>Security issue:</H2>

<P>MOVE of target T to a new, secret place reveals location to reference R</P>
<P>Solution: COPY it, then DELETE.</P></DIR>

<H2>Issues</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Owner of T should be able to prevent creation of direct references</LI>
<LI>References should have distinct ACL from target.</LI>
<LI>Cross-server reference acts like a proxy.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Ordered Collections</H2>

Not presented, for lack of time.
