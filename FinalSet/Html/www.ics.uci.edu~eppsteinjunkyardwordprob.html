A Word-Problem:

Let  G = &lt; a,b | aabb=baba, bbaa=abab &gt;  the free group of
two generators a and b with the two relations aabb=baba and bbaa=abab.

Show that  aaabbb unequal bababa.

I've tried all homomorphisms from G to S10 without success.
(e.g.  a-&gt;(123), b-&gt;(142)  shows  ab unequal ba  but  aaabbb=bababa)

...which suggests several questions:

1) Where does this specific word-problem come from?  Perhaps trying to
prove that no rectangle of odd area can be tiled with L-triominos if
only two orientations (related by 180-degree rotation) are allowed?

2) Now that we have a group-theoretic proof, is there an elementary
proof of the same result about tilings?  Note that if all four orientations
(or even three of the four orientations) are allowed then a 5x9 rectangle
can be tiled with L-triominos.

3) How did David Sibley find the two premutations above?  Could they
be affine linear transformations on a 5-dimensional vector space over
Z/2?  The cycle structures (4)(4)(12)(12) of both A and B are compatible
with this guess.

The group  G = &lt; a, b : a^2*b^2=(b*a)^2, b^2*a^2=(a*b)^2 &gt;  is soluble:

Let  K  be the subgroup generated by  p = a*b  and  q = b*a .
This subgroup is normal,  with quotient  G/K  cyclic
(NB:  p^a = q,  p^b = p^-1*q^2,  q^a = q^-1*p^2,  &amp;  q^b = p ).

Let  L  be the subgroup generated by  u = p^3  and  v = q^3 .
This subgroup too is normal (with  u^a = v = u^b  and  v^a = u = v^b ),
and also Abelian (since in fact both p and q centralize both u and v).

Further, the quotient  K/L  is a homomorphic image of the (3,3,3) triangle
group  &lt; p, q : p^3 = q^3 = (p*q)^3 = 1 &gt;,  which is Abelian-by-cyclic,
and is therefore soluble.

Now since  G/K is cyclic,  K/L is soluble,  and  L is Abelian, 
it follows that  G itself is soluble.

Here's a finite matrix representation of  G  over GF(2):

  A = [ 0  1  0  0  0 ]            B = [ 1  0  1  1  0 ]
      [ 0  0  1  0  0 ]                [ 0  0  1  0  0 ]
      [ 1  0  0  0  0 ]                [ 1  0  0  0  0 ]
      [ 0  0  0  1  0 ]                [ 1  1  1  0  0 ]
      [ 0  0  0  0  1 ]                [ 0  0  0  0  1 ]

  A^3*B^3 = [ 0  1  1  1  0 ]      B^3*A^3 = [ 0  1  1  1  0 ]
            [ 1  0  1  1  0 ]                [ 1  0  1  1  0 ]
            [ 1  1  0  1  0 ]                [ 1  1  0  1  0 ]
            [ 1  1  1  0  0 ]                [ 1  1  1  0  0 ]
            [ 0  0  0  1  1 ]                [ 1  1  1  0  1 ]

  (A^3*B^3)^2 = (B^3*A^3)^2 = [ 1  0  0  0  0 ]
                              [ 0  1  0  0  0 ]
                              [ 0  0  1  0  0 ]
                              [ 0  0  0  1  0 ] 
                              [ 1  1  1  1  1 ] 
							  
These matrices generate a factor group of order 96, with centre of order 2,
and clearly isomorphic to a subgroup of AGL(4,2).

This is the problem the word-problem comes from:

                   1
                  1 1
                 2 2 3
                3 2 3 3
               3 3 1 1 2
              1 2 2 1 2 2
             1 1 2 3 3 1 1
            2 3 3 1 3 2 1 3
           2 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3
                                                            o
This figure shows that you can tile a triangle T9 with T2: o o

QUESTION: which T(n) can be tiled with T2?

SOLUTION:
 The number of points of T(n) is ( n+1 \choose 2 ) = t(n).
 3 | t(n)  iff  n = 0, 2 (mod 3).

 CASE I: if n = 0, 2, 9, 11 (mod 12) then T(n) is tileable.
   From T9 you can get T11 and T12 adding:

      1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1
     1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1

   or
      1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2
     2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1
    2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1

   With T11, T12, and k times

     1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2

   you can construct T(n+12) from T(n).

 CASE II: if n = 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 12) then T(n) is not tileable.
   This is the hard case. You can look at the equivalent triomino
   puzzle. In this case T5 would look like:

              o                The allowed L-triominoes are:
            o o                      o         o o
          o o o   = T5             o o   and   o
        o o o o
      o o o o o                (only 180-degree rotation)

   Now let's try group theory:
   You can read about this technique in the article:
     Dmitry V. Fomin, Getting it together with "polyominoes",
     quantum 2:2 (Nov/Dec 1991) 20-23, 61
   So you get the group: G = &lt; a, b| aabb=baba, bbaa=abab &gt;.
   If a^n b^n &lt;&gt; (ba)^n for n = 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 12) then is T(n) not
   tileable. Is a^n b^n = (ba)^n for some n = 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 12) then
   a^3 b^3 = (ba)^3. This you can see be the same technique as in CASE I.
   You have the additional possibility of reduction in the group. If you
   show a^3 b^3 &lt;&gt; (ba)^3 then CASE II is solved. David Sibley found a
   homomorphism, which shows this inequality. So CASE II is proofed.

Annotation:
  Noam Elkies is right, that the homomorphis of David Sibley shows that
  it is implossible to tile an odd rectangle with the L-triomino (only
  180-degree rotation allowed) too. In this case you have to show that
  a^3 b &lt;&gt; b a^3.

So it was a tiling problem, but not the one I had imagined...

"  Noam Elkies is right, that the homomorphism of David Sibley shows that
"  it is impossible to tile an odd rectangle with the L-triomino (only
"  180-degree rotation allowed) too. In this case you have to show that
"  a^3 b &lt;&gt; b a^3.

I omitted a step here: the commutators [a^3,b^2] and [b^2,a^3] vanish
(aaabb=a(aabb)=a(baba)=(abab)a=(bbaa)a=bbaaa, and likewise aabbb=bbbaa;
in ffect I'm tiling 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles with the allowed L-triominos),
and aaabbb=bababa iff a^3 and b^3 commute since b(abab)a=b(bbaa)a;
so the group-theory identity [a^m,b^n]=1 that would result from a tiling
of any odd mxn rectangle by allowed L-triominos is equivalent to any of
[aaa,b]=1, [aaa,bbb]=1, or aaabbb=bababa.

I love and use your junkyard site frequently!
Looking for a remembered result I found it at
 <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/wordprob.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/wordprob.html</A>

Halfway down one finds:

which MAPLE shows is wrong. Actually, for A and B
