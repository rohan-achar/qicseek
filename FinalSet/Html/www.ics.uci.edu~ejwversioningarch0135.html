How do the following rules of thumb sound?

- If an activity involves only modifying a current
  state, with no regard for prior history, then
  it is "distributed authoring", and belongs on
  w3c-dist-auth.

- If an activity involves prior history, such as
  dealing with a particular revision, or requiring
  metadata related to a change sequence, it is
  "versioning" and belongs on www-vers-wg.

- If an activity involves querying or metadata
  that is not directly related to a revision history,
  then it is "document management" and belongs on
  www-vers-wg.

I'd hope that authoring activities will turn
out to be independent of whether one is also
doing versioning activities, and that versioning
may turn out to be a relatively simple (and
hopefully standardizable :-) instance of
document management techniques.

Note that these categories are independent of
the activity involving one or multiple resources,
or being accomplished through one or multiple
requests.
