Fall Quarter 2012 &mdash; <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/"> Information and Computer Sciences</A> &mdash; <A HREF="http://www.uci.edu/">UC Irvine</A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Lab Tutor Seminar (ICS 193)</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>COURSE REFERENCE</B></FONT></P>
<P><B>Instructors:</B> <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/">David G. Kay</A> (<code>kay@uci.edu</code>),
5056 Donald Bren Hall; <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/">Rich Pattis</a> (<code>pattis@uci.edu</code>), 4062 Donald Bren Hall</P>
<P> <B></B><B>Tutor coordinators:</B> Andrea Lau (<code>laua3@uci.edu</code>) and Alan Chang (<code>alchang1@uci.edu</code>)</P>
<P><B>Meeting time and place:</B>  Section A: Tuesdays 3:30 to 4:50 in 1423 DBH; Section B: Wednesdays 2:00 to 3:20 in 1425 DBH. We may not meet every week later in the quarter.</P>
<P><B>Course requirements:</B>  It's simple: Everyone can get an A who performs professionally. Unprofessional things (like missing scheduled lab sessions or missing the ICS 193 meetings) will lower the grade and pretty quickly result in a tutor being asked not to be a tutor any more. Of course real emergencies come up (but normal academic obligations like midterms and projects aren't real emergencies; you can plan around them); in a real emergency, contact the coordinators and the TA of your section as soon as you possibly can.</P>
<P>
<B>Topics to be covered:</B>  Primarily we will discuss issues that have come up or may come up in your tutoring. We will talk some about teaching in general, and we will also cover relevant aspects of Python and other computer science principles.</P>

<!--If you don&#39;t have an assigned office (or
prefer not to hold your scheduled office hours there), you may use a designated
room in the Computer Science Trailer (where the ICS Student Affairs Office
is).  Eventually workstations and a printer may be installed there, which
you may use for grading and class preparation; there is no keycard mechanism
to charge for use of this printer.  To schedule times in this room, check
with Bing Barcega (<A HREF="mailto:bbarcega@uci.edu">bbarcega@uci.edu</A>).</FONT></P>
