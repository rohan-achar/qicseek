<H1>Labyrinth Tiling</H1>

Many
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/tiling.html">tilings</A>,
including the famous
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/penrose.html">Penrose tiling</A>,
are generated by a subdivision process of the following sort:
starting with a single tile from a given finite set, repeatedly
replace each tile by a collection of smaller tiles, drawn from the same set.
For instance, starting with a square, and repeatedly dividing each square into four,
produces the standard square tiling by a process closely related to the construction
of the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gina/quadtree.html">quadtree</A>
geometric data structure.
<P>
Another subdivision tiling can be formed by tiles of two types:
equilateral triangles, and 30-30-120 isosceles triangles.
The equilateral triangle can be subdivided into three congruent isosceles triangles
by connecting each vertex to the center of the triangle.  And the isosceles triangle
can be subdivided into two similar isosceles triangles and an
equilateral triangle, all three having the same area, by trisecting its
hypotenuse and connecting the resulting points to the opposite vertex.
The following image shows several levels of this subdivision process,
with the triangles at each level scaled to have the same area.
<P>

<P>
Repeating this subdivision and scaling process produces an infinite
tiling of the plane (or actually a family of different tilings) which
I call the "labyrinth tilings" for reasons to
be made clear below.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="tiling.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
At first glance, this tiling looks quite uniform: it is formed by a
regular pattern of 60-120 rhombuses, each subdivided by a diagonal into
two triangles.  The only variation occurs in the choice of which diagonal to use.
Nevertheless we will see that this tiling has quite an interesting
aperiodic structure.

<H2>Position Coding</H2>

For many aperiodic tilings, one can prove aperiodicity by considering
the ratios in which the different kinds of tiles are used.  If these
ratios are irrational, the tiling is aperiodic.  For instance
the occurrence in the Penrose tiling of the golden ratio shows that it
is aperiodic.  Unfortunately, this does not work for our labyrinth
tilings: the isosceles and equilateral triangles occur in the ratio 3:1.
We need to prove aperiodicity a different way.  We will do so using a
method for using certain sequences to encode the positions of triangles
in the tiling.
<P>
Note that from any step <I>k</I> in the subdivision process that forms the tiling,
there is only one way of reversing the process and recovering the tiling
at step <I>k</I>-1.  For, any equilateral triangle at step <I>k</I> must
have exactly two isosceles neighbors (and one equilateral neighbor);
this equilateral triangle and pair of isosceles neighbors forms a larger
isosceles triangle at step <I>k</I>-1.  The remaining isosceles
triangles form triples meeting at their obtuse angles, which form larger
equilateral triangles at step <I>k</I>-1.  From the triangles at step <I>k</I>-1
we can recover those at step <I>k</I>-2, and so on.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="poscode.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
Define the <I>position code</I> of each triangle in a labyrinth tiling
to be the infinite sequence of shapes and orientations of these larger and larger
triangles at previous levels of the subdivision.
<P>
The position code of a single triangle determines the arrangement of
triangles in all neighborhoods of the triangle, and therefore determines
the overall labyrinth tiling.
Two triangles belong to the same tiling when their position codes
differ in only a finite number of places.
(There are also some cases when two points separated by an infinite ray
of a tiling can have position codes differing in infinitely many places.)
<P>
The existence of these position codes shows that any labyrinth tiling is aperiodic.
For, any point in the triangle belongs to a unique triangle at any previous level
<I>j</I>&lt;<I>k</I> of the subdivision process.  In particular we can choose
<I>j</I> so that the triangle is larger than any given period of
translational symmetry.  No point within this large triangle can be
taken to any other point in the triangle by a translational symmetry.
So no such symmetry can exist, and the tiling is aperiodic.  (Note that,
just as in the case of the Penrose tilings, a finite number of
rotational symmetries may still exist).

<H2>Labyrinths</H2>

The edges in the labyrinth tilings lie at six different slopes,
at 30 degree angles to each other.  If we look at only those edges which
are horizontal or vertical, an interesting pattern emerges.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="labyrinth.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
These edges seem to mark out the boundaries of a
space-filling labyrinth that covers the entire plane.
(The labyrinths of the ancients, unlike modern mazes, were typically
<I>unicursal</I>, having
neither branches nor dead ends [<A HREF="phillips.html">Phillips</A>].)
Because of the tiling's six-fold symmetry, this labyrinth is overlaid
with two others, at 30 and 60 degree angles to it.
<P>
These patterns can be explained using position codes.
It turns out that,
given any two points in the tiling, either
an infinite horizontal or vertical ray in the tiling crosses the line
segment between them, or there is a unique sequence of triangles that forms a path
connecting them and is not crossed by any horizontal or vertical edges.
<P>
To prove this, look at the position codes of the two points.
Eventually the large triangles in the codes get so large that there is
only room for two possible configurations: either the two points are in
a single large triangle, or they are in two adjacent triangles.
<P>
If the two points are in adjacent triangles at all the infinitely many levels
of the position codes, and if those triangles are always separated by a
horizontal or vertical segment, then these segments combine to form an
infinite horizontal or vertical ray or line.  In this case, this line
may separate the points from each other.
<P>
Otherwise, at some level <I>j</I>
of the subdivision process, the path we are looking for connecting the two points
consists simply of these one or two triangles from the position codes of
the two points.
We now show that each level of the subdivision process preserves the
existence of these paths.  To do this, we use a slightly modified version of the
subdivision process that ends up tiling a larger area than the original triangles.
At each step, we follow the usual subdivisions described above, except that
if the resulting area has an isosceles triangle hypotenuse on its boundary that
is neither vertical nor horizontal, we add the matching triangle on the
other side of that edge.  Because of this addition, all isosceles
triangles with slanted hypotenuses can be assumed to form matched pairs.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="hvsubdiv.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
As can be seen above, if before the subdivision a set of triangles is
crossed by a path of triangles (connected to each other by slanted edges),
a modified version of the same path will wind through the same region
after the subdivision.  Therefore there is a single
path covering a region surrounding the two given points, which produces the unique path connecting the points that I claimed existed.
