Incremental Cycle Detection, Topological Ordering, and Strong Component

<p>
This paper deals with maintaining the topological order for a directed
<i>n</i>-vertex acyclic graph as arcs are added to the graph as well as
detecting a cycle when one is created by adding a new arc.  There are
two algorithms described in the paper, the first dealing with <i>m</i>
arc additions in O(<i>m</i><sup>3/2</sup>) time.  This algorithm
improves the previous best bound by a logarithmic factor for sparse
networks and is within a constant factor among other algorithms
satisfying a natural locality property.  The second algorithm has an
upper bound of O(<i>n</i><sup>5/2</sup>) time and a lower bound of
&Omega;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>2<sup>&radic;2&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i></sup>)
obtained by relating its performance to a generalization of
the <i>k</i>-levels problem of combinatorial geometry.
