<h2>
W3 has come to stand for a number of things,
which should be distinguished.  These include
<ul>
<li> The idea of a boundless information world in which all items have a
reference by which they can be retrieved;
<li> The address system (URI) ... implemented to make this possible,
despite many different protocols;
<li>A network protocol (HTTP) ... giving performance and features
not otherwise available;
<li>A markup language (HTML)... used for the transmission
of basic things ...
across the net;
<li> The body of data available on the Internet using all or some of the
preceding listed items.
</ul>
