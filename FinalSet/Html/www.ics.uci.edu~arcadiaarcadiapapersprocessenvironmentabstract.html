"<B>Process-Centered Environments (Only) Support Environment-Centered
Processes</B>"</A>, by Alexander L. Wolf and David S. Rosenblum
in <I>Proceedings of the Eighth International Software Process Workshop
(ISPW8)</I>, pages 148-149, Wadern, Germany, March 1993.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

The software process research community has concentrated a large measure of
its effort on the problem of how to "computerize" the software process.
In particular, the notion of a process-centered environment has emerged,
dominating software environment research for the past several years.  Among
the many benefits touted for process-centered environments are the ability to
automate various aspects of a process and the ability to monitor the progress
of a process in order to guide, enforce, or measure that process.  This
approach has shown great promise and indeed has even shown some early
successes.  Unfortunately, this emphasis on computerization in general, and
on process-centered environments in particular, tends to focus attention on
exactly those aspects of process that can be computerized, while giving short
shrift to those aspects not amenable to computerization.
