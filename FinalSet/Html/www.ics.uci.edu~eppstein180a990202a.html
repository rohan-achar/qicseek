<H2>Lecture notes for February 2, 1999<BR>
Forcing progress in Winning Positions</H2>

If the game reaches a point where a win can be forced,
alpha-beta search will find it.  But, paradoxically, making a winning move at each turn 
is not always enough to win the game.  The problem is in games like 
checkers or chess, one can make a sequence of moves that each lead to a 
forced win, but that don't cause the win to get any closer.

<P>For example, consider the following chess position:
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="990202a.gif" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=292
ALT="White: Kd6, Qa7; Black: Ke8"></CENTER>

<P>White to move can win immediately by moving the queen to square e7,
checkmating the black queen.  But white also has other moves that win more 
slowly; in fact there is only one move white can make that does not win.
For instance, suppose white moves his king to e6; black's only moves are d8 
and f8, after either of which white still has a checkmate possible.
If black moves to d8, white can still win by moving back to d6.
But after the sequence of moves 1. Ke6 Kd8 2. Kd6 Ke8 we are back where we 
started!  White is making winning moves, but he isn't making progress to a 
win.

<P>If an alpha-beta search gives the same evaluation to any winning 
position, it can easily fall into this trap.  To prevent this, we need to 
change the evaluation of winning positions, so that a win in fewer moves 
is counted slightly better than a delayed win.  The code is 
straightforward: if we keep a variable "ply" denoting how far the current 
position is from the root of the search, we can adjust the score for a 
winning position by subtracting the ply.  The following pseudocode assumes 
that we have defined a constant "WIN" which refers to the maximum score 
possible in a game (in chess, a typical value for WIN would be 100 or 1000 times 
the value of a pawn).

<PRE>
    // Alpha-beta search with WIN scores adjusted for ply

    int ply;    // global variable initialized to zero at start of search
    int alphabeta(int depth, int alpha, int beta)
    {
        if (game over and current player has won) return WIN - ply;
        else if (game over and current player has lost) return -WIN + ply;
        else if (depth <= 0) return eval();
        ply++;
        for (each possible move m) {
            make move m;
            alpha = max(alpha, -alphabeta(depth - 1, -beta, -alpha);
            unmake move m;
            if (alpha >= beta) break;
        }
        ply--;
        return alpha;
    }
</PRE>

Now in the example above, the immediate checkmate is seen at ply=1,
and gets a score of 999 (WIN-1), while moving the king to e8 forces a win 
at ply=3, with a score of 997.  The program will move to the position 
maximizing its score, and take the immediate checkmate.

<P>For some games, such as Othello, there is a natural limit to the length of 
the game: each move adds a piece to the board, so there can be at most 64 
moves before the game finishes.  For those games, there is no way to get 
into the same sort of infinite loop, and we can just use a score of WIN 
or -WIN without worrying about the ply adjustment.

<P>
There is one further complication with this ply adjustment trick: how does 
it interact with the hash table?  The problem is that the ply may differ 
between the time we store a move in the hash table, and the time we 
retrieve it. In order to make the retrieved score's ply adjustment correct, 
we should store scores in the hash table adjusted relative to the 
<I>current</I> position, rather than the position at the root of the 
search.

<P>That is, when storing a position in the hash table,
use something like the following pseudocode,
where MAX_PLY is a constant defined to be greater than the maximum depth 
possible in a search (WIN=1000 and MAX_PLY=100 might be reasonable).
The variable x is just the index of the current position in the hash table.
<PRE>
    if (score > WIN - MAX_PLY) hash[x].score = score + ply;
    else if (score < -WIN + MAX_PLY) hash[x].score = score - ply;
    else hash[x].score = score;
</PRE>

<P>When retrieving a position from the hash table, the opposite adjustment 
needs to be made:
<PRE>
    if (hash[x].score > WIN - MAX_PLY) score = hash[x].score - ply;
    else if (hash[x].score < -WIN + MAX_PLY) score = hash[x].score + ply;
    else score = hash[x].score;
</PRE>
