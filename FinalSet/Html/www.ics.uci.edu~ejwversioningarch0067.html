Please get comments back to me by Wednesday morning (EDT), if you
want them incorporated before I ship something off to the IETF as
an internet draft Thursday afternoon.

    <TITLE>Functional Requirements for Specifying Document Revision
      Information in HTTP URLs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Before attempting to develop a convention for recording
      document version information in HTTP URLs, we must decide
      on the functional requirements that such a notation must,
      and must <em>not</em>, satisfy.  Such a requirements
      analysis will allow the working group to quickly elminate
      those proposed notations that clearly fail to satisfy the
      requirements, and discuss the relative merits of the
      (hopefully several) contenders left in the light of a
      common framework.</p>
    <p>The requirements listed in this document were condensed
      from the discussions held on the
      <a href="mailto:www-vers-wg@ics.UCI.EDU">WWW Versioning
        Working Group.</a></p>
    <h1>Rationale</h1>
    <p>Before starting in to the development of the requirements
      of any notation for embedding version information in URLs,
      the first question must be, "Is there a requirement that we
      be able to do so?"  While the research group at NTT
      expressed some concern at the group's assumption that such
      a capability was necessary, the general concensus has been
      that the ability to embed hypertextual links to historical
      versions of documents is valuable.</p>
    <p>Given that we want to be able to link to historical
      revisions of a document, there are two routes open to us:
      extend HTML to provide a way to store the information,
      perhaps as a new attribute for the HTML <code>A</code> tag; or
      embed such information in the URL itself.  While the former
      method is conceptually more in keeping with the SGML way of
      doing things, it does have the drawback that existing Web
      clients will be unable to access the information in any
      meaningful way.  Thus, we are limited to embedding version
      control information in the HTTP URL itself.</p>
    <h1>Requirements and Anti-Requirements</h1>
    <p>As well as listing the requirements that any
      notation must satisfy, it's useful to provide a list of
      anti-requirements.  Anti-requirements describe
      functionality that the notation is explicity not
      required to support or, more strongly, is required to not
      support.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>The version information is opaque to the client.</dt>
      <dd>Because the notation will be required to operate in the
        version control environment prefered by the website
        maintainer, it must be able to properly contain arbitrary
        strings, which may be used by the VCS as version
        identifiers.  While the version information will be
        explicable to the human operator, and perhaps to
        special-purpose clients, in the general case, we must
        assume that the client treats the URL as a black box.</dd>
      <dt>It is not necessary to be able to decompose a URL into
        its consitutent resource URL and version identifier.</dt>
      <dd>URLs have been defined as "magic cookies" that HTTP
        servers use to identify resources.  Clients cannot, in
        general, decode a URL to determine how a server would
        interpret it.</dd>
      <dt>Given a resource URL and a version identifier,
        version-aware clients must be able to construct a URL.</dt>
      <dd>While existing URLs cannot be decomposed, the ability
        to construct a URL is essential for version-aware
        clients.  This requirement parallels the ability of
        clients to submit queries against a page.</dd>
      <dt>Any new notation must not cause problems for existing
        pages.</dt>
      <dd>Roughly, this means that the notation cannot cause a
        version-aware server to interpret a pre-existing URL in a
        new way.  For example, stating that version
        information is appended to a resource URL as a "special
        query", using the "?" URL syntax, will cause problems for
        existing forms that contain a "version" field.</dd>
      <dt>The version notation is not a configuration notation.</dt>
      <dd>The functionality provided by the basic version
        notation allows for the specification of a given revision
        of a single resource.  The ability to "surf into the
        past", which requires the ability to retrieve the correct
        revisions of <strong>all</strong> of the embedding images
        and linked pages, may be (should be able to be?) built on
        top of the versioning URL notation.</dd>
