<H1>Minutes</H1>


<P>
Editor's note: These minutes are the result of merging notes taken
by Dennis Hamilton, Keith Dawson, and Jim Whitehead.  In particular,
the detailed, comprehensive notes taken by Dennis Hamilton form the
core of this material. These original notes were edited to make them
more readable in a standalone document, and to add context so that
people who did not attend the meeting could still understand the
discussion. Thus, text attributed to individuals should not be
interpreted as a direct transcription of what they said in the
meeting, but rather as a representation of their content or position,
consistent with what was actually spoken.
</P>

<H2>Morning - 9AM</H2>

<P>
The meeting began with all present introducing themselves, and
stating their organization.
</P>

<H3>History of Distributed Web Authoring - Whitehead</H3>

<P>
Whitehead gave a presentation on the history of distributed web
authoring.  The first web authoring tool was the Nexus browser
(1989/1990), the Next machine browser/editor developed by Tim
Berners-Lee.  In 1992, the Mosaic 2.4 browser achieved critical
mass, and created the &quot;publish/browse&quot; technical frame
of reference for the WWW. In 1992, the HTTP PUT method disappeared
from the HTTP 1.0 specification because this specification was
intended to reflect the practices of existing HTTP servers, which
did not have write capability. In 1994/95, development took place
on NaviPress/NaviServer (now AOLpress/AOLserver), Vermeer (now
Microsoft) FrontPage, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Line Mode Browser, the first generation of distributed web authoring
tools.
</P>

<P>
In December, 1994, there was a breakout session on distributed
web authoring tools at the WWW4 conference.  The focus of this
session was how to achieve interoperability among distributed
web authoring tools.  This session identified the following interoperability
issues: common access control model, &quot;lost update&quot; problem,
need for BROWSE and MKDIR HTTP methods, editing of variants, access
to &quot;raw&quot; HTML before server-side include (SSI) processing,
strong authentication, and placing a link to the HTML Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML) Document Type Description (DTD)
in the HTML source.
</P>

<P>
In 1995/96, Rohit Khare at W3C researched a resource leasing and
locking mechanism.  In March 1996, Dan Connolly of the W3C put
out a call for volunteers to coordinate distributed authoring
activity, and Jim Whitehead of U.C. Irvine volunteered, forming
the Working Group on Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web,
and the Working Group on Versioning and Configuration Management
of World Wide Web Content.  Though Whitehead received much appreciated
assistance from Dan Connolly of the W3C, and Larry Masinter of
the IETF HTTP Working Group, neither the distributed authoring
or the versioning and configuration management group has official
sponsorship from either the W3C or the IETF.
</P>

<P>
In June, 1996, the IETF HTTP Working Group completed an internet
draft of HTTP version 1.1, including a PUT (write) method.  In
July 1996, the IETF HTTP working group completed an internet draft
on digest authentication for HTTP.  On July 10, 1996, the Working
Group on Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web met at AOL
Productions, San Mateo, California.
</P>

<H3>Working Group Descriptions and Purposes - Whitehead</H3>

<P>
Whitehead next gave a presentation stating the best current description
of the purpose and activities of the Working Group on Distributed
Authoring on the World Wide Web, and the Working Group on Versioning
and Configuration Management of World Wide Web Content.  Whitehead
stated that the mission of the distributed authoring group is
to make distributed authoring as pervasive as browsing is today.
 This could be achieved by specifying preliminary modifications
to existing internet specification (e.g. HTTP), and by establishing
usage conventions (e.g., URL naming conventions).  These preliminary
specification and usage conventions would then be forwarded to
appropriate bodies, such as the IETF HTTP Working Group, for final
discussion and potential incorporation into existing internet
standards. <I>(Further discussion of this issue took place in
the afternoon.)</I>
</P>

<P>
The Working Group on Distributed Authoring has a home page at
URL:

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/" ><B>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/</B></A>

<P>

It also has a mailing list, <I>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org" ><I>w3c-dist-auth@w3.org</I></A>&gt;</I>,

hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium.

<P>

At this point there was some discussion about membership on the

mailing list.  Whitehead stated that he hasn't yet turned down

anyone who wanted to join the list, and he wants high participation

on the list. However, it is a managed list. Whitehead wants the

ability to gag (after warning) list participants who are not behaving

constructively. Masinter stated that this is a perilous course,

that it is better to just leave the list open and be selective

in reading and responding. 

<P>

There was some discussion about the differences between W3C mailing

lists, which do not have to have open membership, and IETF working

group mailing lists, which do.

<P>

Masinter: Irrespective of whether the mailing list is open or

restricted, gagging on an individual basis just doesn't work out.

I suggest having solid guidelines about the list and what is expected

of participation, and have that known in advance. 

<P>

Whitehead: We will discuss membership and sponsorship further

later today. 

<P>

Masinter: You need to decide on sponsorship of this working group

so that the participants who are concerned about legal questions

(e.g., anti-trust and intellectual property rights) around participating

with others can be satisfied and operate appropriately.

<P>

The Working Group on Versioning and Configuration Management of

World Wide Web Content has as its goal the development of a preliminary

specification for how to provide versioning and configuration

management of content served by an HTTP server.  This goal can

be achieved through the same means used by the distributed authoring

group: extension of existing specifications, and establishment

of usage conventions.  While the issues considered by the distributed

authoring group also include versioning and configuration management,

the versioning group was created as a sub-group of the distributed

authoring group to partition the issue space due to the complexity

and number of issues involved.

<P>

The Working Group on Versioning and Configuration Management has

a home page at URL:

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/" ><B>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/</B></A>

<P>

It also has a mailing list, <I>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:www-vers-wg-request@ics.uci.edu" ><I>www-vers-wg@ics.uci.edu</I></A>&gt;</I>,

hosted by the Department of Information and Computer Science at

the University of California, Irvine.

<P>

Seiwald: Is it possible to separate issues of versioning and configuration

management from distributed authoring, and how do we reconcile

different interests?

<P>

Whitehead: There is significant overlap between the two issue

spaces. For example, access control is considered by both groups.

 However, due to the size of the versioning and configuration

management issue space, and the different set of parties interested

in this issue, such as configuration management companies, it

makes sense to have a separate group address this issue.  There

will be close collaboration between the two groups, and there

is currently significant overlap in membership.

<P>

Hamilton: The issue spaces aren't orthogonal, but we want to factor

these topics (collaboration, versioning, authoring) so that we

can proceed in parallel as much as possible. 

<P>

Seiwald made a comment about configuration management being a

result of cooperative authoring and how versioning and authoring

don't get too far apart.<BR>



<P>

Fein asked about previous work on collaborative editing and the

WWW.

<P>

Nielsen: There has been some discussion about collaboration in

other groups, and there was a workshop on the subject. <BR>



<P>

Masinter: What are people interested in? 

<P>

At this point we went around the room and reviewed what people

were interested in.<BR>



<P>

Question: Have any of the people from Netscape Navigator Gold

been asked to participate in this meeting?  Long had some contact

but it seems to have gone quiet at his end at the moment.  Whitehead

mentioned that Netscape was contacted prior to the meeting, but

had declined to participate. Before the meeting someone from Netscape

did telephone Dan Connolly at the W3C to mention they would be

unable to attend the meeting, but were interested in participating

in the working group.<BR>



<P>

There was a brief discussion about including multiple repository

searching, etc. by Long, and Nielsen talked about the meeting

recently held about indexing, Harvest, etc.

<H3>Collaborative Authoring in Microsoft Word - Fein</H3>



<P>

Fein gave a presentation on collaborative authoring in Microsoft

Word, with brief comparisons to other word processors.

<P>

Fein mentioned that the efforts of this group are already too

late to impact Word 8, which is scheduled to be released this

fall for Windows 95, NT and Macintosh.  

<P>

Fein listed the five most important collaboration features for

word processors:<BR>



<OL>

<LI>Revision Marking

<LI>Annotations

<LI>Merging Documents

<LI>Comparing Documents

<LI>Access Control

</OL>



<P>



<P>

Revision marking slide:

<P>

Fein discussed how MS Word and Lotus WordPro both track revisions

to a document by storing the revision history in the document

file. This has the advantage that moving the document to a floppy

doesn't cause the loss of revision information.  The desired capability

is to know who wrote what, and when they wrote it, at a fine-grain

level within the document (i.e., character, word, and paragraph

level).  It is also desirable to have protection from unauthorized

changes by requiring people to submit deltas for approval and

selective incorporation.  One way of providing this desired capability

is to have provisional edits stamped with user/time, which are

then incorporated into the document during an accept/reconcile

process by the main document author. 

<P>

Experience with LAN usage shows that the access speed hit for

storing the revision history in the document is acceptable. However,

Fein suspects this will likely not be the case when retrieving

or saving a file at 28.8 baud (the fastest mass-market modem speed).



<P>

Experience with Microsoft Internet Explorer has shown that converting

a Word file to HTML causes irretrievable loss of revision information.

 Ideally, it would be nice to have the choice of file format be

transparent to the user.  

<P>

Fein also provided a brief discussion of versioning in Lotus WordPro

(not on his slides).<BR>



<P>

Hamilton: The business of posting revisions or deltas as part

of the document file is an approach in OpenDoc.

<P>

Burns: The Dynabook DynaWeb server manages deltas within their

database, and only delivers the version users want.<BR>



<P>

There was some discussion about embedding revision information

into HTML comments.  This has the drawback that it makes the comments

encoded.  Whitehead mentioned that David Durand and Fabio Vitali

are working on a versioned HTML called &quot;VTML.&quot; <BR>



<P>

Annotations slide:

<P>

Unlike revisions, annotations are not proposed changes to the

document. Within Word, annotations are a separate text stream

anchored to regions of the main text.  Fein mentioned the desirability

for annotations which are not links (i.e., a few lines of text

rather than a jump to a new document) to pop up a window within

a WWW browser, after a Word file is converted to HTML.<BR>



<P>

Merging:

<P>

Collaborative editing leads to the problem of integration of multiple

sets of revisions. Current approach: dump all revisions into the

same file, then allow the document editor to choose which revisions

to accept.  Merging has several implications for the Web. First,

merging requires some means of performing revision marking so

users can choose between different revisions.  Second, until all

revisions have been merged, the document is in a half-finished

state, and should not be world-readable until the merge has been

performed in a rational way.<BR>



<P>

Comparing versions:

<P>

The functionality in Microsoft Word for comparing two different

versions of a document was originally developed for the legal

market so they could analyze changes made to a contract by a potentially

hostile party who will not tell you what changes they have made.

This is more difficult than the plain text (e.g. source code)

comparison (or 'diff') case, since there is a need to perform

differencing on logical parts of a document, such as sentences,

paragraphs, and pages, rather than just individual lines of text.

<BR>



<P>

Access control:

<P>

The issue here is how to provide fine-grain (individual revisions

within a document) permissions to different users.  WordPro has

very good fine-grain document access control. A difficult access

control situation occurs when one person's revisions aren't visible

to all members of a work group (e.g., politically sensitive comments).

<P>

It was mentioned that the Adobe PDF document format allows selective

modifications to a document.

<P>

Masinter: It is hard to see how a document can carry this amount

of authorization.<BR>



<P>

Future plans of Word:

<P>

An Intranet Day presentation by Bill Gates demoed two features

of an upcoming Word release.

<P>

Nielsen: The Amaya structured HTML browser and editor (W3C work

performed at INRIA) does this already.

<P>

Masinter: The Shared Books system at Xerox might have done this

too.

<P>

(General acknowledgment that these capabilities have existed in

previous research systems.)

<P>

Some Word 8 features:

<UL>

<LI>automatic URL recognition (and conversion into a browsable

link)

<LI>common office hyperlink model across Office (both user-interface

and programmability)

<LI>web toolbar

<LI>browser integration  (the browser is opened using the DocObjects

extensions to OLE, e.g. Explorer)

<LI>document map (a frame-oriented table of contents style capability)

</UL>



<P>



<P>

One problem they have been experiencing while working on Word

is how to make a user interface which is good for both browsing

and authoring simultaneously.  Certain authoring features are

undesirable during browsing, for example, the feature which marks

misspelled words with a wavy red underline -- the user doesn't

want to know this for sites they didn't author.   One solution

is to have a mode-based interface, with distinct browsing and

authoring modes.  However, Fein would prefer to have editing and

browsing occur within the same mode.

<P>

Long: We encountered this problem in NaviPress as well.  Out solution

is: you are in browsing mode until you place your cursor in the

window, then you switch to browsing/authoring mode.

<P>

Another participant mentioned that Netscape Gold has an authoring

mode which is separate from their browsing mode, even popping

up a separate authoring window.

<P>

Fein discussed the desirability of having the file format (e.g.,

HTML, Word native) and connection type (e.g. LAN, SLIP) be visible,

but still the same operation to the user, for most cases. For

example, HTML should be just one option for saving, rather than

having a separate 'Save to URL/HTML' command.

<P>

Since the native Word document type is a richer format than HTML,

there is some information loss going from Word to HTML.  There

are also some aspects of HTML which don't convert exactly to native

Word format. This causes a problem for 'out-of-band' editing of

HTML, that is, editing an HTML document that was created by converting

a Word document to HTML, and then wanting to recover those changes

back into Word. This led into the broader issue of whether the

Web should support all word processing features.

<P>

Brown mentioned that some of their customers really cared about

the format of generated HTML because they were feeding the generated

HTML into other tools.

<P>

The issue of multi-purpose authoring was also raised: how best

to have just one document type which is good for CD-ROM, for the

Web, for printing, etc.  Especially for printing, bandwidth becomes

an issue. It is acceptable to retrieve a high-resolution image

over a LAN to produce high-quality printed output, but this is

probably not acceptable when working over the Internet, since

it is not as fast.  Are users willing to wait half a day to download

the high-quality files to produce a high-quality printout? 

<P>

There was some discussion about how best to handle writing a resource

which contains many related resources, such as a web page and

associated graphics.

<P>

Masinter: The Web mail group has been working on a way of agglomerating

many files into one file, using the multipart/related MIME type.

 This allows the sending of a web page (many files together to

form one page) via email.

<P>

There was some discussion about the need for a &quot;GET for edit&quot;

method which is distinct from a &quot;GET of source&quot; or a

&quot;GET for browse&quot; (the current behavior of HTTP).  The

need for this becomes clear when revision information is stored

in a resource.  In this case, a user performing an edit may not

want the full source, because they do not want to incur the time

delay of downloading the full revision history, but they may not

want the browsable version either, due to server-side include

processing.<BR>



<P>

Interoperability:

<P>

Existing tools do not all share the same editing model.  For example,

with FrontPage, it is possible to have a company name stored in

one place.  When this company name is modified, the change is

then propagated to N leaf nodes.  This is considered to be only

one change to FrontPage, but it might be considered N separate

changes to another tool.

<P>

Another issue is defining behaviors for less savvy tools, for

example, what should revisions look like to a non-revision savvy

browser?

<P>

Integrations with existing versioning systems -- this topic should

be handled by the versioning working group.

<P>

In conclusion, Fein stated that word processing applications already

have collaboration features, which are not now available in existing

Web authoring tools. Microsoft is committed to a standards-based

approach to collaborative authoring. In the long term Fein sees

Word becoming the main editing engine, while FrontPage will concentrate

on its facilities for site management, offering a higher web functionality.

 

<P>

Schulert: I see FrontPage being a more high-end, more web-focused

tool than Word.<BR>



<P>

Whitehead: Can you tell us which HTTP method will be used in Word

8 for its &quot;Save to URL&quot; capability?

<P>

Fein: Sorry, I cannot talk about this.<BR>



<P>

Nielsen stated that the Word team should use the PUT method rather

than the POST method.  Schulert responded with a discussion about

why the POST method was chosen by FrontPage group.  The primary

reason is that when they began development of FrontPage, POST

was implemented and standard across servers, while PUT was not.

 Nielsen stated that the HTTP 1.1 PUT is now much more usable

for writing content to an HTTP server than the HTTP 1.0 PUT.

<P>

Masinter asked whether the HTTP 1.1 version of PUT is adequate

for putting versions with metadata, and also about the atomicity

of PUTs? Long suspects that HTTP 1.1 still has some problems in

this area.<BR>



<P>

Nielsen: Need to aim for December timeframe to get into HTTP 1.2,

since there are many products being worked on, and HTTP 1.2 appears

to be the last revision of HTTP.

<P>

Masinter: This group needs to produce some input for the HTTP

Working Group by the end of the summer to have results put into

HTTP 1.2.

<H3>Distributed Authoring - Nielsen</H3>



<P>

Nielsen began by reiterating the need to work quickly to get results

into HTTP 1.2.

<P>

Nielsen would like to be able to create a document once and then

have it seamlessly: (1) sent to a friend via email, (2) posted

to a newsgroup, and (3) written to a web page, all using a common

PUT/POST model.  Some issues this raises are what transaction

model is used? What quality of service do you want to have?  Nielsen

used the example of having icons on the desktop representing people,

web servers, news servers, etc. with the capability of dragging

a document onto one or more of these icons and then saying &quot;submit&quot;.

 This causes the appropriate email post, newsgroup post, and web

page write to occur simultaneously with appropriate error handling

when things go wrong. 

<P>

Nielsen also favors using the LINK mechanism within HTML to have

rich relationship semantics among documents.  These links could

serve a number of purposes, for example, serializing a hyperweb

of documents so they can be printed, or linking a table of contents

to chapters of document. These relationships could also be used

to create alternate hierarchies to the containment hierarchy offered

by the directory structure of most existing web servers.  This

more general model can handle web servers implemented on top of

a database as well as on top of a file system.

<P>

In  Nielsen's view, during a PUT, the client may make suggestions

about the destination URL of a resource, but is not in charge

of the name space of the server. The server ultimately decides

where it will place a resource in its name space.  The server

uses the link relationships to determine the location and hierarchical

arrangement of resources within its namespace, rewriting HTML

as necessary to preserve the relationships.

<P>

Some meeting participants were unaware of the LINK tag, and so

there was a brief discussion describing it, and what it can be

used for.  This led into a discussion of the desirability of having

a standard for LINK REL tags (usage convention).  It was mentioned

that  Murray Maloney had previously written a document on standard

relationships, and that the time might be ripe to revisit this.

<BR>



<P>

Hamilton: What about HyTime?  It can project structure onto a

document.  

<P>

Frystyk: Same with Hyper-G.

<P>

Hamilton: There is a need for addition of structure that is not

embedded into a document, like a linkbase system.<BR>



<P>

There was some discussion about the advantages of using standard

link relationships. Concern was raised that a full consideration

of this functionality would take longer than the two months remaining

before the end of the summer deadline for impacting HTTP 1.2.

<P>

Masinter: The two month timeframe is only for changes to HTTP.

 However, there is the PEP (Protocol Extension Protocol) which

can support changes beyond 1.2.<BR>



<P>

There was some discussion about whether there is a need for two

phase commit transaction semantics for PUT operations in HTTP.

<BR>



<P>

Wills: Should versioning be tied to a particular versioning system,

like CVS (Concurrent-Versions System)?

<P>

Nielsen: Versioning should not be tied to a particular system.

 Authoring tools should use PEP to get the operations needed to

perform versioning with a given system.  How a particular versioning

system performs locking and access control will be negotiated

between the authoring client and HTTP server in some meta language.

<P>

Whitehead: Using PEP is not necessary, since it is possible to

implement several different versioning styles using a common set

of atomic operations.

<P>

Masinter: Perhaps the variability between versioning styles can

be expressed in standard ways, such as by using a forms-based

interface.

<P>

Seiwald: Whitehead says we can do a lot with some atomic operations,

which allow for basic interoperability across versioning systems,

so perhaps we should al least do this.

<P>

Nielsen: I don't want to end up with an enumeration of particular

version control systems, but by using a negotiation model common

methods will emerge.

<P>

Masinter: Registration and negotiation is the fallback when standardization

is not possible. It is better than chaos, but standardization

is better than negotiation.

<P>

Whitehead: There are also significant technical problems with

negotiation. For example a lock simply prevents writing to a resource

by all users except the lock holder.  Describing a lock thus requires

an access control meta language, the description and implementation

of which is a difficult problem.

<P>

Nielsen: What goes into HTTP has to be independent of the versioning

model used.

<P>

(There was agreement on this point.)<BR>



<P>

Back to presentation:

<P>

Nielsen: Caching needs unique names for versions and variants

so caches can deal with them uniquely.  

<P>

Masinter: No, HTTP/1.1 doesn't require unique names.  Could perhaps

use a version header instead, which the cache could understand.

<BR>



<P>

There was some discussion about the possible use of entity tags

in a versioning scheme.

<P>

Masinter: There should be some investigation of if-match and PUT

usage.  There doesn't really need to be that much support for

versioning.  There is a tradeoff in putting a new version header

on the request versus putting version identifiers into the name

space.<BR>



<P>

Nielsen mentioned that PUT does not support writing to resource

byte ranges (i.e., sub parts of a resource). 

<P>

Nielsen also mentioned that the Jigsaw server has an integration

with CVS, and that the Amaya browser/editor will be 1.1 compliant

as quickly as possible.

<P>

Nielsen also mentioned the need to make PUT reliable in practice,

by which he means ensuring that PUT doesn't drop data on the floor

during a transaction (lost data is bad).

<P>
There was some discussion about the applicability of SHTTP (Secure
HTTP) for secure writes.  According to Masinter, the SHTTP specification
is in last call and will be approved very soon.  Nielsen expressed
the opinion that SHTTP is very difficult to implement.
