<H2>Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include jimage</H2>

<p>&nbsp;
This section will explain how to set the CLASSPATH environment variable.
CLASSPATH is used by the Java interpretor to
determine where it looks for java byte-code.  The screen shots below show
the setting of CLASSPATH for the file chimera.zip, but you can use 
the same procedure to add jimage to the variable.
</p>

<H3>Setting the CLASSPATH Environment Variable</H3>

<p> Follow the following steps to access the area in NT where the
environment variables are located.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Open the Control Panel.
        <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_settings.gif" WIDTH="286"
        HEIGHT="198"></CENTER>

    <li> Double click the System icon from the Control Panel window.
        <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_control_panel.gif" WIDTH="475"
        HEIGHT="394"></CENTER>
	The Systems Properties window should appear.  

    <li> Click on the Environment tab.  This will display the
        information about the environment variables used.
        <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/nt_environment.gif" WIDTH="408"
        HEIGHT="465"></CENTER>
	Add the variable CLASSPATH and type in the location of 
	jimage. (Note: The screen shot shows chimera.zip as the
	file added to CLASSPATH, you should add the 
	location of jimage instead.)
</ol>

<p> You now should have the jimage set for your Java interpretor.
