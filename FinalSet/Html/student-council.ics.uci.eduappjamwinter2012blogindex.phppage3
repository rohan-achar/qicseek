<p>Our app is nearing completion. Now we are just putting some finishing touches on it. It&#8217;s been a little hard to get the team to all meet up at once, but we&#8217;ve all been doing our parts and everything is stitching together perfectly. In terms of functionality, our app works. Now we are trying to rework the database so that it is a more scale-able design. Our app also looks very nice as well. The menu screens all look very sleek and windows-phone esque even though we made it in android. Tomorrow is just fine tuning, finishing the database reorganization, and working out how the presentation and display will work. Hopefully by Monday, we&#8217;ll have little to panic about.</p>

<span class="submitted">March 3, 2012 &#8212; Team10 </span>

<div class="content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 800;"><strong>Current Status of the Project<br />
</strong></span>The app is now 90% done with the alpha stage. Of the major features to be implemented, a dynamically created History of user feedback (which is retrieved from the server/database) is the only feature left to implement. After this, the app will be in the beta testing stage. Our team will the perform intensive testing. 80% of the UI is in place, we just need to do some polishing and swapping of a few dummy placeholders that we setup throughout the code. A majority of the content is now stored on the database and is retrieved by the phone through a data connection. When implementing this last feature, we are also focusing on handling boundary cases and exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
<em>Android (Client Side ):</em><br />
We made major progress on the AwkTalk client side today. A talented member of our team was able to implement the chat feature between a pair of phones that were connected by the server. This was a very important feature and was the one implementation task that everyone was worried about, as it was the most complicated. Aside from the usual fixing up of code and polishing between activities, we&#8217;ve also now added a new 13th Activity, our settings screen. With this new activity, a user now can customize certain areas of the app.</p>
<p><em>Server/Database:<br />
</em>As stated in yesterdays post, Server and Database is all complete.</p>
<p><em>Design/UI:</em><br />
Our team was unable to work on anything today because we are currently out of town. Fortunately, our team was aware of the situation and we planned accordingly. The design team was able to complete all task assigned/needed before the weekend. When we come back, we will be able to concentrate on the PowerPoint presentation and report regarding our app.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
I think the greatest challenge we are facing as of today is fatigue. All of us have been putting in a lot of time and work to make this app. Since Monday, the team has stayed on campus working together until midnight, on top of their schoolwork and regular jobs. Unfortunately today is the first weekend day we&#8217;ve had but only 3 out of our 5 team members could meet today.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>The app is nearing completion. Most of the individual activities are functional. The back-end is complete and somewhat error tested. The front-end UI is also mostly complete and somewhat tested.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>We implemented most features of the app and are linking all features together. We are working as much as possible to maximize our testing time and presentation preparation time.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>Git pushes have given us the most grief as of lately. Since we are each trying our best to implement our individual components, many XML conflicts arise.</p>

<p>Current Status:<br />
All major features have been implemented and are in a mostly working condition. We also were able to find time to add Google Maps to our app. We also started adding icons to make the app look more exciting. However we still have a lot of work to do: fix bugs, test the app more, clean up some UI issues, and prepare for our presentation.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
We met today at 11am on campus and worked until 11pm. We split up into two groups: one group finishing up current features and fixing bugs, the other attempting to integrate the Google Maps API. After both groups were at a good stopping point, we used Mercurial to merge all our projects into one and spend the rest of the night patching it together.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Our main challenge today was patching together a lot of separate pieces of code. There were also a lot of server side changes that had to be made to implement some of the features we had put in the UI. We also had some trouble getting Google Maps to work on everyone&#8217;s computer. However, we were dedicated enough to spend another full day working on it so we could work through these problems.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong></p>
<p>The app is in a working, functional state and has been tested on our Android devices. Though working, it is still lacking much of the functionality we would like to implement by Monday, including being able to make certain changes to information in the database as well as implementing certain social aspects of our app. We have a good sized to-do list for the next couple days, but given the progress we were able to make today we should be able to finish at least most of what we hope to by the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em></em>The majority of today was spent writing the java code to manage the data from the database locally, writing the php code to connect to the java to the database, displaying the information in the correct activities, and modifying the formatting of our UI to make it more aesthetically pleasing. We also worked on creating an icon/logo for our app as well as our Power Point Presentation and Group Poster.</p>
<p>We also enjoyed a pleasant visit from Adam More today who patiently took candid photographs of us despite horrible lighting conditions (the sun was shining straight through the window and blindingly reflecting off of everything).<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Figuring out how to manage the data after retrieving it from the database was a learning experience for most of us, and after quite a bit of debugging we finally have it working. We have also had some issues with version control, mainly with issues with the project properties and R.java files that don&#8217;t seem to update correctly every time, but it hasn&#8217;t been too much of an issue overall.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>Currently we have a basic, working User Interface for each tab of our application.   We have setup the SQL database and created the PHP files to interface with it.  We have implemented pins, panning, and current location with the google maps api.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Today, finished up the database and started creating java classes to interface with the php files for the database.  We also added Expandable List and List view User Interfaces for our tabs.  We created custom images for the UI and map icons.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>The biggest challenge today was splitting our existing user interface into multiple activities instead of one, so that we could utilize both tabs and list views.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong>The main part of the app is complete, and works quite nicely on Android. The whole team is now shifting focus to the sharing/social feature of the application. We have made a module design for the sharing/social feature.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met in the Courtyard Study Lounge with most of the team. We implemented what was left of the GUI. The screen rotation bug was fixed that was created problems before  and the client side of the coding has begun. We researched the different options we have to implement our sharing/social feature, and eventually decided on one. We spent a lot of time in this research of sharing because we had to see the best way of pushing information to clients when the application data would be updated.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
A challenging aspect of our program was representing data on a server and being able to allow the client-server to communicate efficiently. Another challenge was with subversion conflicts, but that was quickly solved after a member stopped reformatting the braces. We are going to meet again tomorrow in the Couryard Lounge and work on setting up a client-server relationship with the updated data being sent immediately to the desired clients.</p>

Data is still being collected for the app and this data will be stored in the database. Today was mostly about designing our user interface to make it look nice by making the options easier for the user to use, and by changing the colors to make the app look presentable.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>We are still collecting the final data, and we have been using this weekend to make the final touches to the app to ensure that the app is ready to be presented and put on the market.</p>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Current Progress Status:</strong></p>
<p>We have a good portion of the app completed, but we still need to tie everything together. We put off adding some extra nonessential features, but if we can get the app together  in time tomorrow, we will consider implementing them.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>We finished up the individual tasks and worked together to get closer to unifying the app pieces. We worked together to plan for the unification and help each other with parts of the app that needed help.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>:</p>
<p>We have a busy day ahead of us to finish the app. We haven&#8217;t been able to have everyone meet to work together on the app, so we really need to finish up the app tomorrow. Hopefully we can get it done early so we can consider adding some extra functionality. In addition, all but one members of our team don&#8217;t have Android experience, so it&#8217;s been difficult to set aside time to do the necessary research, while still dealing with school and other daily things.</p>
