&gt; Normally SCM systems have a tight association between the checkout
&gt; context and the checked-out file, because often there is no way to work
&gt; "outside" of the SCM system.  But if the SCM system is the backend of
&gt; a version-aware web server, with the actual work happening in "stateless"
&gt; web clients, then that context must be represented by a cookie.
&gt; 
&gt; The cookie belongs to the underlying SCM system; whether it is an MD5
&gt; hash of the document contents, some cryptic string churned up from bowels
&gt; of the SCM database, or "allworkandnoplaymakesjohnnyadullboy" is not
&gt; HTTP's or a Web authoring tool's business.  They just have to keep it
&gt; associated with the checked-out document so that it can be reunited with
&gt; the checkout context at checkin time.
&gt; 
&gt; This cookie is the single most important component of distributed web
&gt; authoring, IMHO.

Hmmm, are you using the general computer meaning of "cookie", or
specifically the Cookie and Set-Cookie mechanisms?  The reason I ask
is that the Content-Version and Derived-From fields in earlier
HTTP drafts were intended to carry that information for versioned
resources, and there is no reason why this group cannot complete
their definition for HTTP/1.2 (in fact, that is what I am hoping).

I suppose that Cookie/Set-Cookie could be used, but there are a variety
of concerns (like which cookie, what is its realm, how do you deal with
normal cookie control for privacy, etc.) which would need to be addressed.
