 <b>Abstract</b><br>
 This study presents an initial set of findings from an empirical study of 
socio-technical processes, system configurations, organizational contexts, 
and interrelationships that give rise to open source software. In this presentation, 
the focus is directed at understanding the requirements for open software 
development efforts, and how the development of these requirements differs 
from those traditional to software engineering and requirements engineering. 
Four open software development communities are described, examined, and compared 
to help discover what these differences may be. Eight kinds of "software
informalisms" are found to play a critical role in the elicitation, analysis,
specification, validation, and management of requirements for developing
open software systems. Subsequently, understanding the roles these software
informalisms take in a new formulation of the requirements development process
for open source software is the focus of this study. This focus enables considering
a reformulation of the requirements engineering process and its associated
artifacts or (in)formalisms to better account for the requirements for developing
open source software systems.<br>
