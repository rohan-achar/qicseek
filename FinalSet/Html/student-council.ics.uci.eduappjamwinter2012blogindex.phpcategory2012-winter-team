<div class="content">
<p>Very interesting day, today was.</p>
<p>We started knowing what we were going to do and we kept that up through the whole day.<br />
Near the end of the day, of course, we wanted to add a few new functionalities, but in the end, we had been able to add all the things we wanted and then submit. I was surprised by the submission process, but we definitely had started it before 11:59.</p>
<p>Overall, our team did a great job producing a great application. Hopefully we don&#8217;t experience unforeseen bugs later.</p>
<p>Some bugs did definitely come up at the end. Luckily the big one was caught.</p>
<p>Although a few bugs probably exist, we pretty much finished.</p>
<p>Things to do better:</p>
<p>Make sure we do <strong>not</strong> create functionality requirements on the last day.</p>
<p>Make sure we build component wise together rather than individually. (Speedy programming basically causes a lot of sub-optimally structured code)</p>

<h2><a href="http://student-council.ics.uci.edu/appjam/winter2012/blog/index.php/day-7-progress/" rel="bookmark">Day 7 : Progress</a></h2>
<span class="submitted">March 4, 2012 &#8212; Team1 </span>

<div class="content">
<p>Before I get into the progress we had today, I wanted to mention that it was weird for me to write Day 7 : Progress when we had only 7 days to finish this. But of course I quickly realized that Day 1 was actually last monday. I now regret not stating that last monday was Day 0.</p>
<p>Today was amazing.</p>
<p>We begun at 10:00 AM and had worked on each of the small components that we had stubbed in in the previous days. After having lunch at Wendy&#8217;s ( which is the only one that was open today near the courtyard study lounge, where we worked ), we started adding functionality to the existing platform. Eventually, we took a break at 4 PM to rest from coding. At 8 PM, we meet up again and got the coolest part of the whole thing working. Our mobile app now updates asynchronously, requesting streaming data from the web server. We had some interesting issues because we had two databases (mobile, and web), and they had slightly different schemas between each other, but in the end everything worked out beautifully.</p>
<p>Our goal for tomorrow is simply to polish the UI and add in icons, and prepare for the presentation. We may add in another view now that we have all the information we need. We also need to change a little bit of code to fit to the newer version of the database.</p>
<p>The challenges we faced were mainly with storing information on the mobile end. It turned out that if we stored all the data in memory, in a conventional list data type, we would exit the application due to memory constraints. Instead we switched to a SQLite database in order to perform quick queries and keep track of things. Since we had to change our approach, some of the older code has a few problems. This will be fixed soon though.</p>
<p>All in all, I am amazed at how well our group is collaborating to get things solved. It&#8217;s a great feeling indeed.</p>

<p>Today we met up at 1 p.m. We have made good progress today and are getting closer and closer to finalizing the app!</p>
<p>Everyone worked very hard today and on individual tasks while pushing them into the version control system. We also ran into some problems and spent a lot of time researching and debugging.</p>
<p>We still need to  integrate the web end and our plan is to meet again tomorrow to combine everyone&#8217;s code and finalize the project.</p>

<p>Today was an individual work day. We worked on separate components individually and kept pushing them into the version control system that we have set up. There has been some progress and overall, I think we will be able to make it. Being able to push in the changes and pull all the other team members&#8217; changes was a very fun experience.</p>
<p>We will be able to continue with the final stage of the project tomorrow as we integrate the web end and the mobile end. It was interesting trying to debug some of the errors we had, because some of the database stuff is new to us all.</p>
<p>Our plan is to meet during the weekend and finalize the project, and then meet on Monday to finalize the presentation.</p>

<p>The project is about 70% done and we are very excited as we have been steadily coding. We started today at 5 PM and by 11 PM we had a lot done. By midnight we had decided on our plans for the weekend and had individual tasks, and everything planned out. I&#8217;m pretty amazed at our steady progress!</p>
<p>Today was a very interesting day in that we had a lot of individual work done rather than cooperative work. Even though we occasionally bounced ideas around in the room and talked about things we needed help with, we pretty much knew what step to take and so we had pretty much worked on the project individually.</p>
<p>One thing we really should do more is focus on prioritizing components of the application. Even though all of the components are important as of now, I feel that if we do not explicitly prioritize the important parts of the application, we may end up polishing the things that will only influence the quality of the final product by a little bit. If we prioritize, we can do even better than we are now.</p>
<p>We decided to finish our individual tasks for Friday before meeting together on Saturday, since it looks like we are working on things by ourselves anyway.</p>
<p>I wonder what we&#8217;ll accomplish by Saturday morning!</p>

<p>As the third day of the Android AppJam comes to a close, I have to say that the team is doing <strong>great</strong>!</p>
<p>Each of us has assigned tasks, and because of the wonder of version control, we can all work on separate files, and as updates happen, we share, see the changes, and keep working.</p>
<p>How <em>exactly </em>are we working? Starting from viewing the drawing board in a semi-circular fashion to complete the UI design, and moving to individual seats to create the stubs, we had finalized in a wonderful pair-programming equilibrium.</p>
<p>Even though we had problems with merging conflicts eventually, we had a lot of good work involving design and initial coding that was done.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to meet tomorrow!</p>

<span class="submitted">February 29, 2012 &#8212; Team1 </span>

<div class="content">
<p>Today was an awesome day for Team eMotion.</p>
<p>We were able to get a ton of things accomplished once we were able to find an empty room on campus for the day.</p>
<p>Today, if nothing else, I learned that the best way to collaborate and work with others is by being open to discussion and question and answer. We were able to manage all the administrative parts of our schedules very quickly because our communication was spectacular; we were all really on the ball.</p>
<p>We were able to created a basic template for our application. install and start up any software we need to use for collaboration (e.g Git), organize our meeting times for the rest of the project, and resolve all the bugs we had trying to manage the version control system with our project.</p>
<p>It was great to be able to collaborate together and set our path for the rest of the week in such a short amount of time. Even though meeting times may have been an issue until now, and problems came up while installing, by keeping our thoughts flowing, and sharing them with each other, we have already started down the path to completion at a fast pace.</p>
<p>I am excited to see what will happen tomorrow.</p>
