<P><B>Deliverables</B></P>

<P>As has been discussed in class, you have substantial flexibility in
choosing the specific form for the content of your deliverables. Below
is a list of items that should be included.</P>

<P><B>Understanding and Plan (First Phase)</B></P>

<P><B>1. Understanding.</B></P>

<P>Placing this subject in the title was a way to tell you that one of
your major tasks for the current period of time is developing an understanding
of the various technologies and tasks concerned wiht your project. This
includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing your
task as well as the technologies that you will be extending/enhancing/changing.</P>

<P>In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained by writing
an intrduction to your project that highlights the important points. It
should also include</P>

<P>* Sales Brochure - To describe your product to any outside audience.</P>

<P>*Description of activities done in support of understanding - like interviews
with the customer, for example.</P>

<P>Hint: One of the best ways to gain an understanding, or re-engineering
of a piece of software is to interview the original developer.</P>

<P><B>2.Project Plan</B></P>

<P>You could use a tool like Microsoft Project to help you with this task.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>As seen above, apart from specifying the team structure (manager, secretary
etc.), write the technology specification, i.e. have for each technology
that you described in your understanding section, one person who is going
to be the team expert in that technology.Similar to how the team organisation
provides an internal or external contact point for resolving issues with
respect to yoru project, the technology chart provides an internal or external
contact point for who is the point man for each technology. </P>

<P>These are the deliverables for the first phase.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>Requirements &amp; Documentation ( Second Phase)</B></P>

<P><B>Requirements</B></P>

<P>This of course , is the full description of what you are going to do.
You've done these before, in ICS 52 and ICS 121, so you have plenty of
&quot;model documents&quot; to draw from, to help you determine how to
structure this statement. Keep in mind that key objectives of a requirements
document are</P>

<P>(1) Completeness -- everything is described<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
(2) Understandability -- the &quot;customer&quot; can read it and be convinced
that all his objectives and needs are adequately and accurately described.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
(3) Utility -- the information in the document can be used effectively
to help in the design phase (eg. an OO requirements analysis can aid in
development of an OO design)<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
(4) No Ambiguity -- every reader will come away with some understanding.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
(5) Consistency -- No contradictions</P>

<P>Use diagrams of course , to help give appropriate overviews and understanding.
Note that pictures may well be an essential element of the complete description
of any graphical inetrface. You could use story board techniques to present
usage scenarios.</P>

<P><B>Documentation</B></P>

<P>This section is reserved for documentation you have developed during
this phase of the project. Specifically, if during the course of developing
the your understanding of the various technologies involved in the porject,
you discovered items that were not documented, but which were important,
then you should include that here.</P>

<P>Aditionally you should list here the major sources of information that
you will be using during the remainder of the project.</P>

<P>0. Introduction</P>

<P>Expand your introduction to discuss your specific approaches to the
design of the system.</P>

<P>1. Understanding</P>

<P>This will basically be the same as in your previous document. Make sure
you describe what steps or actions you took to understand each technology
or software. If you make changes to this section, add text describing why
the change was necessary, and why it more accurately reflects your new
understanding.</P>

<P>2. Project Plan</P>

<P>This will be an iterative expansion of your previous section.Expand
your project plan to represent how you have accomplished the work so far.
Expand your task network or work breakdown structure to the level of detail
needed to complete this task. Based on the work you have done, revise your
estimates on how much your team can accomplish and deliver. If you make
changes, add text describing why the change was necessary or why it will
improve the ability of your team to accomplish the work you have proposed.</P>

<P>3. Requirements</P>

<P>This will basically be the same as in your previous document. If any
requirements are changed, added or deleted, make this explicit. Describe
why the requirement was changed/added/deleted and by whom ( customer, developer,
etc. ). Again make sure your requirements meet the objectives of completeness,
understandbility, utility, no ambiguity, consistency.</P>

be kept, sub-directories, Makefiles , etc.</P>

<P>V.Requirements Cross Reference - what objects/modules satisfy what requirements?
Make a table, make a table, make it complete and consistent.</P>

</UL>

<P>5. Documentation</P>

<UL>
<P>I. List the documents you have developed during this phase of the project.</P>

<P>II. Reference Documents</P>

<P>List here the major sources of information that you will be using during
the remainder of the project.</P>
</UL>

<P>Team /Peer Appraisals</P>

<P>The following team/peer appraisals will be used in part to determine
appropriate project grades for each team member. Each team member <B>must
</B>fill out a team/peer appraisal packet. These packets are dure on the
final day of your presentation. All students must email this completed
form to both taylor@ics.uci.edu and rema@ics.uci.edu to receive a grade
for the class.</P>

<P>Please divide 100 points between your teammates according to their level
of participation in your team's project. Do not assign any points to yourself
-- just to your team members. If you feel all members have contributed
equally, then assign each team member 33.3 points ( assuming there are
four members). If on the other hand, if you feel that one member did far
more work than all others and one member was not helpful, you might give
the more active member 45 points, the less active member 20 points , and
the other member 35 points. Please try to be fair.</P>

<P>Also comment <B>briefly</B> on each team member's performance. Your
evaluation should focus on standard evaluation criteria, such as technical
competence, effort, productivity, creativity, quality, dependability, communication,
initiative, decision making, and leadership.</P>

<P>Please assign a number between 1-5, 1 being worst, 5 being best for
each teammate, for each attribute.</P>

<P>competence : possesses or seeks required knowledge<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
Effort : tries to accomplish assigned tasks<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
Productivity : level of work generated<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
Creativity : conceptualised usful, innovativce approaches<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
