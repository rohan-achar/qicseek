<H2>5. Related work</H2>
<P>
This section describes related work in hypermedia toolkits, open hypermedia systems, groupware toolkits, and integration techniques.

Hypermedia toolkits provide applications with hypermedia abstractions and services in much the same way user-interface toolkits provide user-interface services. Typically, applications make use of these toolkits by subclassing the hypermedia classes provided. This allows an application to specialize the classes for its domain while taking advantage of the hypermedia services provided. HOT [<A HREF="references.html#ref15">15</A>] provides a set of C++ data and view classes and is useful for constructing closed hypermedia-enabled applications. Garrido and Rossi [<A HREF="references.html#ref10">10</A>] provide similar services to SmallTalk applications. This hypermedia framework, however, provides specialized graphical widgets which can be used to provide link markers and navigational services. These widgets depend on the application using the rest of the hypermedia framework in order to function properly.
The primary difference between these toolkits and the TI technique is one of focus. The former provides classes used to gain hypermedia functionality; the latter provides graphical widgets which provide hypermedia services automatically. In the former, the impact on an existing application is greater since the application must be modified to explicitly use the provided classes. In the latter, the application simply swaps non-integrated widgets with integrated ones. Not all widgets have to be swapped either, since integrated and non-integrated widgets can coexist freely in the same interface. The effort associated with the swap is minimal, at most the developer has to provide the context information required by the integrated widgets' constructors and implement a callback routine to respond to link traversal events which require the display of a different object. Finally, the latter makes use of an OHS, allowing toolkit-constructed applications to interact with any other OHS client, whereas the former can only create closed hypermedia applications.

DHM [<A HREF="references.html#ref11">11</A>], Hyperform [<A HREF="references.html#ref21">21</A>], and HyperDisco [<A HREF="references.html#ref22">22</A>] all provide hypermedia frameworks which make use of an underlying OHS. These toolkits share the differences the ones above have with the TI technique except for the last; since these frameworks access an underlying OHS, the integrated applications can interoperate with any other OHS client. However, the TI technique shields the interaction with the OHS from the application developer since this interaction occurs within the integrated widgets. Thus the effort associated with using the technique is still lower than with these frameworks and the services provided by the technique match the navigational capabilities of partially-integrated OHS clients [<A HREF="references.html#ref22">22</A>].

The TI technique however cannot match the high-end features provided to both partially- and fully-integrated OHS clients since these frameworks are capable of providing sophisticated features like versioning and collaboration [<A HREF="references.html#ref22">22</A>]. Support for such features can be provided in one of two ways. If the underlying OHS provides these features, the toolkit integrator can use them within the integrated widgets. Otherwise, the TI technique could possibly be used to integrate a different type of system which provides the desired features. The application would then make use of the widgets which accessed both the OHS and the new system. This approach and its associated problems are discussed in <A HREF="futurework.html#sec6.3">Section&nbsp;6.3</A>.

The CSCW field has conducted research into the requirements of groupware, and has produced toolkits to aid in the construction of groupware systems. Three notable examples are GroupKit [<A HREF="references.html#ref16">16</A>], Rendezvous [<A HREF="references.html#ref12">12</A>], and Suite [<A HREF="references.html#ref5">5</A>]. These toolkits are relevant to the TI technique in the way in which they integrate user-interface and groupware services. There are several major differences. First, these systems do not use a separate service to provide groupware features; instead, the toolkit is the groupware system. Second, the focus of these systems is not on enabling widgets with groupware services. Rather it is on sharing entire applications between participants of a collaborative session, including not just an application's user-interface but application state as well. Finally, as a result of the previous difference, these toolkits place significant architectural requirements on client applications in order to take advantage of their services. This encourages the development of new applications built in the toolkit's style but makes it more difficult to adapt existing applications.

Additional work has been performed in the area of integrating hypermedia services into applications. One simple but powerful example is reported in [<A HREF="references.html#ref6">6</A>]. A text widget was modified to access the hypermedia services of an OHS. As a result, any application which made use of the new widget gained hypermedia functionality. The TI technique provides this type of integration to all toolkit widgets, however at a potentially lower level of service. The difference is that the source code of the text widget was directly modified to achieve the integration. The TI technique attempts to provide its services without modifying the original widget. Thus the level of service provided may not be the same as achieved with a custom integration.

Kacmar provides a different integration technique in Freckles [<A HREF="references.html#ref13">13</A>]. Freckles integrates the windowing system of a user's environment with an OHS. The title of an application's window is used as the context to associate hypermedia structures with an application. Link markers appear as small rectangles (actually separate windows) which are associated with particular windows. Mouse clicks on these markers invoke hypermedia operations. Additional operations are accessible in a menu provided by the hypermedia system in a separate window. Since all link markers appear and behave the same, this technique provides consistent cross-application hypermedia services similar to the TI technique.
</P>
<P>
This technique requires less effort to integrate an application than the TI technique. The only modification required is for the application to respond to a link traversal. The TI technique further requires the application make use of the integrated widgets. This additional requirement, however, provides a deeper integration than the Freckles technique. Freckles provides an environment to rapidly prototype and evaluate hypermedia functionality within an application. The visual look and feel provided by the link markers, however, cannot be easily incorporated into the application as a functional component. In the TI technique, the integrated widgets are the link markers and already exist as a functional part of the application. Thus, in this context, the TI technique can be seen as a way for developers to ease the developmental process of incorporating hypermedia functionality, once they have determined from the prototypes that it is appropriate for their applications.
