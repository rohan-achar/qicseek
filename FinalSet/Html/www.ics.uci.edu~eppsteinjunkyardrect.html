Rectilinear Geometry
</H2>
This includes geometric problems defined on squares and rectangles,
higher dimensional boxes, cubes, and hypercubes,
right triangles and other right-angled figures,
and "taxicab geometry" in which distances are measured
in terms of axis-parallel paths.

Can one partition the square into triangles with all angles acute?
How many triangles are needed, and what is the best angle bound possible?

What is the smallest cube that can be put inside another cube

There is a simple solution, but it seems difficult to prove its correctness.

This is NP-hard, but I don't know how easy it is to approximate;
most related work I know of is on optimizing the rectangle size for a cover
by a fixed number of rectangles.
